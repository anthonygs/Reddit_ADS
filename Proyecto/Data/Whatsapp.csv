What did WhatsApp update this time?;1;l6egin;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/l6egin/what_did_whatsapp_update_this_time/;1;I heard so many people saying that WhatsApp updated or changed their terms and conditions, saying that they will see your data, messages, and everything else. Is that true?;2021-01-28 00:09:03;"No. WhatsApp remains end to end encrypted and no-one *read your messages. 

They're changing their terms and conditions in a few months to allow communication with businesses (which won't be encrypted because they need to be read by AI) and as part of that they will pass back to Facebook stuff like how often you message businesses etc, so they can show you ads.

But your personal messages to friends are not affected, and if you aren't messaging businesses, it's not a big deal."

(One was a group chat and the other was individual if that matters.)

Each message of a conversation (group or private) stays in that conversation.

I dont think people should be panicking;0;l4u266;whatsapp;https://youtu.be/JAaP47mQzWA;6;;2021-01-25 21:30:05;"lol so the argument is whatsapp is bad, but every other app will be bad eventually, so no need in switching. That's a rather pessimistic standpoint.

Also it's probably not true. Whatsapp was basically doomed whence they were bought by facebook. Both Telegram and Signal know they will also face mass exodus when the dare selling to whatever data hungry company.

There's nothing wrong with jumping ship when its sinking, and i would definitely climb another ship that's trying to save me after, even though that ship might not float forever. lmao what a joke, also full of  misinformation  
""your info will be leaked"" when signal doesnt have your info in the first place, stop spreading lies Use signal! Signal has no information to leak. The only data they collect is the date you register and the date you last used the app. All other data i.e. text/picture/video, and audio/video calls are encrypted, including metadata. They cannot connect a phone number to an identity. Signal is also a non-profit that subsists solely on donations. Use signal ! Stop the misinformation and don‚Äôt choose telegram [deleted] Beep.

What if I use an unknown number?;0;l4f20o;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/l4f20o/what_if_i_use_an_unknown_number/;6;"I think my BF is chatting with other girls on Whatsapp. If I create an account using a Google voice number that I've given to no one, 1) can I see when he's online since he would be in my contacts? 2) will anyone be able to see me since they don't have my number, but it will import all my contacts? 

Sorry if these are basic questions, but I don't really understand how Whatsapp works.";2021-01-25 06:37:08;"Time to get into a new relationship.You got trust issues.Not Whatsapp issues. This question seems to be more related to /r/relationships than tech topics.  As I think there's an underlying issue that needs to be addressed first.

In a healthy relationship you should feel safe. You can't love what you are afraid to loose. A relationship is healthy if there's no need to control and encourages personal growth.

Take a time to think over about the reason you think he might be talking to other girls.

Is it because a previous partner had cheated on you? Therefore you felt you weren't good enough? (Specially if it was your first relationship)

If a partner doesn't value your company that's beyond your control. You can know if he does if he's a priority in your life and wants you to get involved.

Is it about some gossip you heard? There are envious people who just like to destroy relationships.

Is it about some misconception about people? Maybe you know about several cases of partners who cheated on your friends. If most of your friends are insecure, statistics will be in favor of failure stories.  
And yes, some people do cheat. That doesn't mean everyone is a cheater. It can happen, but doesn't mean is your fault. If you're really afraid someone will cheat on you then it just means you're not ready for relationships.

If that is the case I strongly suggest seeking a therapist. There's no shame on it. It's the same as seeking a doctor for a headache. It's part of our health and wellbeing. Besides, you will get much better (professional) advice. While the people from online communites can have good intentions, we might be wrong. 1) You can see when he is online through that number. But you may not see his last seen/last online time if he set 'Last seen' to 'Nobody' or his 'Contacts' only.
You can check this by looking through your parents' WhatsApp or friend's WhatsApp whose number are not with him.
2) He can't see if you're monitoring him.

Next thing is none of my business. But how can you make a good assumption by monitoring his online activity? I was thinking the same. Though the issue needs to be addressed before. Otherwise a new relationship will just repeat the same pattern. Ok I'm not sure I knew those were different things. 

I guess I won't know for sure. I know he has the app on his phone but don't know who he's using it to chat with. There's no way to tell that from my end, is there? No you can't see whom he is talking to WhatsApp. I may suggest you to ask a common friend about your doubt before stacking too much worrying thoughts."

In the process I must have reinstalled some version of WA and verified my number about 15 times (cos it didn't go smoothly at all). 

The final migration went to shit such that my chat history on my android is fucked. Fortunately, I have a msgstore.db.crypt12 from before this all started. I would like to uninstall WA then reinstall, to get my backup back into the state it was when this began. 

The problem is: when reinstalling WA on android the final time, I was 'temporarily banned' for 20 mins, citing useage of 3rd party apps. Which indeed, I was using. However, I am concerned that part of the problem could simply be how many times I resintalled the app and verified my number. 

I am TERRIFIED that if I uninstall and reinstall (to restore msgstore.db.crypt12) I will get permanently banned- even though I wouldn't be using a 3rd party app, but simply because one more verification might push me over the edge.

I just deleted my What‚Äôs App account.;40;l46egj;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/l46egj/i_just_deleted_my_whats_app_account/;34;"And I‚Äôm feeling a bit listless right now because my group chat with my besties was giving me great comfort during this past year especially. 

I exported my main chats and media to my computer. I messaged a couple group chats to tell them that I was migrating over to Signal because I didn‚Äôt want to reward Zuckerberg for bad behaviour. 

Not gonna lie: I‚Äôm feeling sad that I‚Äôm not in the group chats anymore. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm going to feel more lonely. 

As for What‚Äôs App terms of service, I don‚Äôt even know what is true anymore. I wanted to better explain to my friends why I was leaving, with hard facts, but it‚Äôs really hard to make a case to people, especially those who don‚Äôt care or don‚Äôt see What‚Äôs App/Facebook as a threat.

Does anyone have a cheat sheet that I can send to my pals to convince them to switch?

Hopefully my fears of loneliness are unfounded. 

Godspeed.";2021-01-24 22:56:46;"I didn‚Äôt text anyone except my crush(priority) about leaving whatsapp for Signal. She has come on Signal :)
Whoever else wants to talk to you will always find a way my dude. Till then use the call feature on your phone. It still functions Did you follow through and delete Facebook and Instagram as well? I've had much more luck convincing people to switch to Telegram just cause it has more features + you can set the WhatsApp-styled theme there, which makes it more familiar. If only they had some kind of way to sync chats from WhatsApp, so I don't have to lose tons of message history, that would make transitions sooo much easier. I wouldn‚Äôt delete WhatsApp. 

Every app you use will need funding to keep up with growth. Eventually Signal won‚Äôt be able to function without capitalizing on its user base. ‚ÄúDonations‚Äù are not limitless. Just see you on r/privacytoolsIO lol btw I agree with you very much. I would like to quit WA but that I won't do this because it's so popular and useful in Italy, it's the main app for everyone. It's useful for school, for work and other things. I would like to come back at email ahahah. Anyway Mark Z. knows it and he plays his cards. The fact you can't explain why you left WhatsApp says it all, I guess. The best you could do is leaving WhatsApp. That's the strongest message you could send.

&#x200B;

Now, to rally my friends over to WhatsApp, I created the groups in Signal and then went to the setting of the group and copy the link to said group in order for them to join in very few taps (Only one, if they have signal already). Along with it I post the following ""Following WhatsApp/FB decision I will soon leave WhatsApp for good and I'm already over to signal where I created the exact same group with the exact same feature and you can join me over there !""   


Really don't worry about it, your friends will join, maybe they'll keep WhatsApp or not as well but you won't feel apart too long. Is the problem specifically WhatsApp, or is the problem across all the messaging apps? > Hopefully my fears of loneliness are unfounded. 

Nobody will follow you this way tbh. Good luck. I just changed my number (for business) reasons and notified very few contacts. Sadly I can't delete my account entirely, yet. For the rest (and future contacts) they can find me on Signal or Telegram. If they've been following my updates they already now.

The ones who truly care about you will join. I have managed to convince a lot of people to switch. I joined signal feeling comfortable with everyone being there. The only person I didn't manage to switch is my SO. Not gonna lie, even with all my contacts on signal, I still feel lost without her. I would suggest..
Read 10 Arguments to delete your social media right not by Jaron Lanier..
Will Give you a broader image of what Social media is doing... Hero! Well that was stupid. Hi, look at here, there is 5 reasons to leave Whatsapp : [https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-security-threats-whatsapp-users-need-know/](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-security-threats-whatsapp-users-need-know/) Good luck with your crush :) I gotta say: my partner without question or hesitation downloaded Signal. That was nice. üòä I‚Äôll be honest, they‚Äôre deactivated but not deleted. I don‚Äôt use the mobile apps. But I realize I‚Äôm still part of the network. 

I use Facebook for only marketplace and neighbourhood groups. 

I‚Äôve scrubbed my FB history going back to 2008, and don‚Äôt feed it barely at all. 

But I take your point! Signal actually just released an update for it to be feature rich like What‚Äôs App. I‚Äôve been telling my closet friends about it, hoping they‚Äôll come over. 

For some reason, two of my friends think Telegram is the way to go. I just wish they would take my word about Signal, considering I‚Äôm the techy one of the bunch. 

Yeah, it would be nice to port the messages over to the new messenger, but them living on my computer is good enough, I think. Would make it easier to bring others in, tho. &#x200B;

Yes they are, if an app is considered precious like Wikipedia people will donate. Wikipedia just puts out a little campaign saying please help us and they are funded instantly. I can explain it, and I‚Äôve tried explaining it to them in various conversations over the years. I‚Äôve talked about surveillance capitalism, a lot. Some people don‚Äôt care. 

My post was about how to speak to people who don‚Äôt normally think about privacy to start thinking about privacy. It‚Äôs tiresome trying to explain things all the time, and doesn‚Äôt always work. Personally...I'm not much on the privacy side of the talk..
Rather going against Facebook cause the more data we feed facebook..
The more radicalism spurs..more violence and what not..

If a significant no. Of people switch to any app telegram or signal..(i use both of them)(sadly am still on whatsapp,will be deleting after my mid term ends.üòÖ)
It will show that no one supports hate and violence..
And shaking the roots of Such a Big tech..will Provide future tech companies to make a better version Of social media. Would you know what's holding her back? Is it that her social circles are refusing to move over? I call bullshit on all points. Either the arguments are way besides the point and/or they are just as valid for any other platform. 

But hey, go feel lonely without your friends. 
At least Facebook won't know you're talking to them, since you're not. my partner downloaded telegram as soon as I told him I downloaded it! c: Why did you leave WhatsApp? Her friends and family are on WhatsApp Yeah. They will miss the eternal company of the algorithm zucking their private thoughts May your conversations live forever in plain text on somebody else‚Äôs hard disk drive! Because my phone knows too much about me;
I don‚Äôt trust Facebook; private messages are incredibly more private than posting to a platform like Facebook; don‚Äôt want to give any more power or legitimacy to Facebook; don‚Äôt know how much they will truly glean from my mobile data; don‚Äôt respect their general business plan of obfuscation and data extraction by forcing users to agree to their terms of service, or be shit out of luck; don‚Äôt want to reward poor behaviour or turn a blind eye to the social discord that Facebook has facilitated without any consideration of its consequences. 

The alarms raised about these new Terms of Service got me thinking that I don‚Äôt want a part in that, and that I don‚Äôt have to, when there are good competitors out there like Signal (which I‚Äôve had for several years, but hadn‚Äôt gained much general acceptance until now). Wow. Seriously? That‚Äôs not good. I gotta find a link which shows this, since one of my friends likes Telegram more because of the stickers, which is insane to me because I never use them. i mean, i still use WhatsApp as well. Migrating to a different messaging app is not an option in my community, but some people have. > Because my phone knows too much about me

Then stop using your phone. Telegram chats are not end-to-end encrypted by default. It's only those 1:1 ""secret chats"" (can be initiated from the regular, personal chat's menu at the top right) that are end-to-end encrypted. That's how Telegram is a downgrade from WhatsApp. WhatsApp uses Signal protocol, to offer end-to-end encrypted by default, on all 1:1 chats, and on all group chats. Telegram doesn't do any of these, with focus on offering better functionality -- native apps, speed, stickers, bots and more. 

Overall, Telegram and Signal/WhatsApp are for two different purposes, but if someone is moving from WhatsApp to Telegram for ""privacy"", they must be made aware that this is a downgrade. 

Telegram's chats being hosted on the cloud (vs local storage as in WhatsApp/Signal's end-to-end encrypted chats), any of the Telegram staff can read the messages. They promise not to, but there is no way to verify that."

Utopia Network includes Utopia Name System (UNS). This is a decentralized registry of names that are impossible to expropriate, freeze or corrupt by 3rd-party. Utopia has built-in Idyll browser to view websites within Utopia peer-to-peer network. Do you know why you can't delete messages after 1¬Ω hour? Because WhatsApp deletes the messages from their servers after 1¬Ω hours. That's how end to end encryption works. Nothing is stored on their servers because it's more secure. The messages are stored in encrypted format for 1¬Ωhour and then deletes. Once the messages are deleted from their servers there's nothing we can do. That's why we can't cloud login like telegram and others but instead the message history are backed up in gdrive I think

I'm not justifying WhatsApp new privacy policy by any means. It's fucking bullshit indeed. And more they try to convince us the suspicious it gets

Edit: correct me if I'm wrong Well, every system has it's disadvantages. WhatsApp's data is not stored on their cloud and it is stored locally, in your device. When they delete it on their server, it becomes impossible to delete it, hence, half hour time limit.

Additionally, cursing and swearing is not helpful for anyone. Makes sense, I'm not aware about how stuff works backend but couldn't they just send an encrypted id attached to the message to all clients in the group which the clients phone would then delete so whatsApp doesn't even need to store the messages and can't ever get details about the message itself but only a specific id set to it? I have no idea if that'll work. But it's an interesting idea tbh"

Signal let people track your IP through a call somehow... This has all since been patched, but I'm worried with everyone switching to other messenger apps that they'll be the new popular target for hackers.. I'm not sure if I should stick with the 'devil I know' or switch and risk an app that could be data breached in a few months I finally got rid of the WA spyware and successfully deleted my account & afterwards the app. Now people told me that they still see my account and wondered why I don't respond.

Yeah I meant location based on IP, I agree that phone number is much worse. Didn't they fix this by putting everything through their Signal server (if enabled)? I'm somewhat familiar with tech stuff but networking not so much People forced me to use WhatsApp for years, chill out, man. You're being weird. Location from ip is less accurate then phone area code, you can ""fix"" it by enabling phone calls thru their servers (still very safe) in settings"
Move WhatsApp messages from Android to iPhone;0;l3vr19;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/l3vr19/move_whatsapp_messages_from_android_to_iphone/;1;"I recently got a new iPhone and was wondering how to migrate data from my previous phone (Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite).  After much search and reading reviews from reputed sources, I went with buying a third-party app called¬†Wondershare Dr. Fone for iOS/Android.  

It uses several tricks to accomplish the backup and restore process.  While I was apprehensive and uncomfortable with its approach, it worked ‚Äì  all the data from Android WhatsApp came to my new iPhone without any noticeable issues. Since the app acquired a lot of permissions, I  uninstalled Dr Fone app and iTunes promptly from my PC once I got the data migrated to iPhone.

My friends Whatsapp got hacked;4;l2gq1v;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/l2gq1v/my_friends_whatsapp_got_hacked/;9;It's telling them to wait till 11 hours or more and asking for pin did anyone can help me please;2021-01-22 08:12:00;"Same, I'm currently hacked too. Unfortunately waiting didn't do anything in my case. I suppose I'll have to get a new number...  


What happened with me was I got a message from an account pretending to be from WhatsApp staff asking me for my verification code which I also received via text message. I sent it to them without thinking and only after sending it realized that I got scammed.   


Anyways, I started getting calls from foreign locations which I assumed to be from the scammers asking for money. I ignored them.  


In return, the scammers have somehow blocked my SMS verification so I cannot get into my own account and I'm logged out.   


I'm just going to get a new number tomorrow and I suggest your friend do the same. It's not worth the headache to try and resolve the issue. Also, this is an important lesson xD We tried many times to get code but unfortunately we are not successful Get everybody on signal . Switch to Signal. What do you mean get a new number - a whole new phone number? I got hacked today but I deleted my account - am I safe to activate WhatsApp again on the same phone? Already but I'm sad too How did you delete your account if you got hacked? For me, I got logged out of whatsapp after sharing the verification code.... So I shared the verification code and nothing happened but I freaked out and deleted my account. I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôm safe but unsure I see... I think you can activate whatsapp again but do it at your own risk. I personally don't know what will happen. I just downloaded Signal. /you should do the same!"

When needed I send / forward messages to those groups. 

To create an 'empty' group create a group with a friend of yours and after creating the group remove your friend from the group.

Same trick works with signal and threema too btw. I have done that too. But ends up being like an ordinary message sending First save your own number to your contacts. Then click on that newly created contact. You will find a WhatsApp icon and ""Message 'phone number' "" written beside that. Then you can send messages to yourself. I have just tried it. When I save myself on  WA it doesn't show my own number Thats overwhelming. You don't need a group for messaging yourself. It worked. Thanks, I really appreciate it:) You don't need to but it works for my use case. I store messages I like from various chats/groups and forward them to that group category. 

Like a group for quotes will contain the quotes I like so when I need to forward/use them I don't have to scroll past every message in all the groups to search it, I can just got to the group for quotes and see the quotes there.

So a separate group for every category I am interested in. That is not possible if I message myself. You're welcome :)"

Checked opened sessions on Whatsapp Web. Everything was fine, no open sessions.

10 minutes later I was logged out again. With a waiting time of 6 hours to log back in.

Fuck, what can I do now?";2021-01-21 02:20:50;"I reckon there's more to this story. Pretty sure the scenario you wrote is impossible to happen, more so with 2FA. This is not the first time I'm reading about this kind of thing. What's going on? So I waited 6 hours and asked for another verification code. Never got any code by SMS.

Verification by call doesn't work either.

Now I have to wait 13 hours. Awesome.

I reinstalled the app and I will try again in 13 hours. After that I have no idea what else to do.

Just checked and I'm able to receive SMS normally from other services. The problem is Whatsapp for some reason.

EDIT: just checked my email. There are 2 emails from Whatsapp asking to disable 2FA. I guess someone is trying to deactivate it. I can only hope whoever it is, is now unable to use the app.

I read that 2FA is kind of easy to bypass, he or she only has to wait 7 days and it won't need 2FA apparently. Ridiculous.

EDIT 2: had to reinstall the app and reboot iPhone. Waited a lot but managed to get my account back.

I fear that the hacker might come back after this 7 day period (which is absolutely nuts). I hope not. There is no way someone can log into your account without the verification code. I'm completely lost on how this could have happened with 2FA. I'm seeing quite a few threads like this on r/ whatsapp... something fishy is definitely going on..."

I'll warn you, though: it can be pretty uncomfortable, so don't use BlueStacks if you plan on using that account a lot.  
 
For starters, you only get the notifications if both BlueStacks and the WhatsApp app in it are open.  
Downloading media is also kinda annoying.  
Then the account can only be accessed from that computer, because the WhatsApp Web procedure is overly complicated and you'd then be able to use the Web version only on a phone and exclusively by clicking ""Desktop site"" in your phone browser's settings.

If you just need to chat with it, you're good to go, but, if you're using a laptop, you have to use a mouse because scrolling the chat without a mouse wheel is maddening."

WhatsApp privacy policy update 2021 | Insights;7;l145ar;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/l145ar/whatsapp_privacy_policy_update_2021_insights/;1;"  

WhatsApp privacy policy update 2021 is an update to make Facebook the largest digital marketing hub. What are the consequences?

WhatsApp users are shifting to other Apps in response to the recent **WhatsApp privacy policy update 2021. What is it about? Why is this backlash?**

WhatsApp had a massive number of users by 2020 accounting for about two billion people accessing WhatsApp monthly. However, a steep declined has been observed due to the recent **privacy policy update 2021**. WhatsApp users are shifting to use other related messaging application such as telegram and signal. 

Since the launch of Facebook in 2004, the company‚Äôs strategy is evident to buy the potential rivals before they hit it such as Messenger, Instagram, Oculus, etc. Similarly, Facebook owned WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion and by 2015, it was known to be the largest messaging app having 2 billion worldwide users by 2020. 

After, joining the Facebook umbrella, WhatsApp offered its user with an option to choose if they want to share their data with Facebook. However, with the recent **WhatsApp privacy policy update 2021**, everyone is desperate to find an answer to ‚ÄúIs WhatsApp safe and private?‚Äù

Facebook was launched as a social media platform but soon it made its way to *social media* *marketing*. Now, Facebook has become a favorite platform for any digital marketing agency for its features like, business pages, sponsored & Classic Ads and stories, and much more. 

Just as WhatsApp co-founder, Brian Acton had stated, Facebook is widening its horizon being very good ‚Äúbusinesspeople‚Äù. This is evident from the **WhatsApp privacy policy update 2021**. With this statement, let‚Äôs dig deeper into the privacy update. 

You must be well-aware of the privacy policy that pops-up when you install the app. It requires your permission to access your data for the proper functioning, improvement, customization, support and marketing of the App services. As the [WhatsApp privacy policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en) states, this collection of data depends upon your usage.

Before **WhatsApp privacy policy update 2021**, all that WhatsApp required from you was your account information such as your phone number, profile name. It does not retain the messages on its servers rather on the user‚Äôs device. However, it stores the messages on *servers* only when it is not delivered in encrypted form for 30 days and deletes it afterwards.

**So what has changed now?**

As far as, WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, the recent privacy surge is nothing new. Facebook has a long list of privacy lapses. The most agreed upon opinion about this privacy update is because Facebook tends to integrate all the Apps it owns and make it a perfect [digital marketing](http://www.navicosoft.com/) hub. It seems to be the first approach of a [social media marketing company](https://www.navicosoft.com/social-media-marketing/). The five icons on the bottom of Facebook page is the evidence.

The internet has gone head over heels as WhatsApp sent an in-app notification to its users. Either you accept **WhatsApp privacy policy update 2021** and continue using the app or you will lose access to your account. No choice in between. Period.

This update is most likely to facilitate a [digital marketing agency](https://www.navicosoft.com/digital-marketing-agency/) with the better insights to the customer‚Äôs data. You must have seen the option of adding WhatsApp button to Facebook pages. This is it! The automatically collected information by WhatsApp includes time, frequency, duration, log files.  

However, the big deal is that it collects information about your hardware model, OS information, mobile network, connection information including your phone number, mobile operator and ISP, IP address, device operations, and identifiers even the ones unique for Facebook Company Products. The **WhatsApp Privacy Policy clearly** mentions that it uses your IP address and other location-related information. 

As a consequence of **WhatsApp privacy policy update 2021**, WhatsApp is facing a huge backlash from users and a large number of users are shifting to other related apps as well. However, to address the issue, WhatsApp has issued a clarification that it does not collect data from one-to-one messages but your conversation with a business account to help the business market with audience reach.";2021-01-20 10:15:04;Hey there, I'm using Signal! üòâ

I then uninstalled whatsapp and reinstalled it and backed up everything, and when I check that group chat the messages aren't there. I only deleted one of the messages for myself before I uninstalled the app. Would those people be able to see the messages I sent?;2021-01-20 04:13:12;"If you still don't get what I'm asking then: If a message is not read by people in a group chat and you delete WhatsApp, do those messages get deleted? Most likely they did receive/can read those messages.  Once it's sent from your device it's sent, uninstalling the app doesn't affect anything.  Next time you should delete the message for everyone. Whatsapp doesn't backup in real time line telegram. If you didn't manually backup before uninstalling, you'll lose everything since 2am of that day, at least. I'm confused though. Before uninstalling whatsapp there were 2 messages I sent which were just left there, and after reinstalling whatsapp those two messages aren't there anymore? I didn't delete them but I can't see them. Did you do a manual backup right before uninstalling the app?  

If not, those messages were not backed up so your phone doesn't show them after restoring, but WhatsApp had most likely already delivered them to the other users.  You essentially deleted the messages locally but not for anyone else. I didn't but thank so you so much for explaining and answering me 

I now wish I could just die right now By chance do you know any way I can restore a message without backup? I do not know if there's a way to do that, sorry.  If you want to know for sure what happened with those messages, perhaps you could ask someone in the group to send you a screenshot? No it's okay don't worry. Thanks for helping out."

Or is it just for the WhatsApp Business click to chat? did they remove it ? no results for me when I tried it I am confused by this. What exactly does it mean.
If I Google my phone number and WhatsApp oh will bring up my webchat messages.

Or are they just random webchat pages. Could someone look at my chat history this way?

[deleted] If they were dedicated enough they can manage to find your chat history Chat history leaked... Again Is it necessary to insult other people? Telegram is shit, e2e disabled by default, the e2e is often critized by experts, it's for profit company, ect
Use signal lol How? Just using random numbers? I really don't understand all the hate Telegram is getting from some of the Signal fanbase. Its e2e encryption is working, as shown in [this paper from last month](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03141v1.pdf) (unless you have a serious source pointing in another direction, in which case please let me know).

I personally prefer the cloud chats, because it allows for syncing across as many devices as i want, and i can view video's whenever i want without having to save them on my device. I also like the privacy Telegram gives me by not having to show my phone number to those i chat with. Telegram and Signal both have their perks, why can we not use both, or at least not hate on each other? I personally wouldn't trust any for-profit company with my privacy especially one that's planning to sell adverts

it's pretty clear to don't care about your privacy if e2e encryption is disabled by default

Their servers are closed source tonight it's completely unacceptable, they're also hasn't been any third party audits, they log IP addresses among other data, 

And here is review of MTPROTO showing it's weaknesses (there may be better papers but I don't have much time to look right now)
https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1177.pdf The first point is up to you of course, you are free to trust whoever you want! What i don't really understand is why Reddit/Google/Android/Apple/whatever other for-profit software we use is any different. Now don't get me wrong i fully support the idea of being able to sent encrypted messages, and if i would need to do so in a group setting i'll use signal for sure. It's just that Telegram is usefull for other things, just like Reddit and Google are.

All databases ever don't use e2e, but that doesn't mean they don't care about your privacy. Your online bank also stores your data on their database, and so does Google drive/Apple cloud/Dropbox etc. In order to get to your messages, one only needs to crack the weakest point, which usually is your phone. If someone else were to get access to my phone, they would have access to all of my signal messages, but i could log them out of my telegram messages, since they are not stored locally. I'm not saying that one is better than the other here, just that each has its own uses. Also worth a mention is that Telegram claims they split up the encryption keys for your cloud chats across different countries, so that no one country can force access. I think it speaks for itself that Telegram is banned in several countries, while Whatsapp (which is, like Signal, always e2e encrypted) isn't.

For the servers being close sourced, that doesn't really matter right? Even if they were open source, there is no way for any of us to check if that is indeed the code they are running. 

Thanks a lot for the paper you just sent, but i think this still refers to the old encryption Telegram used (MTProto), which indeed contained several weak points. Because of this they made some improvements (MTProto 2.0), which have been proven to be sound according to the paper i referenced above. 

Aside from the discussion, thanks a lot for your reply! I've been reading a lot about this for the last couple of weeks, and i've been enjoying getting more informed. Comments like yours help a lot in this regard. \> For the servers being close sourced, that doesn't really matter right?  Even if they were open source, there is no way for any of us to check if  that is indeed the code they are running.

it matters, you can host your own signal server and set signal to connect to it

&#x200B;

Mtproto 2.0 is still has lots of issues (some fixed and some new)

&#x200B;

\> Google drive/Apple cloud/Dropbox etcyou may want to check out r/degoogle

while that is an extreme your chats are something that should be treated privately

&#x200B;

also telegrams secret chats have lots of downsides to useing them, such as little fetures and not all telegram apps support it"

Like many others here I intend to leave Whatsapp soon and migrate entirely to Signal (and some limited use of Telegram - possibly on desktop only). The critical mass between friends and family has reached to the point that most of those I care to be in touch with have already added/ migrated to Signal and/or Telegram. The rest will probably follow.

That said, what is everyone doing here in terms of backup/ archiving their entire Whatsapp history? I have years of conversation (individual and group) that I may need to refer to from time-to-time, not just for personal but work purposes as well. Most solutions seem to backup to a proprietary format that's unreadable unless you continue subscribing to the program (which seems to mostly be the case). Is there something, for example, that can create HTML backups of all conversations with the media embedded in it?

Any suggestions?";2021-01-19 13:26:42;"Nothing? Trying to find the same for the last 6 months, still no luck Has anyone used CopyTrans contacts? They seem to have an option to export to multiple html/ pdf / word etc. that looks good!

[CopyTrans How to backup WhatsApp](https://www.copytrans.net/support/how-to-backup-whatsapp-messages/) There is an app which does that. But it needs rooted device. Backups are encrypted so you need keys to decrypt them I use 2 different tutorial to do this.

Everyone will mostly endup moving to telegram or to signal Ironic that they care about privacy now. They've been trying to get Whatsapp to build a backdoor so they can read people's messages. [deleted] asks but according to what law? All the Facebook spyware is again above Signal in the  App Store Every country that can, has asked WhatsApp access to their servers. Sometimes security agencies have to work, you know. well if some random stranger you barely know (or a friend, or your crush) asks you to use your phone and starts looking at your texts in whatsapp, search history and your gallery even tho you are not a criminal and you have nothing to hide you wouldn't want to give them the phone to do that, so why give facebook your data, Mark Zuckerberg is just a doll played by NSA and CIA but for a legal reasons that's not true, and why allow facebook collect your data and threat you as a product not a customer.. DM me your social security number, your credit card numbers and PINs and some voice samples for bot training. Edward Snowden remarked ""Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. So no problem with a webcam in your bathroom or your bedroom either?  
because you have nothing to hide.  


Nothing to hide ‚Äì as long as you agree 100% with the outlook and policies of your government.  


would you be alright with an goverment agent standing at your mailbox, taking  your mail from the mailman, reading it, and scanning it before he put it  in your mailbox?  


If you have nothing to hide, then why are there curtains on your  windows. What are you trying to hide? It is simply a question of  privacy, not guilt.  


If you think privacy is unimportant for you because you have nothing to  hide, you might as well say free speech is unimportant for you because  you have nothing useful to say.  


The  right to privacy is the right to self.  You ""own"" you.  You decide when  you want to share you and when you don't.  It is really just that  simple.

There are also things we,  as a society, have decide we don't think is generally right to share.   This is why we have bathroom stalls with a door that can be closed and  locked versus just using toilets on street corners.

As long as there have been windows, there have been curtains.  Privacy is part of human nature.  


hope this helps No they don't have to have access to our messages. Calm down , I already said in my original post I wasn‚Äôt aware of what privacy is being given away , I thought it was just messages and I thought they were encrypted, I didn‚Äôt realise all the other things were being shared WhatsApp can make up any bullshit about ""end-to-end"" encryption, but Facebook being the monopolistic Nazi corporation that it is, will always find a way to manipulate and misguide you. Stop trusting Facebook and any statement they make Who will decide that? You?"

Thing is, not only i dont recognize the voices at all, i dont have the slightless idea of where these came from, the names and location of the voice recordings(along with a couple of tests i did) points out that these arrived from whatsapp, but i dont remember anything related to them neither i have any conversation they could have arrived from, i've had the same cellphone with whatsapp for over 5 years, yet this files apparently arrived on November 2019 and January 2020.

Whatsapp running 1 hour 23 minutes on background ?;1;l09xrl;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/l09xrl/whatsapp_running_1_hour_23_minutes_on_background/;8;"So I realized for the past 2-3 days my battery percentage is draining more than it's usual, and I'm pretty sure Do Not Disturb is not the cause of it. I took a look at battery usage, and I found that below Whatsapp, it says Background Activity, and I click on it, it's doing 1 hour 23 minutes on background, and only 5 minutes on screen. 

Now the thing is, Whatsapp is not open on my phone, and it's not even on the background, I literally force close it few days ago and I hardly open it on my phone, the only time I use Whatsapp is through ONLINE web using my computer. So could this Whatsapp's background activity be the one draining my battery percentage overnight ? I lost about 8-10% overnight when my phone is idle, in the past I lose around 2-3% which is normal, but now seems like it's not.";2021-01-19 05:22:44;"Gotta copy that personal data üòÜ How do you think it received new messages? It's always running in background to ping the servers. I hope that isn't true üòÇ But it's really weird that it's running more than an hour of background activity when I didn't even had it on background and my phone is idle overnight. 

Thinking if I should delete it to save my battery life. So it'll always be consuming large amount of battery even if the app is not on the background, even if i receive no messages for the day ? It seems to only be WhatsApp though, the other social messaging platform is fine. Same thing happened yesterday to a friend with android. They even got the android system warning saying that the app was excessively consuming battery on the background.... wondering if the same happened to you... is really weird Yes, the exact same probably and most likely happened to me now. I was leaving my phone overnight idle, and usually it drops a very reasonable and normal percentage of 3-5%, but for the past few days, it's been dropping more than 8-10% when I woke up.

I finally checked the battery usage and found out that Whatsapp's background activity is shooting sky rocket. What did your friend did to solve the issue ? That‚Äôs very strange... she did nothing. I‚Äôll ask tomorrow if the problem persist... you could try reinstalling the app ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ok, I'll try to reinstall the app and see if it solves the issue but I doubt so.

Then people will complain companies are abusive with prices and so on. Ab they will miss the time where companies accepted my super interesting private life as credit

Dumb fucks! Take the free stuff and learn to ignore the ads. Tell me more!?! üòÆ

I'm actually alright with them keeping the data I've already provided them, I just plan to make it outdated and make myself unreachable for their ""personalised service"".

My Instagram, Facebook and Messenger are not deleted but deactivated. I'll happily reactivate them temporarily if when I will need the particular connection that doesn't exist outside of their platforms (i.e. travel, diaspora, expats or accomodation searching groups). I'm breaking up with Facebook. It's not them, it's me. üòâ ""my users are dumbfucks""

M. Zuckerberg I think it's individual.

I'm moving away from Google, too. Basically from every service that sells customer's behavioural change via personalising service and adds.

I could write pretty long post about my personal experience, but I think it's enough to write that I want my apps to be tools. I want them:
1. To do everything I want.
2. To do it in a way I want.
3. Not to try directting my wishes and thoughts.

Thus, app which doesn't know anything about me nor how I use it is a perfect tool, while app which profiles me is pretty much anti-tool. Cause people don't know how any of this works they probably read it on a bloody FB post. It's really funny thet they think someone cares about what they do or think they will be safe in another app. If you have a bloody smartphone f off, you don't have a private life no more. People will never be offered the chance to pay. And even if they did, they would keep on spying. Microsoft corporate services is in trial for sharing data with Facebook. 

Basically, it‚Äôs  either FOSS or spyware. There are very few non-spyware private apps Your Facebook profile is updated when your devices ping Facebook servers through scripts that are integrated in almost website, because, as Zuck says, people are dumb fucks People are dumb fucks. No need Zuckerber says that. Just go out and look. Big brother is watching you 24/7 ü§£ \>they think someone cares

it's not people caring, it's about logarithms creating profiles of your behaviour in order to better milk your wallet That means payed apps doesn't work because people doesn't use because they have to pay. 

FOSS apps cant compete because many people use them but very few pay.

What's the solution then? I'm slightly disgusted by anything connected to web development, thus my web stack knowledge is bit superficial. Do you want to say that tracker blockers don't work as advertised? People are dumb fucks ‚â† my clients are dumb fucks It's not (only) about watching.

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fduckduckgo.com%2F%3Fq%3Ddopamine%2520driven%2520feedback%2520loop

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=personalised+persuasion+algorithm Ah of course, but that's the point, it doesn't matter if you uninstall WhatsApp or whatever, as the other comment pointed out Google is doing it, Facebook always did. The idea that one can escape that it's naive.

I got a cat a few months ago, right now I have tons of ads about cat food n stuff. It's a pain in the ass? Yes but I know there's not much I can do about it. Are you unable to come up with your own ideas? I was under the assumption that no tracker blockers were used. 

I am a total noob on this thing as well, I just despise surveillance capitalism corporations Aren't the clients people? You can use DuckDuckGo which offers really good results which aren't personalised. I revert to Google less than 1/10 of my searches, mostly for stuff (professionally) related to mathematics, AI or programming where Google has both better indexing and where personalised results based on my search history actually do me good.

When I'm researching about my personal doubts, or about end to end encrypted decentralised social networks, or what the hell is happening across the Atlantic, I don't want Google to bias my results with their agenda. I want as rich results as I can find, and filter what is bulshit on my own.

If you disable trackers (and adds üòÅ ) in Mozilla, than, suddenly, you cripple algorithms which target you in a way you're mentioning.


How much does one care about your behaviour and thinking? See advertising income of services you use - that's how much people care about it.
It's not you, personally. It's you as part of customer base.  To think that it's only others who are affected is pretty naive. It‚Äôs not about escaping. It‚Äôs about reducing damage Are you able to come up with any idea at all?

Or are you waiting for Ironman to twit some fro you? Oh, I totally share the feeling of being creeped out by surveillance capitalism companies, and I'm actively researching how to stop spyware. :D
Checkout Mozilla Firefox browser. It has pretty configurable settings for privacy + lot of interesting addons. Other browsers I was considering were Ungoogled chromium and Brave.

That's how far I got. Currently, I'm figuring out which addons are trustworthy and which combination works best. Yeah, well thanks for the advice pal. I mean i have ads disabled and personally don't give two flying ducks about what anyone tries to sell. And maybe I'm not explaining myself clearly, I understand that I'm gonna get affected too. I get that it's not on me as an individual but about the consumer info I can provide to the companies. I just think that i can't really escape all this that easily, but definitely are gonna give DuckDuck go a try and  do some more research. Until pretty recently, I was loving every bit of personalised service I could get, readily accepting the tradeof of being targeted for behavioural change. ""They know what I like, what's the problem?""
So, I think I can identify your perspective üòÅ


I'm glad this made you interested in Duck. When you'll be researching it, checkout bangs: https://duckduckgo.com/bang

They are shortcut which lets you to use Duck's search bar for searching any service you can think of by including it's bang before your search term.

Your WhatsApp Information (GDPR) Report and other thoughts;3;kzz2kb;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kzz2kb/your_whatsapp_information_gdpr_report_and_other/;2;"I helped my mom request her Whatsapp info report. The report took 5 days and was surprising sparse in detail. Here's what's in it:

**Section: User Information**

Displays your information and your device. What is included is your phone number, current devices and the OS info, whether you have a desktop web app, the phone's IP, profile pictures, a list of contacts, and a list of groups.

**Section: Terms of service**

Mostly talk about whether you opted in or out of the 2016 and 2018 agreement.

**Section: Registration Information**

List platform, carrier, device, and registration time of the current device.

**Section: Settings**

Privacy settings and a list of blocked numbers.

**Thoughts**

Note that the following are strictly my opinion and should not be taken as facts and this section ended up. I apologize ahead of time that I start rambling and deviating from the report.

I was surprised by how little info is here. My impression is that currently Whatsapp currently cannot read your messages but can read your metadata. I was under the impression that they log info like when you login, who you talk to and how long and battery level etc. This is not reflected in the report. The report is therefore a redacted version of the real report and contains only the minimal information. The reason it take so long is probably because the report is being redacted by a human person, who must review it for further redaction before sending it out. The report is so sparse, it should have taken a few minutes to generate.

The user information section shows that Whatsapp knows about all of  your contact and their phone numbers. Not listed is probably info on when and how long you talked with each contact or what groups you spend most of your time in. This is just speculation on my part, because it's not in the report.

The terms of service hides a rather steady erosion of terms of service. There was a 2016 opted out to share data, this was followed by another terms of service which has even less things to opted out from. This makes sense because Facebook makes its cash by advertisement. They make less money on you if you opted out.

To be fair, the controversial new terms of service appear to be targeted at business communication. So from the various article I read, your communication with your individual will remain private, but communication with business would be shared with third party. So if you whatsapp your mom, then it's private, but if you whatsapp the pizza shop, the data that you like sausage could be sold to a different vendor. This seems fair enough, but Facebook has proved that they are bad at securing your data or at least it's not high priority. Recently someone notice that you can google search membership of Whatsapp groups (the loophole is probably closed by now). Because they make money off ads, your security is not their priority. This is an issue that affects just facebook. A lot of company are bad at keeping data safe because it does not affect their bottom line. They start doing it when legislation like HIPPA starts showing up.

Based on the Whatsapp's ambition in countries like India, it would appear that they want whatapps to become [WeChat](https://WeChat.It). It would be big money to facebook if they can get business to join and make a ton of money through Micro-transactions. I actually don't mind this except for the issue of control. It would be cool if I can control my profile completely and have the option to opted out and opted in, but corporation don't want to do this, they want to control everything and lock you into a walled garden. The dark path would be a future where this leads to a social credit system where you are given a score. People who refused to join are shunned, while those in control will game the system so that they always have a high score. This is closer than you think, some countries already have something similar in place.";2021-01-18 20:22:08;How did you request the information? In WhatsApp select account then request account info.

What I think about the new privacy police of WhatsApp;1;kzv1nb;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kzv1nb/what_i_think_about_the_new_privacy_police_of/;4;"
Many people have asked me what I think about the new policy carried out by Facebook, that is, sharing WhatsApp data with third-party companies with the same parent company, I honestly believe that we all knew that from the moment a multinational led by the  'enumeration of the data of its users, and therefore basically on advertising and user profiling, I think we all knew that sooner or later WhatsApp in some way would still have to guarantee a profit to Facebook.  Also because if we do a calculation in hand, in 2014 when WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook it had a billion users up to that moment WhatsApp cost on average more or less ‚Ç¨ 1 a year, but the metadata that is generated have a value of  much more profitable market, therefore from the moment in which WhatsApp becomes free for all its users it automatically means that the user is the value or rather the product itself that the company sells, Facebook knows this very well and from the moment we say it  clearly does not have a very clean image, this Renumeration process does not surprise that Facebook gave an ultimatum about 7 years after the acquisition thinking that people were more inclined to access their generated data for free.

 What do I think about this whole affair?  That basically Facebook would have had to leave the option of being able to continue to pay WhatsApp for not having advertising well even for a figure higher than ‚Ç¨ 1 a year, in this way it would have guaranteed a sort of freedom of choice for the consumer,  I believe that basically Facebook will arrive at a reasoning of this type albeit with a bad taste in the mouth.

 And you, what do you think?



Molte persone mi hanno chiesto che cosa ne penso riguardo della nuova politica portata avanti da Facebook cio√® il fatto condividere i dati di WhatsApp con aziende terze con la stessa azienda madre, sinceramente credo che tutti quanti sapevamo che dal momento in cui una multinazionale guidata dall l'enumerazione dei dati dei suoi utenti, e quindi fondamentalmente sulla pubblicit√† e la profilazione dell'utente tutti quanti credo che sapevamo che prima o poi WhatsApp in qualche modo avrebbe comunque dovuto garantire un profitto a Facebook. Anche perch√© se facciamo un calcolo alla mano, nel 2014 quando WhatsApp √® stata acquisita da Facebook contava un miliardo di utenti fino a quel momento WhatsApp costava in media pi√π o meno ‚Ç¨1 l'anno, ma i metadati che vengono generati hanno un valore di mercato molto pi√π remunerativo, pertanto dal momento in cui WhatsApp diventa gratuito per tutti i suoi utenti vuol dire automaticamente che l'utente √® il valore o meglio il prodotto stesso che l'azienda vende, Facebook questo lo sa benissimo e dal momento in cui diciamocelo chiaramente non ha un'immagine molto pulita, questo processo di Renumerazione non sorprendersi che Facebook abbia dato un ultimatum a distanza di circa 7 anni dall'acquisizione pensando che le persone fossero pi√π inclini accedere gratuitamente i propri dati generati.

Cosa credo di tutta questa vicenda? Che fondamentalmente Facebook avrebbe dovuto lasciare l'opzione di poter continuare a pagare WhatsApp per non avere ben pubblicitari anche magari per una cifra pi√π alta di ‚Ç¨1 l'anno, in questo modo avrebbe garantito una sorta di libert√† di scelta da parte del consumatore, credo che fondamentalmente Facebook arriver√† ad un ragionamento di questo tipo seppur con l'amaro in bocca. 

E voi, che cosa ne pensate?";2021-01-18 16:53:14;"I guess Facebook wouldn't charge only 1 euro for it, because the amount of money they would not get by not selling the data would be pretty larger. Even if this charge would be enough to maintain the app, they would certainly push for a bigger profit.

I think that today's TOS change is not that shocking, but if we can't move on to another app now, we won't be able to do that collectively (we simply don't go to another messaging app alone) when Facebook risks our rights and privacy more seriously. i was already reluctant to use whatsapp because of FB but at one point i had to.

I was already pretty pissed because of the change around OCULUS (Mandatory FB account)

&#x200B;

This ultimatum was the last straw. I've send several day warning my groups about it, migrated some to signal, some people don't care about FB. Today i just deleted my whatsapp account.

&#x200B;

I spent a lot of time removing all my data from google, it's nearly done (that's a long process..), i won't start sharing anything with facebook. I completely agree with that because for example there are so many different apps where to choose for example I live in Italy and here a lot of persons ( the 95% something like that on mines Contact agenda) have also telegram for trading , check public transportation, music and other stuff, but you can imagine how much lazy are the people to change their habits About Google I don't know where you live but but here in Europe it's a pretty easily, I mean Google give you all access and controllo about your data just in one page where are you can remover everything's in just two clicks  from Google assistant and chrome to play store and personal adv"

Telegram has some nice features like channels, and much larger groups. But the reason you don't see these features in signal, not in WhatsApp, is because both are much more private than Telegram.

Use SIGNAL;103;kzq1u5;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kzq1u5/use_signal/;34;"It's funny how my parents , who took a year to learn how to use WhatsApp, are moving to SIGNAL.  
The learning curve of WhatsApp is being used by SIGNAL quite efficiently.";2021-01-18 10:42:13;"Just done the switch to signal away from dodgy WhatsApp. Found and installed the signal desktop app, it would be good if it had the full function of the phone app. I'd love to experience being an old person who can't learn how to use technology as fast as us. Really wonder what it's like. Anyways, try to convince Telegram users to use Signal too and backup their chats themselves. Use 
Signal 
. What's wrong with WhatsApp WhatsApp did the job right, for once. With its simplicity, it has taught the masses how to utilize it properly.

Signal literally copy and paste the UI/UX, no wonder people can easily adapt. Signal is not safe too. Generalized behavior. telegram, whatsapp, and signal are pretty much the same.
use a message app that does not ask you to give away your list of contacts : https://www.olvid.io/en/ Back up my chats myself? What year is this? I'd rather have the option of E2E encryption than have it as my only option and have to manage my backups.

E2E is nice for when you absolutely need 100% security, but it has major drawbacks as well. For one, it's device to device, so you can't have an account set up on more than a single device at a time. That means no standalone iPad or PC app, and if you lose your phone, all your message history is lost too. People forget that Gmail, Drive, Dropbox, Slack, and almost every other service is not E2E encrypted either, and for good reason. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/kzik0a/a_visual_comparison_of_app_privacy_information_in/). They're greedy for personal data See here - https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/kzy7kr/updated_comparison_of_messaging_apps/ Weren't there any messaging apps before WhatsApp appeared? As if WhatsApp reinvented the wheel with a messaging app It didn't 'copy and paste' Signal's founder is the same dude who created whatsapp, it's his own personal design. This is no copypasta in that. elaborate FAKE NEWS! ? Wdym Telegram had no end to end encryption by defaul, and the encryption is highly critized, also closed source server I have on my phone and two computers at the same time, and the phone doesn't even need to be on, so who cares if you lose it. Idk where you're spouting all this BS from. It's fine if e2e's optional, but the thing barely even tells you it exists and the desktop apps on Windows and Linux don't support e2e, so are many people even going to bother using it? Not to mention that at least with WhatsApp, chats are encrypted even if metadata isn't, because in Telegram, *nothing* is, if you forget to use secret chats.

It's also technically possible to have e2e cloud-backups which Apple at least said it was planning to do until the FBI knocked on its doors. Not sure why Signal doesn't implement it either but maybe it's not a huge priority, because I mean, people don't care about 'backing up' all their videochats, voicechats, etc. The backing up your everyday cat photo discussions isn't all that important, anyways. I wonder how much people actually use their backup history instead of just crying 'but muh backups!' but never actually use them. Thanks Actually, MSN Messenger was the market leader before wide smartphone adaption and it was the most capable, fun to use messaging app.  Had they migrated to smartphones at the time, probably other apps would really had had to uphill fight. true lol This has nothing to do with invention. False. Signal has long existed before Acton moved on fom WhatsApp.

I wish ignorant people do not speak. How does it actually matter? The good ole days, with yahoo messenger. Sorry if you misunderstood. I meant that WhatsApp is not very new about a chat app with bubbles.  And in order to establish a new app everyone can and want to use, you gotta make it like the existing ones. I don't know how you can relate signal UI with WhatsApp's they look different. Yes, it really does, it's a big problem that people aren't caring about these problems The chat rooms  too,until the were haunted by lechers ,sickos etc .As usual in all apps in India.

Yeah but that kind of misses the principle of it. Like images are saved locally, why not a private use report, as it explicitly warns against using untrusted apps because it has sensitive data.? Yeah strange why they set it up like that. Oh another way you could do it is by saving your own number as a contact, then sending that file to yourself. Sent it to my sis, still not saved locally.

Found this chart from a channel named Friday checkout very interesting though.

Telegram is not open source, only the client has the code public. The server is closed source. Telegram is literally putting ads in channels (and WhatsApp reversed their plans about putting ads in status), how is that not being in the ads business? This is a terrible, terrible graph for anyone who hasn‚Äôt seen the video. It is confusing in every sense of the way. and once hundreds of millions of users switch to Signal , how are they going to handle the server load? Where does the funds come from? A channel named Friday checkout? 

That's TechAltar!  ü§£ How do Telegram and Signal pay their bills? And ""metadata"" too Yeah, saying that telegram is open source without explaining this is borderline misleading Didn‚Äôt want to start a flame. My opinion is that server code is as important as client code: you know what data they collect by the client but you don‚Äôt know how they use them. Server code being open-source isn't that crucial since you can't verify what's actually being run on the servers. The apps are open source and reproducible, so you can check that nothing bad is going on, easy as that. Telegram api is opensource its not a graph. its a chart. 

no wonder you‚Äôre confused üòÇ simple, sell it to Facebook again lol That‚Äôs my concern, will they get enough in donations. Telegram only encrypted secret chats, normal and group chats can be read by them. I‚Äôm currently considering switching to Threema Donations to the foundation Watch this video for clarity https://youtu.be/lOyP8WHmjVw from 3:44 but some 3rd party auditors could have a look , and having backend server code on GitHub is at least sth to be verified , in case of telegram it‚Äôs a secret.. That doesn't make sense. /u/ginghis, I have found an error in your comment:

I consider this post by you, ginghis, incorrect; it should say ‚Äú~~its~~ [**it's**] a chart‚Äù instead. ‚ÄòIts‚Äô is possessive; ‚Äòit's‚Äô means ‚Äòit is‚Äô or ‚Äòit has‚Äô.

 ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!) Then wtf's the exact difference between check and circled check? No I understand it's ""Do not share Metadata"" and ""No Ad business"". But you've written that in a confusing way. Then you have to trust the auditors, and they can just change anything right afterwards anyways. Lol, you guys r biased they are many apps available on playstore that are made from telegram api Actually, he should have capitalized the first letter, so your grammar bot answer is also incorrect. There is also a semicolon missing to separate the subordinate clause. The sentence should read as follows:   
""It's not a graph; it's a chart."" In case of telegram you don‚Äôt have a chance even to think about such an option cause it‚Äôs not possible In case of telegram you don‚Äôt have a chance even to think about such an option cause it‚Äôs not possible Biased towards what?

Yes, there certainly are apps that use Telegram's public API. That's what an API is for. But it doesn't make sense to say that it is open source. An API, as the name says, is an interface. It has no source. Exactly. Sad to see one of the top posts on the Telegram sub now being a photo gallery of 'message me on Telegram' profile pics for WhatsApp in a bunch of different languages. It's like politicians saying 'don't let a crisis go to waste' and misleading ignorant people to using something that can be arguably worse."

Signal is the better choice of the free messaging apps.

Major proof that WhatsApp is not truly encrypted as Facebook claims;22;kyx5go;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kyx5go/major_proof_that_whatsapp_is_not_truly_encrypted/;16;"IMO the biggest proof is that WhatsApp is widely available in many countries which have authoritarian and dictatorship governments and WhatsApp is actually one of the very few chat apps that is ‚Äúapproved‚Äù. A friend of mine lives in a middle eastern dictatorship, signal is banned, telegram is banned, wickr is banned but WhatsApp is allowed. This is the case in various countries that ban signal and telegram and wickr but allow WhatsApp. There are also many cases of ppl arrested for saying something on WhatsApp 

IMO this is the easiest and biggest proof that your chat in WhatsApp can be accessed by governments via backdoor or certain arrangements with Facebook and that Facebook has been lying for years about this";2021-01-17 05:18:21;"It's also entirely possible that these governments only allow WhatsApp since it's the norm, and blocking it would create severe backlash. Personally, I believe the content of WhatsApp messages is truly encrypted, but everything else isn't. Perhaps those govts have ways (keyloggers) of accessing content before it is encrypted or after it is decrypted, on user's phone.  In that case, they don't care that WhatsApp internally is safe. The kiss of death. Any app allowed to operate under the sight of dictatorship. Yet people do not care in huge numbers. WhatsApp has been banned in Iran several times, and there was even a famous court case in Brazil where WhatsApp was blocked for 12 hours because it couldn't hand over messages. There's nothing new in the privacy law of WhatsApp... I'm observing since years that WhatsApp contacts are shown as friend suggestions on Facebook and Instagram... many apps like WhatsApp have access to our data, when we click on allow to access contacts after installing...  And also if people switch to other apps, then Mark Zuckerberg has the capability to acquire them too üòÖ The content is irrelevant. ‚ÄúWe [the United States of America] murder [foreign] people based on metadata‚Äù
National Security Agency's bulk surveillance programs, former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden admitted that metadata is used as the basis for killing people.

When you share What with whom.

Your identifier, your location and your usage are linked to your identity, according to their ‚Äúnutritional label‚Äù. That‚Äôs all the metadata you need

Furthermore, do you trust Mark Zuckerberg? Whatever it is, it is allowed to happen by WhatsApp / Facebook.  as signal, telegram and wickr and are all banned. This is the case in every single authoritarian country If that‚Äôs the case they are just making everyone agree to them sharing the data to Facebook for profiling and marketing to avoid yet another court case and even more fines. 
The biggest issue is if they are sharing data to Facebook who seem to be particularly good at leaking user data, there is an increase in risk of id cloning or some such nightmarish situation. Sure it‚Äôs a small risk but it‚Äôs enough of a ball ache when some bastard gets your credit card details which happens easily enough even when you are super careful. In that case I‚Äòll be making my own app. Easy money. NSA has access to everything, including this conversation.

And furthermore, Mark Zuckerberg has the capability to acquire other apps too, what will you do then? I doubt WhatsApp / Facebook could prevent a keylogger from being installed on a user's phone.  And I doubt your sweeping statements about all / every. You implying facebook can listen to our activity of other secure apps? I don't think they can access other secure apps, your debit/credit would require OTP and they are so highly secure... And also you have to make the world use your app:) He cannot purchase what‚Äôs not on sale and Signal is not on sale. 

It must be sad that his $20,000,000,000 customers flock to apps where he cannot use them No, I‚Äôm simply implying they are incompetent and have leaked data on several occasions. Said leaked data can aid in identity fraud. As an example, from a quick google search, 2020, 2019 and 2018 have Facebook data leaks in the news. Some containing user phone numbers. WhatsApp = user phone numbers which is personally identifiable info. That‚Äôs potentially along with everything else they know about the millions in peoples details they leaked Some people display their details like phone numbers and address as public, I have seen such profiles, if people want they can display it to their friends or don't display at all


It's their choice.. if they display it on public domain, it definitely can get leaked :)"

How does Facebook determine whether someone lives in Europe?

E.g., many of the Europeans have non-EU phone numbers (e.g., Google Voice burners). And in normal years many have lots of international travel as well (thus location data wouldn't help make a determination).

Second question, do we know if & how Facebook ensures that no additional data about Europeans is transferred when Europeans interact with non-Europeans on WhatsApp? E.g., a large group chat with 1 American and 99 Europeans, or a 1on1 conversation with a non-EU participant?

Need help before deleting whatsapp;4;kynpte;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kynpte/need_help_before_deleting_whatsapp/;5;"Hello everyone,

I am so glad to find this sub & I really appreciate your time and efforts to help others to get rid of whatsapp. 

Like the title says, I am too moving out to other platforms, in fact I am already using Telegram but haven't deleted whatsapp, just yet. 

I have few questions and I really hope someone can answer. 

1. What is the best app to use for reading whatsapp messages from backup on the pc. There are tons of apps for backups from iPhone like, i-mazing, any-trans, etc but none I could find for Android, since I am using android device. 

2. If I transfer whole backup folder of whatsapp, do I still need the key because what I understood is that when backup, the key remains in the phone. How can I use the backup in pc without the key? [if I even need any] 

I am sorry for this long post & thanks again for your time.";2021-01-16 20:58:39;"I don't know how to read a backup, consider that they are originally encrypted. My suggestion is to manually export your chat history as .txt file. You can export specific chats tapping ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ in the chat on Android, and in Contact Info on iOS.

Can I ask why you want to delete WhatsApp? Are you worried about the changes introduced in new Terms of Service? I feel you, I was in a similar situation and then I followed a tutorial posted on XDA. Details can be found here. [https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kxc8d0/deleting\_whatsapp\_moving\_to\_signal\_or\_telegram/](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kxc8d0/deleting_whatsapp_moving_to_signal_or_telegram/) Thank you for your reply. I was thinking doing the same but then it will take very long  exporting individual chats. Also, I think one cannot transfer the media too using this option.

I'm deleting whatsapp partially due to its upcoming changes, but mainly because it's now owned by Facebook which I really hate & the people behind that organization. Also, whatsapp broke its own commitment of NOT sharing users data which I guess is really bad. Thank you for your reply. However, the link you shared is too complicated for me since I am really not a tech guy. This sounds lame but I know I will mess up with the settings. It‚Äôs been owned by facebook for years have you been able to move users over to signal."

Help me verify/bust the statement that WhatsApp/Facebook has access to links you sent via WhatsApp;1;kylb7j;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kylb7j/help_me_verifybust_the_statement_that/;0;"## Origin:

During the discussion between a group of friends one of them mentioned that WhatsApp/Facebook collects links sent/opened via WhatsApp. Now if this would be true than it would cut heavily into the idea of ""all messages you sent are E2E encrypted"" (minus metadata).

## Research:

Trying to verify this statement I searched the web, though most articles I found were only talking about the general issue at the moment of WhatsApp starting to share data with Facebook.

I did however come across a German podcast with one attendee saying that the WhatsApp privacy policy states that [links shared with WhatsApp are not E2E encrypted](https://youtu.be/s1nd0OOQR-I?t=585).

Looking through the WhatsApp privacy policy scattered over all its pages I found no information confirming the statement.

I also tried contacting the people behind the podcast but I'm still waiting for a response (it's Saturday after all)

### Some testing:

One hypothesis of mine was that in order to protect the users privacy from 3rd party services, any link previews generated in WhatsApp are done so via WhatsApp/Facebook servers, i.e. WhatsApp client sends the link to the server -> server connects to website specified by link to generate preview -> preview date gets sent back to client (client never connected to website specified behind link). To test this I entered the URL of one of my server into a WhatsApp chat message while checking traffic on the server using `tcpdump`. However the connection to my server came from my phone meaning the link preview was generated on the phone. So this hypothesis turned out to be *wrong*.

## Current state

Overall I'm still not sure if and how WhatsApp is supposed to collect links shared via their service. If anyone has more information or did manage to find the according section in their privacy policy please let me know.

I'm still actively looking for more information and will update the post if I find anything related.";2021-01-16 18:54:06;
Whatsapp-Facebook;239;kyl3fo;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/yntopeurspb61.jpg;16;;2021-01-16 18:42:10;"Shoes have nothing wrong. We all depend on them. There‚Äôs a lot of market and few people buy them compulsively. But if Facebook discovers that you visit clothing shops quite often, it will be keen on capitalizing on that profitable vulnerability. It doesn‚Äôt give a dollar if you need help. Fuck you, milking cow. 

I have heard of a couple of women who were addicted to buying clothes. 

To make things clearer, let‚Äôs suppose that Facebook  tracks you visiting alcohol selling websites, or WhatsApp discovers your interest on alcohol brands. 

It will have a very profitable vulnerability to capitalise. 

It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúhaving nothing to hide‚Äù. It‚Äôs about not giving them basic clues of vulnerability to  manipulate your behaviour and thoughts

You do not use WhatsApp, WhatsApp uses you This isn't correct though. WhatsApp won't let Facebook read your messages. What it will let Facebook know is your location, when you're online, who you talk to, etc. So then Facebook can serve ads based on where you are or, if you're online at night, ads for sleeping pills or some shit like that. Still bad, just in a different way. Yeah ... Thats not hoe it works We are being controlled in every aspect of our life‚Äôs , it it‚Äôs not WhatsApp and Facebook , google listen to every conversation you have through their microphones on their products, the amount I‚Äôve been talking to my daughter about a certain Xmas present then five mins later I‚Äôve got an advert for it on social media facebook and whatsapp is good souce to earn money from ads. you can also earn money from whatsapp group links
[whatsapp group link](https://adultwhatsappcollection.blogspot.com) They discovered I'm gonna leave their services lol I'm more worried about stuff like health insurance companies buying whatsapp data and discovering ""this person talks very frequently with this other person who we know is a doctor that specializes in this particular condition so we will put this person in the 'do not offer health insurance' because we can deduce from it that they have this pre-existing condition"". 

I can imagine A TON of different scenarios where politicians or corporations might be interested in who you interact with, when, where, how frequently, etc. did i smell communism in last line

you mean communism in capitalise company? Yes. They can also see the names of your chat groups.

Still, this will likely be a WhatsApp of the future, whereby they can read and share your messages. If they ever merge it with Messenger, it'll be interesting to see if they drop E2EE entirely. Those who use Facebook and Messenger don't care about privacy anyway, so... Gets worse than that.

Whatsapp has your phone number, congregated data to know for example: you‚Äôre terminally sick

They know you call your doc but they don‚Äôt know what you said. They know you were located at the hospital but rarely used your phone ( surgery), they know you called your lawyer, then your wife did, so that must be the family‚Äôs lawyer as you‚Äôre arranging to affairs. They know it‚Äôs not cancer, but AIDS cause you then called an HIV center for a follow up.

The truth is: they don‚Äôt need to read your convo.

Although, to add insult to the injury: when what‚Äôs back ups your data for you, they‚Äôre stored in clear. So no need for your current convos, yeah so of course they‚Äôd encrypted these Go on What did you see? The Chats you have with other people on WhatsApp are End to End Encrypted, as such WhatsApp ""only"" knows who you talk to and when you talk to them but not what. 
I dont want to say the policies of WhatsApp are good but they are definitely not as bad as portayed in most of the memes that circulate at the moment Agree. 

The only thing is if you contact shoe companies, and WhatsApp has asked specific permission to collect that data for futher processing. Thats a good point, you are right on that one. Not technically ""asking for permission."" You **have to** give them permissions if you're using their services. They could have had an opt-out option for data processing if they were ""asking for permission"""

WhatsApp usage in EU but with contacts outside EU;1;kyj7f1;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kyj7f1/whatsapp_usage_in_eu_but_with_contacts_outside_eu/;1;"Hello everyone,

As a result of the upcoming updates to WhatsApp's Privacy Policy, I'm asking for some help to better understand what happens when users in EU (under GDPR) have contacts outside EU.

As far as I know, the changes/updates to the Policy apply differently in between EU-based users and users outside EU with regards to what data and how much data (or metadata) WhatsApp can share with its parent Facebook company.

The use case I have in mind is as follows:

* I assume that if a user is based in EU, and all his/her contacts are also based in EU, then all communications, contacts, metadata, etc. of all parties involved are set according to what the GDPR allows. That means more constraints for WhatsApp to share data with Facebook.
* However, if a user is EU-based but also has contacts residing outside EU, even if the communication and contact metadata from the EU user is not share with Facebook, will similar or related data for the non-EU-based user be collected? If so, that would mean that in the end Facebook could also know that some person, let's say based in India or USA has contacted certain person in EU. So, in the end, the communications of the EU-based user are also somehow monitored and affected.

Is my understanding correct?

Many thanks in advance for your help!";2021-01-16 16:47:10;"gets even more complicated.

WhatsApp has removed the export function??;9;kyh0ut;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kyh0ut/whatsapp_has_removed_the_export_function/;16;"Like everyone else, I'm moving away from WhatsApp for Signal, and I want to export my chats. I've been following guides on the internet, and they all say to use the export button, but it's not there anymore! 

I definitely remember seeing it in the past though. WhatsApp are really becoming shady about this whole business!

Edit: fixed it now, see the comments";2021-01-16 14:01:26;"Are you from Germany? so did you see [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kxsipu/learn_how_to_export_your_data_out_of_whatsapp/) post from yesterday? by u/HyiueN

but you're right I can't find the export button anymore.... and there's the problem of line limit. Just downgraded the app to a version from November, and the button's back.

Such BS though. Hey guys, thanks /u/Temporariness for the mentioned.

I just checked and WhatsApp didn't officially roll out an update either on App Store nor the Google Play Store, but that doesn't mean they didn't in fact disable the export.

There are 2 methods to export your message history:

1. The one described here: [https://nomorewhatsapp.com/how-to-export-your-data-from-whatsapp](https://nomorewhatsapp.com/how-to-export-your-data-from-whatsapp)
2. You can also swipe left on a chat in your chat list and click on ""More"" (I'm testing on iOS, I don't have an android to see if it works the same)

Currently the export is working fine for me on iOS.

Can you try both and tell me if any is working? following... 

This is exactly what's been stopping me from moving. I just need an archive of everything cause I have so much valuable info and resources there...

btw, I heard it's impossible b/c it's encrypted... but aren't we the ones it's encrypted for? since it's our chats? shouldn't we have like an encryption key or smthn?

anyway, let's see what the more knowledgeable on this will say... I ain't getting any problems, I'm not in Europe and I'm fully updated.

&#x200B;

I'm in the beta channel tho, could be a factor I'm on Android 11, and whatsapp version 2.21.2.6 and my export button is located here:

Settings>Chats>Chat History and here I find the ""Chat Export"" button. Yes, why? 1. The export chat button literally wasn't there. But I downgraded to a version I found on apkpure, and it's back and works normally.

2. Swiping chats doesn't do anything on android. There is an encryption key and you can access it. But, for obvious safety reasons, it is very hard to get to if you are a standart user. Yes, is it hard to get the key for you. But it is also near impossible for intruders too. The next update ([iOS](https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-messenger-beta-for-ios-2-21-20-14-whats-new/) and [Android](https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-21-2-5-whats-new/)) will enable the possibility to export the chat history for German Users. How do I get this encryption key? I'm rooted if that helps. Why should it be any different for Germany though? If you are rooted, then it is easy peasy for you. Google ""WhatsApp encryption key"" and skip the rooting steps. It is in the root directory but I am not sure exactly where. There were some legal reasons and WhatsApp had to remove the feature there Cheers!

Edit: for those that are looking, the ""key"" file can be found in /data/user/0/com.whatsapp/files"

join our channel [whatsapp group links](https://t.me/joinwpgroups) [deleted] If you've been using WhatsApp recently, you'll notice that a screen appears asking you to agree to a new privacy policy that takes effect from February 8th. Quick TL;DR of the policy: WhatsApp can now **collect additional data** such as **call logs and contacts** to submit to Facebook, for **marketing purposes**. 

If you haven't agreed to the new policy, you'll be forced to make the decision when the policy is about to be enforced. **You can choose to agree to the policy and let Facebook profit off you, or delete your WhatsApp account.**

News of this spread around, and people are not happy with being forced to give up their data or lose complete contact with their family and friends in the pandemic. As of right now, many users are migrating to other messaging platforms, such as Telegram and Signal.

If you have accidentally agreed to the policy, it's not too late. You can delete your WhatsApp account by going to WhatsApp settings>Account>Delete my account and follow the steps. Reported to pta, and fia Worse than Whatsapp

2. Tell your peers that you are moving to Signal or any other app. Try and convince those who matter to you. 

3. Reduce damage: remove contact sharing privileges (this will prevent Facebook from upgrading your ‚Äúsocial graph‚Äù).  Minimise the usage of WhatsApp. Read messages and answer calling up if necessary. 

4. Once you have come of age and are independent from Facebook, close  your accounts. 

Sadly, You cannot ‚Äúdelete‚Äù your account. What has been stored is kept forever in their servers and might be used to further manipulate your behaviour Delete your account and delete the app and move over Signal Thanks everyone. Yes, I fully intend to delete the WhatsApp app. But I was seeing if before I do that, if I already screwed myself by clicking ""I Agree"" and my data will be shared/manipulated etc. no matter what because I already agreed, even after I delete the app.

Sounds like a ""no"", so I guess I'm screwed no matter what. Thanks. Yes, I'm definitely deleting the account. But since I already accepted, am I already screwed even after I delete it? Is there a way to see if you‚Äôve accepted it though? Thanks. Question on two of your points:

-------

The problem stemmed from WhatsApp‚Äôs ability to create new encryption keys for offline users. This is common for secure communication tools, but WhatsApp is set apart by its decision to re-encrypt messages with the new keys without informing their sender or recipient.

This could allow someone to intercept communications with no indication to anyone involved with the conversation. WhatsApp has therefore effectively undermined the basic principle of end-to-end encryption. Surveillance Capitalism As I read somewhere, saying nothing to hide is one part but do you handover your phone unlocked to some random person for him to look around? This whole thing seem similar to that. We have nothing to hide but share with Facebook companies and what they do with my data is unknown. So that unknown is what many are worried about. 

My friends says same. I have nothing to hide. But the problem lies elsewhere It‚Äôs not about hiding things. It‚Äôs about preventing Facebook from controlling your behaviour and thoughts. Look at ‚ÄúCambridge analytica‚Äù and the mass murders of the Rohiyingas in Myanmar.

\~

If you‚Äôre one of the two billion people who use Whatsapp, then you have probably noticed the new terms of service. You might already have accepted them. You might also have heard that these new terms of service consolidate and extend Whatsapp‚Äôs surveillance of your behaviour. You might be worried. 

I think you‚Äôre right to be.

This post is primarily focussed on Whatsapp and Facebook, but many of the observations apply equally to other tech corporations who profit from surveillance of our data, especially Google. This article is also pretty thorough and might take you a while to work through at 2,800 words. But it‚Äôs split into four parts so please feel free to skip around:

1. What do these new terms of service mean for you?
2. Understanding surveillance capitalism
3. Is there any hope? (UK and EU focus)
4. Four things you can do right now

Right, let‚Äôs go!

### What do these new terms of service mean for you?

There‚Äôs  been one hell of a stink about Whatsapp since the announcement that the  corporation will delete our accounts if we don‚Äôt accept these new terms  of service.

First, to avoid any confusion, there‚Äôs one thing that the new terms of service are *not*: Facebook *cannot* now exploit the *content* of your messages. They are still encrypted. Everything else about your usage of the app, however, is up for grabs.

Despite  this popular confusion, I think the great media stink has been very  useful because I don‚Äôt think any of us should be using Whatsapp‚Äîor any  Facebook product, for that matter. But I also think that we should  temper our shock‚Äînot because Whatsapp isn‚Äôt a stinking rotten app, but  because, since its acquisition by Facebook in 2014, it has *always* been a stinking rotten app.

[Forbes cybersecurity correspondent Zak Doffman puts it well](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/01/09/stop-using-whatsapp-after-facebook-apple-imessage-and-signal-privacy-backlash/):

>This  isn‚Äôt about WhatsApp sharing any more of your general data with  Facebook than it does already, this is about using your data and your  engagement with its platform to enable shopping and other business  services, to provide a platform where businesses can communicate with  you and sell to you, all for a price they will pay to WhatsApp.

What  the stink has usefully done is confront us with some important  questions that we must answer before moving on with our lives:

1. Do  you want the Facebook corporation scraping the metadata from your  Whatsapp messages to sell to their business partners who will then use  that data to reach you, your contacts and other people like you inside  Whatsapp?
2. In other words: are you happy to participate in the development of the Whatsapp marketplace, where *you* and your data are the commodity, sold by Facebook to third-party businesses?
3. Is that a fair price to pay for a service that offers ‚Äòfree‚Äô messaging? *HINT: No, it‚Äôs not. Not when actually free and secure alternative messaging services exist.*

This great stink has brought Whatsapp‚Äôs broken business model to broader public awareness, so let‚Äôs take a look.

### Understanding surveillance capitalism

Whatsapp  is part of the biggest surveillance operation the world has ever known:  the Facebook corporation collects more data about its users than even  the most dystopian science fiction writers ever imagined. The new  Whatsapp terms of service will permit the sharing of your metadata‚Äîthat  is data about your messages, but not the *content* of your messages‚Äîacross the Facebook corporation.

Don‚Äôt  fall into the trap of thinking that metadata is unimportant: your  device ID, your user ID, your contacts, your purchase history and  financial activity within Whatsapp and your location is more than enough  data to build a detailed consumer profile and connect you to *you‚Äî*even if you don‚Äôt subscribe to the open surveillance of a Facebook account.

The  change in the terms of service is to facilitate the encroachment of  third party businesses into your private messaging. It‚Äôs classic [surveillance capitalism](https://davidcharles.info/2015/01/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism/):  the Facebook corporation collects and sells your data for profit.  That‚Äôs why their apps are ‚Äòfree‚Äô; our data is their business model.

They‚Äôre  not alone, of course. Surveillance capitalism is a popular business  model for many tech companies, including other social networks like  Twitter and LinkedIn, but also Amazon, Apple and even Pok√©mon Go. But  only two corporations have the far-reaching scale of surveillance to use  our data to manipulate entire democracies: Facebook and Google. 

In  a group chat on Whatsapp, a friend asked whether as individuals we had  anything to fear from mass surveillance capitalism. Another friend  replied, saying:

>I guess it depends who makes the  laws? At the moment we‚Äôre not in much danger, but if we lived in Russia,  for example, and wrote an article critical of the government, we‚Äôd be  in more danger if our data wasn‚Äôt secure. And we do keep unexpectedly  electing dictator-y people‚Ä¶

I love that last  sentence. For decades our only defence against the dangers of mass  surveillance has been ‚ÄòYes, but that could never happen *here*!‚Äô I wonder how many people still believe that.

But  even if we stay relatively safe on an individual level, there is also a  much broader societal risk. As another friend in the group put it:

>At  a national level, there are implications for private companies knowing  more about a population than even the government, e.g. Facebook /  Cambridge Analytica / Brexit.

Starting in 2014, and with the complicity of the Facebook corporation, [Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of millions of Facebook users](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy) and analysed behavioural patterns in order to [find, target and ‚Äòinfect‚Äô the most susceptible demographics](https://www.businessinsider.com/cambridge-analytica-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-facebook-data-2019-10?r=US&IR=T) with a particular political ideology, and from there spread the contagion to the rest of the population. 

Cambridge  Analytica were used by both Donald Trump‚Äôs first presidential bid and  the Vote Leave campaign during the UK‚Äôs referendum on membership of the European Union in 2016. Both campaigns, you‚Äôll have noticed, were  successful‚Äîan odd word to use given the four years that have ensued.

If you‚Äôre anything like me, even as an individual, the unregulated interference into and destabilisation of our democracies is a huge price to pay.

*Side note: The aforementioned Whatsapp group, I‚Äôm pleased to report, has now migrated to the non-Facebook and genuinely secure messaging platform* [*Signal*](https://www.signal.org/)*‚Äîbut more on that later‚Ä¶*

### Is there any hope? (UK and EU focus)

That‚Äôs enough depressing content for now. The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal broke years ago‚Äîhasn‚Äôt anything changed? Isn‚Äôt there any hope on the horizon?

Well, not really, no. But there are three points that offer Whatsapp users not so much hope as *doubt* that could easily be *confused* with hope and keep us wedded to a fundamentally unwell platform.

Firstly, in the European Union, GDPR law means that, legally, Facebook aren‚Äôt  allowed to connect the dots between Whatsapp and the rest of the  corporation. Despite leaving the EU, the same GDPR regulations apply in  UK law‚Äîalthough the UK now has the independence to change those  regulations.

However, as a friend keen on digital privacy commented:

>Facebook will do what they want and pay the fine later. They are not on the side of good. IMHO.

In  2019, Facebook were ordered to pay a fine of $5 billion for privacy  violations after the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data breach. This  sounds like a lot of money, but [the fine was described by observers](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/12/facebook-fine-ftc-privacy-violations)  as ‚Äòa favour ‚Ä¶ a parking ticket‚Äô, ‚Äòa mosquito bite‚Äô and ‚Äòa Christmas  present five months early‚Äô. For scale, between 2016, when the worst  effects of the data breach took hold, and 2019, when the fine was  announced, Facebook increased their annual revenue by more than $43  billion.

Secondly, a terms of service update in 2016 gave existing  users an ‚Äòopt-out‚Äô from the automatic sharing of their Whatsapp  metadata with the rest of the Facebook corporation. Of course, this  doubt/hope is only relevant if you joined Whatsapp before 2016. If you  joined the corporation after 2016, then your metadata is already at the  mercy of Facebook‚Äôs rapacious appetite.

*Side bar: If you want  to find out whether you took advantage of this opt-out, then you‚Äôll need  to request your account information by going to Settings > Account  > Request account info. It takes a few days.*

Facebook have  said that they will continue to ‚Äòhonour‚Äô this 2016 opt-out. But what  does that mean? And can we trust Facebook to act on honour? Not if  history is any guide: in 2018, when GDPR law came into effect in the EU,  the corporation simply moved 1.5 billion non-EU Facebook accounts to  servers outside the new privacy law‚Äôs jurisdiction. Facebook aren‚Äôt the  only surveillance corporation to do this, by the way: LinkedIn did the  same.

Thirdly, on 8 December last year, the US Federal Trade  Commission and 46 of the US states launched an antitrust lawsuit arguing  that Facebook‚Äôs acquisition of Whatsapp and Instagram has created a  monopoly in social networking. The plaintiffs hope to force the Facebook  corporation to break up again into smaller companies. This, they say,  will be for the good of consumer choice‚Äînot, you‚Äôll note, for the good  of consumer privacy. The business model of selling our data is not under  threat.

But how long will that lawsuit take? And, even if it‚Äôs  successful, why would an independent Instagram and Whatsapp take any  less of a surveillance capitalist attitude to our data? If you want to  learn more about this lawsuit, [BBC Sounds Briefing Room](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000qmpz) has a 28 minute discussion of Facebook‚Äôs ‚Äòmonopoly problem‚Äô.

### Four things you can do now

I think that‚Äôs enough exploration of the terrain. What can we do right now?

#### 1. Delete Whatsapp, obviously

A lot of people, including me, have been trying alternative messaging apps recently. [Signal](https://www.signal.org/download/)  has been the primary beneficiary of the great Whatsapp stink, becoming  at times the second most downloaded app on the Apple App Store. 

Signal  is everything that we fooled ourselves into believing Whatsapp was: a  totally secure messaging app with no ifs, no buts. Signal has all the  features of Whatsapp‚Äîgroups, video calling, voice notes‚Äîwithout any of  the leaky surveillance data. 

Simply put: none of us need Whatsapp anymore and we should all leave today.

Of  course, it‚Äôs not as easy as that. A messaging app is only as good as  its user base‚Äîbut that‚Äôs exactly why we should all install Signal, even  if we continue to use Whatsapp during the transition.

I appreciate  that, for some people, deleting Whatsapp is akin to having a surgical  lobotomy and removing half a decade of memories. Luckily, we can save  these memories. There are two steps to archiving your entire Whatsapp  history:

1. Save all of your downloaded Whatsapp photos,  video and voice notes in one fell swoop by copying the Whatsapp Media  folder from your phone to your computer. (Yeah, I‚Äôm amazed how insecure  this is too!)
2. Export the text content of your messages by  going to Whatsapp Settings > Chats > Chat History > Export  Chat. There‚Äôs no need to download the media files again because you did  that in step one. However, because the text content *is* encrypted, you‚Äôll need to do this second step manually for each of the individual or group chats that you want to save. 

If you‚Äôre struggling with saving your message history, digital human rights organisation Witness wrote an excellent guide: [How to export content from WhatsApp](https://blog.witness.org/2018/12/export-content-whatsapp/).  If this process is too laborious for you, then all I can say is that I  appreciate it can be hard to let go, but that there is also beauty in  ephemera. Let it go.

I know that some people can‚Äôt be bothered to  run multiple messaging apps. If you find that your friends are split  across different platforms, like mine are, then [Documentally](https://documentally.substack.com/p/kakistocracy-255) recommends we embrace the diversity and ‚Äòlive in notifications‚Äô. 

What  does that mean? Typically, a message alert appears in your phone‚Äôs  notification bar and tapping on that alert will automatically open  whichever app the message came through. So it shouldn‚Äôt matter if you  have one messaging app or twenty-seven: you access the messages in the  same way, through notifications. 

*(BONUS: Using your phone in  this way should also reduce the number of times you open your apps ‚Äòjust  in case‚Äô someone‚Äôs messaged.)*

It‚Äôs worth saying here that,  if you have a Facebook or Instagram account, then I genuinely don‚Äôt know  how much you personally will gain from deleting Whatsapp alone.  Whatsapp‚Äôs metadata merely compounds the surveillance operation led by  those two other broad spectrum spying tools. 

However, by  installing Signal you will certainly be helping your friends who want to  divest from the Facebook corporation altogether. And we really  appreciate good neighbours!

#### 2. Use different web browsers for different surveillance corporations

This is what [security expert Rob Braxman calls ‚Äòbrowser isolation‚Äô](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z3_Em4S99g).  Surveillance corporations collect their data using your unique browser  fingerprint, so by using different browsers to isolate the various  surveillance corporations, we can restrict the reach of their spying  algorithms.

The two major surveillance corporations are Facebook  and Google, so for Braxman that would mean we need three different web  browsers:

1. Google Chrome for *nothing* except our  Google apps‚ÄîYoutube, Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive and so on.  (Incidentally, Braxman suggests using DuckDuckGo for search, rather than  Google.)
2. A completely different browser for *nothing* but  Facebook corporation apps‚ÄîFacebook, Instagram and Whatsapp. (Worth  saying: Braxman strongly advises deleting all your Facebook accounts!)
3. A third browser for *everything else*‚ÄîBraxman suggests a clean install of Firefox.

Note  that this protection only extends to desktop or laptop computers.  Mobile devices, including tablets, are more complicated‚Äînot least  because most Android devices are locked into Google‚Äôs surveillance  engine.

#### 3. Get a burner phone to run Whatsapp

Sadly, there  are more mobiles in the UK than there are people‚ÄîI‚Äôve got three phones  myself! Use that waste to your advantage: either you or a friend will  have an old smartphone or tablet knocking around.  Use that old  smartphone or tablet to run Whatsapp and Whatsapp only.

Here is  where I get a little out of my depth in terms of surveillance knowledge.  At the moment, I run Whatsapp on my old smartphone without a SIM card  installed. Day to day, I rarely carry my smartphone around‚Äîso how much  data am I leaking to Whatsapp? But I do also use the Whatsapp Web client  on my laptop‚Äîhow much data does that leak? I don‚Äôt know.

Safer  perhaps would be to get hold of a cheap SIM card and set up Whatsapp  with a dumbphone. Some dumbphones, like the Nokia 2723 or 8110, can even  run Whatsapp on the device. But with these you‚Äôll be restricted to the  hard-to-type keypad because there‚Äôs no way of scanning the QR code  needed to launch the Whatsapp Web client on your computer. 

You  could, however, use an Android emulator like Bluestacks to use Whatsapp  on your computer. It‚Äôs nowhere near as user friendly as the Whatsapp Web  client and, again, I don‚Äôt know how much data would leak from your  computer.

Is there a clever workaround involving putting your  burner SIM card into a smartphone, setting up Whatsapp Web, and then  transferring the burner SIM back to the dumbphone? Possibly, but I very  much doubt it because the Whatsapp Web client is only a mirror of the  Whatsapp app on your phone.

It‚Äôs worth saying that Whatsapp regularly drop support for older phones. At the moment, the app won‚Äôt work with iPhones 1-4 and Android phones released before 2010, for  example.

Again, these burner phone options are only really worth exploring if you don‚Äôt have a Facebook or Instagram account. If you have other Facebook corporation products, then Whatsapp is the least of your problems‚Äîthe tip of your data profit iceberg.

#### 4. Uninstall Whatsapp without deleting your account

This is what I did when I went on a long hike before Christmas. Four days of blissful radio silence. 

It‚Äôs a great option to test leaving the platform and I found it completely pain-free: 

1. Take a backup of your Whatsapp account: Settings > Chats > Chat Backup. You can store the backup either locally on your device or encrypted in the cloud using Google Drive.
2. Delete the app. 
3. Enjoy an indefinite period of surveillance-free life. 

If you want to advise people that you‚Äôre going offline, you can‚Äîor you can change your profile status to something helpful, like, I dunno, maybe: ‚ÄòOH MY GOD WE‚ÄôRE ALL BEING SPIED ON ALL THE TIME‚Äô.

When you‚Äôre ready to return, reinstall the app, restore the backup and you‚Äôre good to go. Let the surveillance resume!

A couple of warnings if you want to try this. I‚Äôm not a huge user of  Whatsapp, but after four days of absence I came back to 235 unread messages (although more than half of them were from one group). Also: an unknown number of messages sent during my offline period didn‚Äôt get delivered to me afterwards and I don‚Äôt know why. 

### See you on Signal :)

Phew‚Äîtold you this was long! If you have any questions or comments, please go ahead and reply. Like I said: I'm still learning too.

If you found this post helpful, I'd love you to check out [my weekly Substack newsletter](https://davidcharles.substack.com) for more stories that help you understand the world.";2021-01-15 20:27:03;"Its a social problem and it will be solved with a social action, not with individual ones. 

I will move to signal when everyone is there, which is the only reason I use WA. Dude, I cannot thank you enough, this saved me a lot of research and time, I still haven‚Äôt made my mind up tho, I‚Äôm between deleting my WhatsApp which would be very inconvenient but maybe necessary, or downloading signal and just using WhatsApp for group chats (Also, I already deleted Facebook and Ig), what do you think about the second option? Do you think it‚Äôs viable or do you think I should just delete WhatsApp? Anyways, regardless of the response, thanks a lot for the article, I hope it gets more traffic because it‚Äôs really useful and necessary right now. I found this article very interesting. However, can we be sure of really avoiding surveillance just by deleting whatsapp?? What about the others Apps? FB, IG Google? Even the fact of having a smartphone, makes us subject of a big social experiment. We are the product of their profit. Aaah! [Found you!](https://xkcd.com/1782/) But surely social change will only start when individuals stand up and make a personal choice too move.

When I downloaded telegram, I was pleasantly surprised to see a few of my contacts there already. Thank you so much!

Definitely download and start using Signal where you can - even if it only moves one or two chats away from Whatsapp for now. More people will switch if you give them the option :)

Not sure if you realise, but Signal can be used for Group chats as well - although obviously everyone needs to download Signal first. I've found that once a critical mass of people in the group switch (and tell others), the social pressure takes over and the rest of the group installs Signal.

The answer to using Whatsapp for group chats also depends on where you are based. If you're based in the UK or the EU (where GDPR law applies), then I think the risk is low - although I still think that we should be encouraging everyone to switch to Signal. If you're based outside of the UK, EU or anywhere else where there are decent-ish data privacy laws, then I'd personally feel pretty bad about staying with Whatsapp at all. 

But it's totally your call - and you've done the biggest favour to your data privacy by deleting Facebook and Instagram. Nice one! Delete WhatsApp and choose signal . Convert your group I did it ! You're absolutely right. In terms of surveillance, FB and IG should be the first to go. Then Google - not easy for Android users, but not impossible :) As mentioned in the article, personally I limit my exposure by using my smartphone without a SIM card. My main phone is a dumbphone, the Punkt M02. But I'm really interested in 'degoogling' my smartphone as well. Swap IRC for ""Telegram, signal, or parler"". Totally agree and I found exactly the same with my contacts on Signal. Yay! :D

You probably know this already, but in case you don't - encryption isn't turned on by default in Telegram. You have to enable it. True, but starting and finishing are two very different things. 

If I meet a stranger, 99.9% have whatsapp. Thanks, appreciate the response, I'll definitely try to convince the most people I can to migrate to Signal, but when it comes to big group chats, my hopes aren't too high that most of the people from the group chat will make the change, still worth the try tho, and I will try to use WhatsApp as little as I can, and if possible, delete it. But yeah again, great post, it was really helpful for me, and I will definitely share it with friends who have similar concerns. Also, maybe you should consider posting this on medium, maybe some more people will read it there We'll see what is the next WhatsApp move next may. Whatever people is doing is having an impact. Thanks for the tip - I'll do that! Posting here was a bit of an experiment as well so thank you for your feedback. Very encouraging! Good luck"
Care to explain me what's the difference between whatsapp collecting data since 6 years ago and the new update?;0;kxz32s;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kxz32s/care_to_explain_me_whats_the_difference_between/;4;[deleted];2021-01-15 20:21:04;"They can collect call logs, contact info and more. They can also sell the data collected to companies(if they aren't already doing so). Very little, but if we did not make a fuss 6 years ago, we might as well make a fuss today. 

I personally use WA because everyone uses it. I even discussed within my family unit using telegram and they refused to install extra apps: ""one is enough""... Exactly! I have gotten a few contacts to download Signal in the past, but not enough, so I have had to remain in WhatsApp to communicate effectively. With the current momentum it has been possible to overcome the inertia and I have now managed to switch whole groups form WhatsApp to Signal :-)  I think that this is the kind of push that is needed to switch platform, because we need a lot of people to switch at once. In economics we call it a natural monopoly.

We do not need ""a lot of people"", we need EVERYONE...

It contains info about my phone and such. That's fine. Then it contains the names of the WhatsApp groups I'm a member of and a list of the phone numbers of my contacts.

And that's it! That's what took them five days to collect. 

I can't believe that WhatsApp does not have data on whom I contacted when. That is all personal information according to the GDPR. What's up with this?";2021-01-15 19:57:00;"WhatsApp doesn't keep information about who you've contacted or when. You can believe it or not believe it, but it's true Fun fact.

Spotify's data is also the same. The problem is when the user who  requested it pushed further, 'is that all you got for me?'.

Took some back and forth email but finally Spotify sent him hundred of megabytes of data, all filled with his interaction with the apps and when he's online and what device he uses, including the type of headset.

Do not believe what WhatsApp sent to you plainly. Wow you mean the privacy policy fiasco is completely overblown and misreported?! Wow What if you are not in Europe? [deleted] You can trust Zuckerberg, although he lied to the congress of his own country. 

It‚Äôs true, Facebook is not a shady corporation

https://yewtu.be/watch?v=OjPYmEZxACM

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OjPYmEZxACM Hmm interesting, I‚Äôve gotta try this The type of data they collect now and after Feb 8 will be different. After the new privacy policy takes effect they can access more things like call logs and contacts. Try requesting a GDPR report then (if you'd like to supply your data to the monopolist Facebook) Haha. Exactly. Whatsapp already outline that the new privacy rule isnt apply at EU n UK(?) The burden of proof is on you to show that they're lying. If you think a company of 50,000 people (many of whom have quit in anger over the past few years) can keep a secret like that, you've lost your mind I see you've read through the ToS extensively. Thanks for your comment Zuckerberg does not abide by any laws, ethical nor written Incorrect. You clearly didn't read the update UK is still Europe so it doesn't apply as their GDPR laws mirror the European Unions, however there are fears UK will start weakening privacy laws in the future (I wont be surprised if they do). brexit! [deleted] Even so, reading the TOS won't be completely useful. Facebook can still collect data not stated in the TOS and get off the hook with a fine. They no longer care if they get sued, because they know they will profit more from the data they get off of us. I'd be surprised if they didn't. Your explanation of why it's easy for a company to hide a massive secret is the most famous example of a corporate secret being leaked in recent history? Cool.

Listen. WhatsApp alone has over 1,000 people working on it and the ads team has literally over 10,000 people. None of whom have any financial incentive to keep the company's secrets after they quit or are fired.

Even if your tinfoil hat theory were correct, it wouldn't do a damn thing to Facebook's bottom line. Remember #deletefacebook? The VW scandal? The 737 max fiasco? Google and the military projects? The Amazon workers rights conditions?

There's no grand conspiracy. Get over yourself [deleted] Far be it for me to argue with a Wikipedia article based on information from 2015.

There are login ID, password, keycodes, addresses people sent me, they aren't garbage There are few messages of my crush tho. Ah yes, thoughtful messages, memories, joyous conversations. Such garbage. Fucking burn it. Fair enough. 

I make huge efforts in not being a hoarder in my digital life. I have a Google Drive account with all the info I want to keep private from my partner, i.e. my previous girl friends.

Facebook data: they share data. Ur phone number will decide whether facebook is allowed to collect data (EU numbers are safe even if they are out of the EU. EU citizens are covered even if they are out of the EU). If ur number is not an EU number, it collects ur IP address among the other data that it collects. IP address can give ur approximate location even if it is not as accurate as GPS Thanks for making it clear! Is a British number still considered safe? I'm not sure cuz of brexit In theory, yes.

Has anyone else experienced this?";2021-01-15 10:43:46;"This does not happen at my side.
I suppose it's an iOS bug. Nah it says whatsapp doesnt have access to photos for me When choosing a profile picture, your system is the one that sees all your profile photos, not the app. The app is using the operating system to select the photo. And why is this done differently as compared to selecting a photo to be sent in a message? Your system browses through your storage much more efficiently than WhatsApp. That is fine. What is meant was that why does the WhatsApp app implement 2 different methods to access photos (asking iOS to grab the photo for profile picture versus trying to access the photo library directly when sending photos in messages.)?"

Its a bit annoying as whatsapp can't delete people without blocking them and deleting people on the fly like that isn't my thing.

Facebook‚Äôs challenges with managing WhatsApp are not new or unknown.  Ever since acquiring the popular chatting app for $19 billion, the  social network has been facing a challenge of monetization: How to make  money through WhatsApp.

  
This acquisition was costly, and despite growing the user-base by  over four times, the company has not been able to figure out a way to  make money out of it.

Securing Whatsapp;4;kxmnt9;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kxmnt9/securing_whatsapp/;23;"Hi,

I am helping my mom with securing whatsapp. What are the attack scenarios. What I have done so far:

1. Make her profile visible only to her contacts. This was obvious.
2. Changed it so only people on her contact can add her to groups. I have no idea what groups are for. She does not appear to belong to a group.
3. Turn off auto-downloading of media. I recall there were attacks that occur if you auto-open images and movies.
4. Should I turn off her backup? Why does she have 16Gb of whatspp data? In any case, is the backup encrypted?
5. I thought of turning on 2fa, but then she get confused and call me. 

How would you hack Whatsapp?

1. What if someone attempts to install Whatsapp and then use her number? This would result in a SMS text to her phone to be verified? Even if they hack SMS, they can't get to her message, but if she has google backup, they would be able to get message from google drive?
2. Are there hacks that work though the web app?
3. How are recovery done and how would you protect against hack using the recovery?

Paul";2021-01-15 07:09:36;"
> Should I turn off her backup? 

If it's 16 Gb, that might be a good idea, the cloud backup is only a diff backup for media, so it's not bad to leave it on if she has a lot of history that she'll want to keep if/when she gets a new phone (it's possible to move history to a new phone without cloud backup, it's just not  easy)

> Why does she have 16Gb of whatspp data? 

That's quite a large backup, you could probably use the new storage page (in settings) to find and delete some larger media she's received, disabling auto download will help keep her from getting back to having such a large backup.

> In any case, is the backup encrypted?

Yes, the backup is encrypted. It's not end to end since there's only one end, but it's encrypted with a key that's stored on WhatsApp servers for her account. WhatsApp has the key, the cloud service (google for android, icloud for iOS) has the data, so neither side can get the backups without having both parts. The cloud part is protected by your cloud password, the WhatsApp part is protected by the SMS registration process.

> I thought of turning on 2fa, but then she get confused and call me. 

WhatsApp's 2 factor is actually the reverse of your typical 2 factor: in a typical 2 factor, you would have your password (something you know) and your phone number (something you have), WhatsApp's regular registration uses your phone number and sends you the code, you turn on WhatsApp 2 factor to ""add a password"" to your account.

It can act as an extra layer of security from her getting ""hacked"" by someone tricking her into giving them her SMS registration code.

> How would you hack Whatsapp?
> What if someone attempts to install Whatsapp and then use her number? This would result in a SMS text to her phone to be verified? 

Exactly, anyone can initiate a registration attempt for her phone number, but they'd need the code that's sent to her SMS in order to actually register. If you turn on 2 factor, they'd need her to give them both the SMS code and the 2 factor code.

> Even if they hack SMS, they can't get to her message, but if she has google backup, they would be able to get message from google drive?

Correct, again, WhatsApp has the key, but the cloud service has the data. Someone would need her google password and her SMS registration code in order to get her messages (or the reg code and a copy of her encrypted databases)

> Are there hacks that work though the web app?

While using the web client from whatsapp.com should be fairly safe, malicious browser extensions *could* be problematic. Windows PCs are also fairly susceptible to allowing less informed users download malicious software that *could* be problematic.

I emphasize *could* because it's probably unlikely, but it's definitely a possibility. Basic tech hygiene (don't install malicious software) will go a long way. 

Android alone (assuming the phone isn't rooted and she has installed the official client) is much less likely to be compromised (basically would require physical access to the device or a screen recorder constantly running to have any real problems).

As long as she doesn't go scanning random QR codes using the web QR scanner in WhatsApp or installing weird programs or browser extensions, she should be safe.

> How are recovery done and how would you protect against hack using the recovery?

I think I covered this above: don't give your SMS code to people, don't give your google password to people (and don't use the same password for google as for other sites/services), and maybe turn on 2 fac (and don't give out the 2 fac code), and she should be fine. Who in their right mind is going to want to hack your mother... !!!??? 

The best security is not using it. George Bush Jr did not know what a Blackberry was until he left office. switch to Telegram or Signal, problem solved. Use any other agnostic, E2EE, Open Sourced messenger. Eg:  Signal, Telegram (only partially open sourced) etc. 
WhatsApp is owned by Facebook and they‚Äôve changed the privacy policy in WhatsApp. Agree to share your data with Facebook and it‚Äôs 3rd party affiliates or don‚Äôt use WhatsApp. That‚Äôs their policy. Effective February 2021. 
And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a secret how bad FB is, and has been with user data. Anything that you do here is useless. That just changes visibility to people, NOT FACEBOOK. No matter what settings u toggle, FACEBOOK WILL STILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT DATA. Best choice, move to signal. Thank you for the insightful post and taking the time to write. I believe you covered most or all of my questions, but I have some follow up questions.

In the case of backing up the whatsapp, the key is stored on the server, so if an attacker the phone number and the SMS, then they would be able to get the message? Do you know of ways to get access to SMS? I was thinking that it's possible to port a phone number by calling the carrier, so I added a pin code to her cell account. Another point of attack may be to steal her phone and then move her SMS to another phone. I have disabled SMS on her account because frankly she doesn't know how to use it and is full of spam. All sms is effectively blocked until I re-enable it.

When  you say give out SMS, you mean an attacker will trigger the SMS, and then contact my mom as a sibling or friend and ask her to provide the SMS message?

Thanks! Hackers are like wolves, they attack the weak. If you leave your system wide open, someone will hack it. Worrying about security is good preventive measure. Who do you think mom will call after a security incident?

Telling someone not to do something and expect them to not to do it is unrealistic, especially if it's your parent. Besides Whatapps does enrich her life by allowing her to chat with her sibling all across the world, so so some loss of privacy is acceptable to her. I am also not going to campaign for get all of my aunts and uncle to use signal. They are all non-tech and as stubborn as mom. This is a question about security not privacy. Switching to Telegram or Signal does not resolve the security issue. I am well aware of Whatapp's issue. This post is not for me. This is regarding security not privacy. Keep in mind that this is for my mom and not myself. I use signal and have suggested that my mom do so, but she does not want to because all her sibling uses whatsapp. I have listed out all of the downside and she still wants to use whatsapp, so I am just trying to help secure whatever app she wants to use. I do not dictate what another person wants to use. Yes, the steps you've taken should make it pretty hard for someone to get her registration code (sounds like it'd even be complicated for her to get her code now...)

You are correct in your assumption of the common attack pattern. Another way that people try to get the SMS code is by claiming they're WhatsApp and need her to give them her code. The only place you should ever use the SMS registration code is in the WhatsApp app during registration. > Telling someone not to do something and expect them to not to do it is unrealistic, especially if it's your parent. 

I guess it's what ""growing up"" is all about. 

Security in my books is about MONEY. The information to access my bank accounts is only in my memory.

I do not see what risks you can have with WhatsApp, other than not working. Fair enough. I'm convincing people to move away from whatsapp. Hopefully everyone does. For security, ig the steps u have taken are fine I doubt his mother is going to want to use WhatsApp after all that...

Poor woman is going to be scared to touch anything... XD Complicated for her, but not for me. She does not setup anything. If whatapps breaks, I or another sibling will get a call.

Thanks for your help! >factor

Thanks, I found another 2FA in the settings. When enabled. it will prompt for a 6 digit pin code that must be entered to add whatsapp to a device. Because the code can be forgotten, you also have to enable a recovery email in the event that you failed to remember the code. The 6 digit code isn't sent out via SMS.

I activated it but it said that it will periodically prompt for it. Unfortunately, this mean I will get a call every time that happens, so I disabled it. In addition, I don't think shifting the recovery from SMS to email helps unless the email is protected by a hardware key. Whenever my mom gets a letter, whether it's from IRS, insurance, bank. She uses the whatsapp  to take a picture of the doc and send it to the kids to help her understand what they are saying. This is a big security risk if someone gains access to the whatsapp contents. Thanks, 

She does have signal as her ""SMS"" client. and I have deleted my whatsapp account. If she wants to communicate with me, she will have to use signal to do it. I had to make this move because she like to send me forms and document using whatsapp. Even though facebook say that they can't read whatsapp messages, I am not sure entirely convince that they are not doing it somehow with AI. Most of her tech are setup by her and my siblings. She does not know that all of her stuff is being cloud backed up. She does not know security measures are taken in the background on her behalf. She does install anything because she does not know how to. She treats the phone and her computer as a turnkey device where everything is set up for her.

All of this is also to reduce the number of calls to her kids for tech support. One of us may be coordinating with 10 other people on an issue, operating on someone, etc, but mom will want us to drop everything because she can't whatapps with her siblings. >I activated it but it said that it will periodically prompt for it.

I have this setup and I am a bit surprised at how infrequently I get prompted for the PIN. True, but there are far more security risks that we are unaware of because they are rarely exploited, digital and analogue. 

I'd say that 419's are having a blast calling people posed as IT consumer service... Jim Brownings channel is epic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le71yVPh4uk Yea, soon they will be able to read cuz of a feature that they are gonna introduce Good on you! 

My mother has an iPhone, with my blessings, so that she cannot ask me for support. He he he he

In my case, the problem is that she falls for every viral trolling, along with her groups of republican friends, and forwards them to me... 

For years at a time all that she would forward was false... And she does not give a fuck... And she was a teacher."

We between apps because some rather use WhatsApp although I posted about their policy and saying I‚Äôm migrating to Tele but they still message me on WhatsApp. I think I‚Äôll just stop answering messages from WhatsApp. When people and group had moved, it would be hard to move back. People will just keep WhatsApp since business sites are still using it and old family members are still on it. But it is definitely dying as the move had started.

* iMessage is not viable for any Android user. IF you care about being in contact with Android users, iMessage is instantly out of the picture.
* Telegram might seem good, but it doesn't automatically encrypt your messages. As we consider switching due to privacy, it *isn't quite the best.*
* Signal encrypts messages automatically. However, Signal isn't yet developed as far as some other options, making it seem less viable. In exchange, the full source code of Client AND server is openly visible, offering no room for backdoors.
* Viber does say thay encrypt by default, yet their source code isn't visible to the public. They seem to do the bare minimum for security, are thus not 100% trustable.
* Threema is, just as Signal, open source and developed by a swiss company that has to comply HARSH data security laws. It's just recently been released as an open source product as well, but just the client. In order to add additional encryption, two people can scan each others QR codes to add an extra layer of encryption security. It's developed well but has a one time fee, which probably keeps some from getting it.
* Discord is owned by the chinese tech giant tencent and thus basically a joke. Use it for bantering on random servers and leave it be otherwise.

In total, this brings us to the following ranking:

Signal - Threema - Telegram - Viber - iMessage - Discord.

iMessage is far down due to accessiblity. Threema barely loses out to Signal because of Signals high transparecy. Telegram wins to Viber because you can use it without a SIM card.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading my TED suggestion. I'm no expert. But hey these are IMO good corner points. Correct me if I'm straight up wrong somewhere. Signal or Threema. The rest is just changing facebook for apple i.e.

But not telegram!: Telegram is NOT EVEN END TO END ENCRYPTED! THEY CAN READ YOUR MESSANGES! And they clearly state in their Terms they WILL save your messages for UP TO 1 MONTH!

No seriously.

I personally like Threema more than signal but that‚Äòs just taste. I made a post in r/privacy today where i asked the rest of reddit what they like more, check it out via my profile if you‚Äòre interested. But essentially: they‚Äòre both fantastically secure and it‚Äòs about your personal taste. Threema more polished, signal a bit securer. Just in case you‚Äòve got your own department at the CIA trying to read your messanges. Threema has Polls, signal has group calls, stickers and buildt-in gifs. Support threema not signal if you choose to switch I wish there was a way to also vote negatives here Wire. You will find me in none of the above. DONT FUCKING USE BIP, ITS JUST A SCAM WITH WORSE ToS THEN WP AND TELEGRAM. WTF IS A MUSLIM APP, DUMB SHEEP! ITS BASICALLY MIDDLE EASTERN WECHAT. Threema is the best by far Switch to Threema.

Signal may be comped. Their cryptographers and funding have ties to the Pentagon/Feds. No mention of XMPP or Matrix?! I use Threema and Signal, but I prefer Threema. It‚Äôs just less known in the USA and it‚Äôs not free... people gravitate towards free. Discord is a different platform. Discord is more comprehensive platform than Signal and Telegram. Telegram ftw üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ 

17?? My god people telegram is NOT secure

Only use signal ! Although I use iMessage the most, I still have Signal and Telegram installed. My main group chat recently migrated to Signal. Problem is, I use iMessage on my phone but I also use Windows computers (Excel SUCKS on a Mac). Finally, someone said it! But it's a good compromise of everything and is the most feature rich messaging platform. Even ICQ is better! good bot Lol no definitely not!

Signal = Threema > imessage > viber > discord > Telegram Brair: not on iOS

Session: no multi-device support

Signal: non-profit foundation

TG: (highly limited) e2e encryption.

Also: check [Secure Messaging Apps](https://www.securemessagingapps.com) I mean I don't disagree with you from a technical perspective, but... getting any sort of mainstream adoption of anything other than Signal or Telegram doesn't look promising from where I'm standing.

Briar's model is awesome in theory but I'm probably the only person within 50 miles with it installed.

A messaging app which only one person uses is perfectly secure because no data is at risk... Though zero users is even more secure! Briar seems partly similar to Tox, Cabal and Berty. Berty is based on ipfs which makes it a tad more interesting, it's not released yet though.  


The problem with the p2p in 2021 is that generally it requires more bandwidth and on mobile drains your battery faster. Also there is the problem of asynchronous delivery on 1on1 messages, but there seems to be solutions to this one already implemented in some of these messengers. XMPP and Matrix > Briar, for the mainstream masses. XMPP: Open protocol, E2EE encryption (most servers/clients already have it), no phone number or email required, metadata protection, decentralized, lots of apps you can choose from (and even on very old devices) What do you think of [BBM Enterprise ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/bbm-enterprise-bbme)? I have doubts with everything hosted in the US. We already know that companies will go down in flames when the hidden courts decide to enforce the backdoor-laws (remember Lavabit?)

And I am not sure how sustainable Signal with their financing really is.. the ex-owner of Whatsapp, who sold the App to facebook, stands behind it. Not sure how to feel about that.

Also I would disagree about Telegram, if you believe this list: [https://www.securemessagingapps.com/](https://www.securemessagingapps.com/)

But for a start yeah, I mostly agree with you. I'd say everything better than Whatsapp should be considered and why not use multiple of the best apps? I do it already for some years and have no issue with it.

BTW something barely know in the english-speaking space about Threema:

Threema is also used by the swiss government for confidential stuff (not the highest but the highest security level achievable by an external messaging app) and IMO the most sustainable app, since it is financed via Threema and ThreemaWork: [https://twitter.com/threemaapp/status/1095675070922534912](https://twitter.com/threemaapp/status/1095675070922534912) Telegram isn't using end-to-end encryption by default (only secret chats are encrypted), and they have NO option to enable end-to-end encryption on group chats. Furthermore, they use their own cryptography implementation which hasn't been audited or opensourced, making it far less transparent. Honestly, Whatsapp is the better option than Telegram, and that's saying a lot.

The application that is actually an improvement over Whatsapp (and a big one at that!) is Signal. Please do yourself a favor, and go with Signal. Getting people to ditch Whatsapp is already incredibly hard, but people then splitting over Signal/Telegram is making it even harder. Signal is probably better than Telegram and Discord because it's end-to-end encrypted, but Signal is still centeralised and they can practically choose to do just the same. I just hope somehow people will switch to Tox or BRIAR... (I'm not optimistic about that) Only idiots say Telegram is secure, like people on /r/Telegram. I prefer iMessage over any other messenger, but people in my country aren‚Äôt really fond of it. They use WhatsApp. So I have WhatsApp, Signal and iMessage till February Same iMessage is not secure by default. Telegram isn‚Äôt secure I have to disagree. You are giving up too much on the privacy/security front for sure. Even WhatsApp does a better job here than Telegram.

^(Even if I don't reply to your comment, I'm still listening for votes. Check the webpage to see if your vote registered!) Lol Signal and Threema are not equal Session previously had multi device support  but they removed due to some technical reasons, I just learned it is slated to return back in 2 weeks. >Signal: non-profit foundation

With Brian Acton behind it.. the guy who sold Whatsapp to facebook and it is hosted in the US (hello hidden courts and backdoor-laws)

Sadly, everything hosted in the US stands in very critical light

No doubt it is better than Whatsapp. But against Threema or Wire (according to your link), it seems to be less secure. But I would say.. go parallel. Use all three of them and try to get as many people as possible to a more secure app. 50 miles is 80.47 km I agree, Signal/Telegram are the only viable solutions as of now.
Two things suck about apps like briar ,session etc. are lack of features and low user adoption. Hopefully they will catch up soon as the big techs are making users more aware of privacy concerns. I use threema myself for those reasons, sadly one one single person of my complete circle uses it as well. It's the most well developed of all the alternatives imo with great privacy features. But you know as it is, people can buy 1200‚Ç¨ smartphones but won't have a damn dime to buy an app. I'd prefer using a messenger that charges ~20‚Ç¨ yearly than free ones because that way I know that they are sustainable without the need to get tbeir money through fishy transactions. Let's hope the donation model works for signal. I myself am definitely ready to donate small sums every now and then. Telegram's protocol is open sourced and documented [https://core.telegram.org/mtproto](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) Why should they do this?
The whole point of the non profit Signal Foundation is to bring privacy to people?
They also founded the foundation with rules that have to be followed...
Probably [read](https://signalfoundation.org/) about them. XMPP or Matrix. I will gladly change to briar

If you give me a IOS version

But seriously anyone know if there are any plans for a briar on IOS? Like, cant they just pull the same privacy funds like signal? So true! Telegram is actually worse than whatsapp. They aren‚Äòt end to end encrypted unless in secretchat and never in group chat. Means they can read your messages. And they c√∂early state in their terms they WILL store your messages for up to 1 month. Signal or Threema are my advice. How so? Lol nope they are. I just made a pist on r/privacy because i couldn‚Äòt decide which one to use as my main and the results were 50/50 mixed. They are both brilliant, it‚Äòs taste which one you should take. Threema is a bit more polished and has polls, signal has group calls Let‚Äôs see what are the conditions for it once they do roll it out üôÇ While I do share your hope, I also doubt that Briar or Session will get any further than relatively niche things for privacy nerds.

Of those currently available, I think Threema is the best compromise: no phone number is needed, but you can add one (I did because I don't feel the need for complete anonymity), E2EE with no metadata stored on the servers, great user interface, and the fact that you pay for your licence ensures that the business is more sustainable, you're the client and not the merchandise.

I know very few other people that use it though. Unfortunately the general public is so used to freebies that no one is willing to shell out the astronomical sum of $3 to buy Threema.

So I usually recommend Signal for the cheapskates as the next best thing. Well, WhatsApp was privacy-oriented at first too, and you know what happened to it. Signal is much better than WhatsApp, it's open source, it has reproducible builds, more options and stricter privacy policies and interests. However, there is no way to actually know what they're doing in their servers over their---it's technically possible (but I don't believe in that) that Signal is just an ""honeypot"" set by some government, and they still do know when and to whom you send a message. Signal is much better than WhatsApp, but it can compete with P2P. I don't think they have plans to create an IOS version. (Of course you can pull the trigger yourself and begin the development yourself (BRIAR is FOSS) and they'll probably help you) I never mentioned telegram, because I know that https://twitter.com/noahsbwilliams/status/1349631407153242123?s=19

Messages are end to end encrypted, but the encryption key is backed up into iCloud... next to the encrypted messages. Lol nope. Look at the above poll. 451 for Signal. 55 for Threema. When was WhatsApp ever privacy oriented?
Well as explained they had prepared several steps to ensure that Signal stay as it is. For example Signal can‚Äôt be sold. I guess that other rules are defined to prevent them to go a less privacy oriented way. 

And I guess that Edward Snowden is trusting in their service is a pretty solid argument?

Well the rest of your post sounds kind of crude to me.
The protocol used in Signal is audited several times the software as well! The protocol prevents man in the middle attack on server side I don‚Äôt think any government would benefit. Signal uses sealed sender. Server doesn't know who sent the message. It just knows a token of to whom it needs to send the message. Sender's certificate is inside the end-to-end encrypted packet. And if sender's certificates matches, inly then message would be decrypted.

See signal's website. Sealed sender Wait no wait what? Did i click on the wrong comment? Wtf happened here?

I‚Äòm sorry it was 2:30 am But isn‚Äôt iCloud also encrypted? The above poll shouldn't be used as a definitive argument for which app is better.

Threema, although currently less popular, had a much better featureset, as well as a more privacy-oriented design (with the implementation of the ""randomly generated"" threema IDs and subsequent ID trust levels.  In addition, Threema is held to the GDPR standard, and has no legal requirement to store data (CLOUD Act).  Not to mention, any request from good old Uncle Sam can be blatantly ignored, as they are based in Switzerland.  Both use E2E.  The popularity of signal is due to nothing other than elon musk saying so, and the fanboys jumping ship to follow what he says.

As a CSE major, both are pretty similar, but the more rich featureset definitely pushes threema above signal.

I also enjoy their ridiculous (yet genius and hilarious) marketing video depicting the average teen with their ""I'm not paying for a messaging app"" attitude.

I prefer to pay for apps with my money, and I would say that since signal is free, I'm a tad bit skeptical.


EDIT: I forgot to mention, I used to use signal back in 2016ish, and I really didn't like how they continued to ask to be your default SMS app.  I like having my encrypted stuff completely separate (like the 2 presidential phones in the oval office). That way there is no question as to if my messages are being encrypted.  As I have used both, my opinion isn't being skewed due to lack of use. > I don‚Äôt think any government would benefit.

Neither do I

> And I guess that Edward Snowden is trusting in their service is a pretty solid argument?

It is.

> Well the rest of your post sounds kind of crude to me. The protocol used in Signal is audited several times the software as well! The protocol prevents man in the middle attack on server side I don‚Äôt think any government would benefit.
The protocol is good, it's probably also better audited than BRIAR's or Tox'es. However it's their technical ability to know to whom I talk and correlate this data, thus they are still not 100% trustworthy (a lot of people stating that they trust Signal might make them more trusted, but not more trustworthy).

BTW, I do pretty-much trust Signal and I use Signal myself. Actually I read it just a few hours ago, I forgot about it... Well then, I believe I can simply onion route Signal and call it pretty trustworthy (neither onion routing is 100% trustworthy---with enough resources an agency can technically combine data and dis-anonymize onion routing).
In my case, doing this will require combining NetGuard with Orbot somehow, which I'm not going to do Yes you did üòÇ. But I figured it out No: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive/exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT You haven‚Äôt used a product in 4+ years and are giving a review of it in 2021. Actually server doesnt know who sent the message, to be delivered. See Sealed Sender on siganal's I have picked it back up recently, but my point was that I've used it long before any of the hype, and my gripes stand One of your gripes was that Signal only got popular due to Elon but it‚Äôs always had way more users than Threema. If popularity was important to you then just use Telegram. The popularity was not a gripe.  The point of bringing up popularity is because you were trying to use the poll (a measurement of popularity) as a definitive argument for which app was better. The other user brought up a ‚Äúpoll‚Äù before me where like seven people replied and tried to use that as an argument that they were equal. That was in response to that. They brought up ""polls"" as in, a feature in the app.  You can create polls in group chats.

Something in signal that you can't.


Anyway, I think you're misconstruing my argument.

I don't *hate* signal.   I think it's a good app.  I don't think it's great, but it's definitely a good stepping stone. They made a post asking which was better and used that as a ‚Äúpoll‚Äù to show they were basically even. 

https://i.imgur.com/296K5q0.jpg

Then I pointed out how ridiculous using reddit or social media is to say X or Y is better by saying scroll up and look at this poll where Signal is blowing them away. That‚Äôs where he basically stopped commenting and you picked up the conversation in a more serious light. I wasn‚Äôt doing that."
Deleting WhatsApp?

I know a lot of you will ask will be able to view my images, videos and others once I backup the chats, well the answer is \~yes. The WhatsApp Viewer when launched shows your messages and where there is a media file, if an image it shows the thumbnail and gives a location address of where that images is located in your whatsApp folder (the one I backed up earlier, remember?).

1. You will soon be able to use WhatsApp on PC even if ur phone is offline
2. FB is planning to integrate WhatsApp with fb messenger and instragram direct, so that, u will soon be able to message each other from either of these platforms. Instagram Direct and FB messenger are already merged.

All this requires ur messages to be stored on the cloud. Remember that WhatsApp messages which are stored are not encrypted. Only messages which are being sent are encrypted. Once it reaches the person, the message is decrypted and stored as plain text in a local db file. This is why, if a law enforcement agency gets their hand on a person's phone, even if whatsapp is uninstalled, they can get the messages.   


So now, when this integration happens, all of our messages must be stored on the cloud which will ultimately give access to all our messages Go to signal!!!!"

\- Option to delete chat and also delete records on the other side. (Not sure if Signal has it) When you delete any message (with your friends or in a group) it seems like delete everywhere.

Of course, this has downside. We have to rely on Telegram's server side encryption etc. But at least I think Telegram is better than WhatsApp. Bahaha, nice try FBI [deleted] Signal doesn't have cloud sync both of them have their uses. while i appreciate the very strong emphasis in security on Signal, I want to also be able to seamlessly switch from desktop to mobile and continue a conversation. that is something that's not supported on signal, at least for now. Telegram is not E2E by default but it can be if you need it. 

Another problem is that Signal is very finicky with the way you registered your contacts on your contacts list... If you didn't use the full international number, signal will not pick them up. most ""non-techie"" people in my country register their contacts with just the area code and that means they can't see their contacts on signal and don't understand the reason. Telegram seems to work just fine with that.

I simply downloaded both... we'll see what happens. but how is it better than whatsapp Where are you from? **cloud sync, signal doesn't have.**

* (Correct me is I am wrong) Telegram was audited a while ago but I don't think WhatsApp ever done that. 
* Self-destructing message is a useful feature
* Cloud Sync / Seamlessly sync between devices is a useful feature. But, of course you can argue that's a drawback for security

I do agree Signal is the best, I use Signal as well in some cases. 

I used WhatsApp before and now trying to switch to Signal and Telegram. In comparison with whatsapp it's more secure, maybe not signal level of security. And in comparison with both a lot more feature rich. WhatsApp is not as seamless between devices. WhatsApp is dependent on the mobile phone.
Migrating across devices is easier on telegram . Group size, etc

Or as the OP just said. yes but the conversations stay on the device. I have downloaded the desktop app and linked it to my phone. the chats stay only on the device you sent the message with or received it. they are not shared... so you cannot start a conversation on your desktop and then walk away and continue with your mobile. all the previous messages stay on the previous device. that's what I mean. > convenience with apps like Hangouts and Messenger

If this is convenience, I choose death. Neither of these can compete with Telegram in terms of convenience and features. I won't discuss the security level, but saying signal have more features than telegram is nonsense. Lol, Signal is completely barebone when comparing features with Telegram. Well, i assume its partially true that Telegram IS NOT open source, at least from what I learnt the Core isn't open sourced.

But some other code bases are [open source](https://telegram.org/apps#source-code) 

* [Database Library](https://github.com/tdlib/td)
* [Android](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram)
* [iOS](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS)
* [and More](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger)

I am not open source pro nor a software developer, so I don't know what others feel about this, but as far as I concern, it's better than nothing. 

So in my opinion, it's slightly better than WhatsApp in this situation telegram is not open source. and not more secure. 

signal is it‚Äôs actually less secure. thats the point thats what makes it less secure. 

just use messenger or hangouts then I dont know what you‚Äôre talking about. 

I did both of those just last night. you can start a conversation on any device and continue on any device. 

the only time history wont show is if you link a brand new device. which, once set up, is not an issue again > telegram is not open source

it is I think you're missing the idea of whatsapp sharing your stuff, no matter the encryption Security is not the only qualifier of ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù. But to each his own :) Yes. It works now. I was a signal user back in 2016-17. When they had a chrome addon for the desktop client. It did not work then.

Probably OP remembers an older version and has not used signal since. I am just guessing encryption algorythm is close source, that being said you must be suspicious about your data being handle

Telegram is not entirely open source, and that make some eyebrows rise they have access to metadata only. 

and if you have cloud backups. 

otherwise they still have E2EE. 

whereas Telegram doesn‚Äôt have E2EE on to begin with. only for Secret chats. The problem is that security is the main aspect when you want to have private convo. Telegram fails its first test, to have private conversation where it's not possible for anyone to snoop into the chat.

Of course everyone's threat model is different, but between the two there's a clear winner when it comes to security. actually it was a mix of 2 issues now that I look at it again. I recently installed it and wanted to check if that worked, so I ran a test with a friend. at first he couldn't find me because he added me to his contacts lists without using the full international number, but I could find him no problems, so I talked to him and we started a conversation on my mobile device (this was AFTER I installed the desktop app and linked it). then when I wanted to check the conversation on the desktop client, it wasn't there. so he then corrects my number on his contacts list and talks to me, and I see the chat on the desktop client but weirdly not on the phone... so I replied to him there, but I didn't see my reply on the phone.

So I just thought it didn't work and didn't think much of it. now I double checked because u/ginshis said it worked and I see I have 2 different chat windows with the same user... so something must have messed up when he corrected my number... which brings me again to the problem of Signal being very finicky with how you registered your contacts. I don't know if this is a problem isolated to anyone outside the US but in my country if you don't register your contacts with the full international version of the phone number, then it doesn't work. This used to be a problem with whatsapp as well AGES ago, AND with Telegram... but both of them have solved it. Looks like Signal needs to address it as well... Good luck explaining it to my parents. 

So I'll use both but I get the impression most ""non-techie"" people will switch to Telegram instead. (it is in fact what they're doing) > encryption algorythm is close source,

It is not. How is it even possible to have closed source e2e encryption in an open source client? It seems like you're technically illiberal

>Telegram is not entirely open source

Yeah, it's not like you have an ability to check Signal's server side anyway, so it's irrelevant. The whole point of e2ee is that you don't care about server side security. You're right, encryption protocol is open source, the server side is closed, I just check the repo 

Only wish secret chats were by default."

Basically, your data such as who you talk to, where you're from, what your phone type is, your telephone number, when you're most often online, what your location is - all of that is collected by WhatsApp. With this change they will now officially have permission to share that data with Facebook, which will, in turn, share it with advertisers and god knows who else. You'll get targeted ads everywhere and your personal info will be profited off of, without you getting any benefit.

Note that, contrary to the current misinformation, that does *not* mean WhatsApp will read your messages or anything like that."
Is this true? Can we trust them?;6;kx4lkq;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/yne5ivpuiab61.png;5;;2021-01-14 15:20:07;Yes, but that doesn't mean the whats app doesn't collect any data. Facebook knows everything about the message just not its content, they collect all of metadata. While Whatsapp is e2e (end to end) encrypted ot doesn't mean it's 'safe' to use. I would recommend signal for a more secure, private, and safer messaging app. https://www.securemessagingapps.com/ lol. Metadata like who you're talking to, how long did it take to write, bla bla bla, metadata that can almost give context to you as a user is still being collected. They KNOW  who are in your contacts list. And that is bad enough already. Let alone their plans of targeted ads IN whatsapp in the future. It‚Äôs true, partially. Although they say that the messages are end-to-end encrypted, you have no way of knowing if its true, since you can‚Äôt access their source code to verify it. If Facebook were a trustworthy company, it would be no problem at all, but everyone knows what they do with your privacy in other apps like Facebook or Instagram or the amounts of legal issues they have because of it. The metadata that they collect is for itself alone enough to make you switch to signal, but you should consider that they could be lying about their encryption, which wouldn‚Äôt be the first time that they have done something like it no Yes it's true.

Privacy. I wouldn't give them the courtesy of an honest reason. They deceive us, so I will be repaying them in kind. ""I heard a rumor"" What happens when you hit other?

That's that.

Click 'other' is acceptable as a reason. You may provide a more specific reason but this is optional. Then you can proceed to delete account. Did you now? I don't think many who are panicking now actually have read it. Some might, but definitely not the majority. > I don't think many who are panicking now actually have read it.

But they maybe trust their close ""techie"" relatives who might have read it... I mean you don't need to go to medical school and get a degree just so you can trust your doctor. If your cousin is an IT expert that has been working in the field for like 15 years and he tells you ""hey you might want to ditch that app"" would you trust him more that whatever an app that makes their business by datamining their users tells you? I would. If it was something trustworthy, sure. Though most will just be following the meme posts they see all over the interwebs. Including many of the tech savvy cousins. Ok so you're suggesting that in *this particular case* people are blowing it out of proportion and whatsapp isn't being overly intrusive in their data mining and sharing? is that what you're saying? because if that's what you're saying, you're wrong. I'm saying people aren't actually reading and just going off on what they see in the memes. The policy doesn't actually share much data in peer-to-peer conversations, it's mostly about conversations with businesses. If you don't like that, don't talk to businesses.

But still, if people read the actual policy and disagree with it, sure they can go. The whole media circus around it is stupid. If they start with business conversations, imagine what they're going to do next. It's basically consumers saying ""hold up right there, I know where you're gonna go next"".

&#x200B;

Yes it's an assumption at this stage, but it is also a bold statement. I've been meaning to leave whatsapp but now that everyone is moving in droves the user case to use alternatives is now there.

Instagram and Facebook are for things you are knowingly publicly publish. 
WhatsApp is for private communication between people. 
There are easily available tools for Facebook and Instagram that prevent them from tracking you or showing adverts. 
You can prevent Facebook from uploading your contacts, you can‚Äôt do that with WhatsApp 

There‚Äôs enough of a difference in my opinion. This is why the WhatsApp changes are so insidious. You either accept unnecessary data SHARING or you stop using the messenger. This default for data sharing should be off, WhatsApp should collect only the minimum data it needs to run the service and anything else should be opt-in. For example, they could have an opt in to share data only with specific businesses that you message. If you don‚Äôt message a business then your data stays private. But instead they‚Äôve made it a global decision with no choice. Hmm i think not Instagram is way worse than Whatsapp. They also changed their privacy conditions a fews weeks ago and it‚Äôs way scarier than those of Whatsapp. They can access your camera and microphone whenever they like, they can collect all your information from your phone and all the devices of every device that is connected to the same router (except messages and photos, supposedly), they can track your IP, read your unencrypted messages in the app, etc. So as a whole, it is worse to have Instagram installed, but some people only care about their privacy when it is about their messages Its still less data if you only delete one app. 

Chat history is more important than Facebook likes or Instagram photos. I need my chat history to remain private more so than the other 2. 

With that said. Of course you should delete all 3. Move your groups to Signal. You don‚Äôt really need Facebook or Instagram. 

Other replacements will pop up eventually But still, It can collect search history, places I've been, sites history, and more. So If I don't want to share those with facebook, I need to delete ALL facebook's app, not only the WhatsApp, right? For now I switched to telegram, and steel using Facebook and Instagram but on browser to block them tracking the most of the data. I have to use them because there are groups I *need*, I don't use it very much, just for specific groups and people I need.

Thanks for the advices anyway (: It can‚Äôt collect the dat a about sites if you use the Privacy settings on a browser (or a browser like DuckDuckGo) to access Facebook or if you use a Facebook/Instagram app like Friendly that stops all tracking. You can‚Äôt do that with WhatsApp and that‚Äôs a crucial difference. I do not want to surf too much on the subject, but I have to ask, how do I use privacy settings on chrome? And how can I get the ""like friendly"" apps that don't track me? I really need that! Look for Friendly in your App Store or Play Store. I wouldn‚Äôt use Chrome for privacy. Best to install a browser like DuckDuckGo. Also consider installing something like Malwarebytes or Firefox which have privacy features. Yeah, I thought about switching chrome, but I really like the sync with my account and my other devices. And I don't want to use another browser for all of my devices because the chrome flags are super useful. So for now, I think chrome will be my browser because of functionality and comfort.


This is what you mean with the friendly facebook/instagram? If I will use this app they can't track my data?

[Friendly social browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.friendly) Thanks buddy Yes as it says, it blocks trackers. You can import chrome data to firefox on a pc then use firefox sync (it requires an account, which is fine since mozilla is a trusted nonprofit You can use Brave is based on chromuim but better then chrome come by default with ad blockers and privacy settings.

I've made a profile picture and status for WhatsApp to notify my contacts I'm moving to telegram. So here you have it.;49;kwt86f;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kwt86f;16;;2021-01-14 02:44:54;"Excellent, will share and make it my DP. Any chance you could do one for WhatsApp->Signal? I don‚Äòt get why anyone leaving WhatsApp over privacy related reasons would even debate going to Telegram, a messenger without forced E2EE that hides their secret chat option (with a proprietary encryption mechanism that has NOT been audited by anyone) away in a 3-dot menu on a contacts page... by guys that sold their last big project to the highest bidder, wanting to introduce ads in 2021.

1 step forward, 2 steps back style. Great Noice Moving to telegram is (when net forced manually) a step backward in privacy üò© There you go, straight from the official Signal Twitter account [https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1349236175773462532](https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1349236175773462532) > by guys that sold their last big project to the highest bidder

Not what happened.

The reason people are leaving for Telegram because it has great features, isn't owned by Shitbook and has a good track record in protecting users, unlike WhatsApp. is signal better? Umm. Saying telegram hides the secret chat option is a bit much. Assuming everyone wants E2E is a bit much as well.

Telegram made a product choice. If you go the E2E route, you compromise on certain ease of use features. They do it to primarily allow cloud sync and seamless interaction across devices. Without having the need to have a phone around. Plus you can share files etc on telegram from any device and have that available on any other linked device. 

Everyone might not want that. But thats a choice telegram made. Also you can have any number of linked devices.

Plus they can do things like instant forward without having the need to download the media first. 

Also AFAIK the MTProto 2.0 spec is available to everyone, and in fact has been audited by several researchers No Signal is from a privacy standpoint the superior alternative, but it lacks features Telegram and WhatsApp have. That being said WhatsApp implements the same protocol Signal uses so it‚Äòs message content is secure. In my opinion E2EE should be mandatory and not an optional feature. I think a messenger storing messages, pictures and so on without E2EE on their server is a hugh security risk. Moreover, the latest information i have is that Signal is proven to be secure while such proofs do not exist for Telegram.

Signal (and soon Threema) allows multi-device support without an active phone, Threema even without a phone at all. Sharing files also works for both. Yes, they have less features then Telegram, but I would not rate higher than WA in terms of security. Telegram also stores the contact list (yes that can be revoked, but I dont want to choose between not seeing my contacts or giving them all my contacts). So privacy is also highly questionable.

Telegram also collects meta-data.

After all, I would consider Telegram as a version of WA with more features but even less security.

Source: https://telegram.org/privacy thank you! Your opinion on E2EE being mandatory is totally justified. And if it makes sense for you, then thats perfect. I would just like to point out that E2EE in itself is not a ‚Äúone medicine cures all‚Äù solution. A lot of people are leaving an app which has E2EE. The fact is companies like google and Facebook have made us paranoid. And now we cannot imagine being safe unless we have the maximum security possible. I personally use both Signal and Telegram. 

Telegram never wanted to be WhatsApp. They have their unique ecosystem of internal apps and bots which are just not possible with E2EE. They are going for a feature rich messenger. Not a stripped down one.

I would personally rate telegram ‚Äúsecret chat‚Äù more private than a WhatsApp chat. I would even go as far as to say it is about on par as a signal chat. (Verifiable) Clarifying again - i am referring to the secret chat. Normal messages are not E2EE, but they cant be to allow tue functionality that telegram provides.


Also telegram does not collect metadata for secret chats (verifiable). But it kind of has to for normal chats to enable advanced features

Also from telegram‚Äôs website -

‚ÄúUnlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync. As a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 2 GB each. And if you don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always keep it in the cloud.‚Äù

Signal is a more direct alternative to WhatsApp. Telegram is more than just a chat app. I agree with your last point. I think Telegram can be better compared to Discord than Signal. No focus on perfect secure messaging but on features, large open chats, cloud based and so on."

For Google, I try to minimize by using other browsers, alternate email services whenever I can, but some of their services are linked to Android phones which for sure collect a lot of info on us.

For amazon, I do check if other stores offer the same products and try to promote them, but that seems to be a losing battle.  I do not use any Alexa, Google Homes, etc., - I can easily get up and switch on the light or select a song to play.  Thank you.

Why you shouldn't listen to WhatsApp & switch to Signal. (Explained In detail & in simple language.);55;kwo2rp;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kwo2rp/why_you_shouldnt_listen_to_whatsapp_switch_to/;129;"Why you shouldn't listen to WhatsApp & switch to Signal. (Explained In detail & in simple language.)

*I) Privacy*

1) Signal code is open source. 

2) Signals encryption is verified by worldwide cryptanalysts and audited. There is total transparency here unlike WhatsApp.

[Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and an Extended Triple Diffie‚ÄìHellman (X3DH) handshake] .

Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256 are the primitives used.

3) Signal team consists of less than 7 members so the trust factor between the creator and his team remains high. No intelligence pressure here to create backdoors.

4) if backdoors are introduced. They cannot be introduced in the encryption method, but will have to in the apk.

5) Since it is open source, everyone will know it's compromised.

6) Now, the switch from WhatsApp is being made not because WhatsApp can read your actual text or see your media, but because of metadata.

7) what is metadata? It is data mined using analytical tools that track your usage on the app, location info, transactional info, duration of chat with particular group, particular no., identifier data, etc. An image is shared below for the whole list.

8) so except your actual chat and media, all your other data is up for grabs.

9) The question here is, why won't WhatsApp say what data they actually mine instead of focusing on what they don't mine.
And why do they need our data in the 1st place

When apps like Signal without data collection give the same chat experience?

10) Facebook as a company is known for it's privacy scandals. *Their entire business model is based on mining your data & selling it to advertisers*

11) In this case, it is just plain and simple bs, when WhatsApp tells you, your data is safe with them.

12) Policies can be updated any time. This is just the beginning. As the data mining business model on WhatsApp becomes profitable, it will not stop, it will be developed further to be more & more intrusive. Just like Facebook.

13) The metadata will be shared with Facebook & Facebook in turn will share it with 3rd parties to show you ads on IG & FB.

14) The best advice is - stay away from all Facebook apps. 

*II) Effect on Mental health.*

1) Analytical tools keep you hooked to use the app more & more by studying your behaviour ( usage time etc) & showing  you what you like.

2) Facebook pays millions to behavioural scientists & psychologists to keep you hooked. 

3) The effect is unnatural & keeps giving you dopamine hits every time you like a post on FB which keeps you coming for more.

4) Dopamine - a chemical messenger is responsible for reward, motivation, memory, attention etc.

5) Continuous release of dopamine is bad & produces the same effects as that drug addicts can suffer.

(Too much of reward is bad? Use your common sense. )

6) This is basically tinkering with your brain by use of analytical tools by social media companies. In the long term, they eat away your willpower & weaken your will. Your ability to say ""no"" to things, reduces drastically.

7) These are long tern effects which are not noticeable in the short term. If you want to quit social media & you can't, these tools are the reason you can't. They are made to keep you hooked & study your behaviour continuously.

8) This long term usage can cause depression/anxiety. Your ability to focus on things that uplift you reduces. 

9) Your control over your decision making ability is indirectly tinkered with using analytical tools & you become the product.

*III) How Facebook benefits.*

1) Your data is sold to advertisers and every company involved makes money from it. They use you to build them further and you are now their biggest resource.

2) Facebook doesn't care about your mental health. Zuckerberg doesn't care about your mental health. 
He is only afraid of losing people on his platform. 

3) He has to only make sure, you keep using it to keep his platform alive &  profitable. 

Forward this if you support good tech & care about the tech you & your loved ones use.";2021-01-13 22:39:29;"An honest question:
Why would I be concerned about whatsapp/facebook selling my metadata to advertisers? I get served ads based on those and that doesn't sound super evil that way, they gotta make money somehow.

And secondly, how am I personally affected if I do not use their other platforms like facebook or IG ever. I don't have an account on either, so if facebook sells my stuff to advertisers they don't get a return from it since I will never see their ads.

Granted, I already use signal for a ton of chats but I am just curious as to your opinion regarding this. How does signal compare to telegram? Lot of people are going to that one, too. And I wonder which is better I stopped reading in #2 . Whatsapp and signal uses exact the same open source encryption Signal stores user metadata like timestamps. No different than whatsapp. Man I read your post and it is hilarious. Specially the end. Do you think social media causes mental health issues?!!

Haven't you had enough seeing people refusing to wearing mask under a pandemic. Or people rioting capitol because a twat said it so?

 People were, are and will be dumb and manipulated. That's a fact. Don't blame social networks for that. It is just the trend now. Politicians doesn't like people to be able to use a central platform. They prefer many smaller platforms so nobody can challenge their outreach
 
20 yars ago the bad was Microsoft. Now everybody keeps using its OS, keeps writing word documents and play it's xbox Facebook & WhatsApp can update their policies anytime. The intrusive practises of mining your data will never reduce, we can agree to that for a fact. Best examples are Facebook & IG itself. 

For now, advertisers maybe limited. But later they can share your data with Amazon. Just like the Apple & Google deal. And that list of companies *may* just increase with time. It makes sense to add more companies to increase the revenue.

Advertisement revenues drive these companies, so one can anticipate that the changes in policies are not that far. Say 2023 or 25.

Even if WhatsApp doesn't share the data directly. It will share with Fb & Ig & through them the advertisers can reach you on other platforms. Some examples are Fb/IG buttons on webpages. Sign in with your account etc. Even if you sign in with Google,  & they have a deal with Fb, ads are gonna pop up somewhere. mostly because when there is a leak, your chat history will be available for the world to see. 

even if you deleted your chat history Its actually a good question not many people ask. Here are my views, hopefully it is helpful.

1. They don't just show you ads for things to buy at a discounted price, they also offer you video, news, discussions, and music recommendations based on that data.
2. You can develop a habit to ignore these ads or use an adblock but we can't expect the same from society at large, which is how the data can be used for mass disinformation.
3. The ad for products they show you could also be used in the long term to restrict the visibilty of certain products based on big techs relations with those other companies in regards to political or economic leanings and so on. This is the kind of power we should not just hand out to anyone as it can easily be used to skew the market in favour of certain groups. The most common example is of political parties and how outcome of election can be greatly influenced through this.
4. The tracking can in a more dystopian (becoming more likely I think) world, be used to target you for things other than ads, political witch hunt, censorship, decreasing the reach of your voice on different platforms, to ""cancel"" you for your opinions and beliefs and so on.

In summary, if these platforms only focused on using the data to show you ads for things you are looking for but do not know exist or for a a good deal in general it would be fine. But increasingly the data is being used in ways we do not generally anticipate till after the fact. Most of the points I have highlighted are not a just a possible future scenario but happening around the world as we speak for this aspect start looking at how Zoom used to censor Chinese dissidents and how UN outed some of their workers to Chinese government or what Cambridge Analytica was all about or massive misinformation campaigns. All of these things were possible because of lack of anonymity and privacy. Telegram has decided to monetize their app through ads. https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/telegram-to-launch-an-ad-platform-as-it-approaches-500-million-users/

Signal is the only platform that doesn't want your data. They genuinely care about your privacy. If the only thing you care for is privacy, Signal might be a better option, but for a balance of privacy and features, nothing comes close to Telegram.  
  
Here are a few features that Telegram has compared to Signal:  
  
‚Ä¢ Editing messages   
‚Ä¢ Sending documents and videos up to 2GB  
‚Ä¢ Deleting messages without a trace  
‚Ä¢ Native desktop and tablet apps  
‚Ä¢ Multiple accounts and Chat folders  
‚Ä¢ Usernames instead of phone numbers  
‚Ä¢ Granular privacy settings  
‚Ä¢ Group chats of up to 200,000 members  
‚Ä¢ Admin tools and stats for group owners  
‚Ä¢ Voice Chats for up to 5,000 participants  
‚Ä¢ 20,000+ high-quality Animated stickers  
‚Ä¢ Custom Color Themes like Retro  
‚Ä¢ Video messages   
‚Ä¢ One-to-many channels  
‚Ä¢ Video editing tools  
‚Ä¢ API and Bot platform for developers  
‚Ä¢ Programmed emoji  
‚Ä¢ Disappearing photos or videos  
‚Ä¢ Self-Destructing end-to-end encrypted Chats  
‚Ä¢ Partial selection for messages  
‚Ä¢ Scheduled and silent messages  
‚Ä¢ Pinned messages and polls  
‚Ä¢ Persistent chat history  
‚Ä¢ Saved Messages and Drafts   
‚Ä¢ Encrypted Voice and Video Calls Total transparency here means=  encryption + open source code.

WhatsApp uses same encryption but they are not open source, hence not totally transparent. Yes, account creation date & last used date. That is not much of a use to advertisers & people who buy your data. I know social media fucks with your head at some degree from personal experience. Deleting Facebook was one of the best things I've done.

Though to be fair I think it's more kicking a bad addiction. Not so much mental health. Yes, it maybe hillarious, but I personally think, Man was not made to socialize via networks. Socializing in person gives you a wholesome natural experience which involves you being in the present moment with all your sensory organs working in unison.

That experience is filled with a lot of details that your brain can remember easily & is in a way healthy & natural.

When you socialize on the internet, only a part of your  sensory organs are in use, like your eyes for eg. This can be less fullfilling & in time alters the way you feel. You adapt to feel less & do more. Your experience of connecting becomes more shallow.

Social anxiety, Social awkwardness, depression etc. may develop at later stages if you don't maintain a balance by socializing in person. Introverts have a higher chance of being affected. 

Many, drastically reduce their ability to truly connect with people. They aren't able to feel much. Their depth of feeling becomes shallow-er. Even your memory, your ability to remember, becomes weaker.

These are the risks of social media. I personally think, mental health issues have increased for this reason. 

It can be changed though, if we limit our use of social media & digital experience &  try to spend as much time as we can in nature, natural surroundings,   interacting naturally with others. It is more fullfilling, more wholesome & develops your abillity to connect & feel. There is more depth in every experience.

That is the only reason, I wrote the effects on mental health section. It felt important & necessary. That doesn't answer the question.... So what if they sell the data? Just ignore all ads. 

Do you know your bank sells your data (Name, address) to credit companies. And I guess you are just ignoring them.... Do the same with fb and get free service And if you are worried about Cambridge Analytics, you shouldn't be blaming fb, or even Cambridge Analystica. 

You should be blaming people who voted out of opinions from the internet instead of looking for truthful sources. That is the real problem on society, that people doesn't give a shit For now because the have fewer users.

Telegram or whatsapp are not evil. They just need to pay the bills. Signal bills are still under control due to its small user base Until Elon Musk buys himself in. What about all the other aspects of it? Telegram's best in that regard without a doubt, feature rich, fast, slick.

Unfortunately, there's only privacy or there's no privacy. There's no in between. In case of Telegram, Cloud Chat alone turns me off so I won't ever use it on personal chat. For Channel/Public Group it's fine, it's just like Reddit in general. Total transparence will become harder when you have to serve 2b users 

Let's see how a non profit , non business model app pays for the servers, how it scale and how it pays for the engineers to mantaine it's network.

In this life there are tradeoffs: you want ad free, then pay for the app. You want free app, then pay with your data. You don't want to pay neither with data or money, then you LL have a crappy system and probably much more insecure than whatsapp Sorry to say that, but probably the root cause of your problem is not social media. I would advice you to mingle more with people and to relate with family.  Have real interaction and care less what other people have or say about themselves (they only show their best on social media)

Normally people who are having issues with social media are people who do not have enough interactions to see the truth of what people says in social media, or people who do not feel totally secure. They may end being confused on what the reality is.

Note I am not insulting you, we all suffer some kind of issues. The best way to overcome them is to face them, not to find scapegoats to blame You know what my grandma (94) said people were saying in the past about the radio: that it would break families. People would sit and hear to the radio instead of talking each other and care about the rest .

Progress in the long run is never bad, otherwise go back to a caves, no water, no electricity, no health care, no nothing.

Neither FB, whatsapp, tv, radio, cars, music or any human invention is to blame about mental health. Mental health problems have always been there and they will be there. So my advice to you is: find the courage  (which is not easy) to get exposed, forget about excuses. Live to win, date to fail. The level of tools used to study your behaviour is too  high. Banks don't use the same tools. So blame yourself for not being able to? Good. The other option is stop indulging in such activity & providing such services. 

It's like, it's the people's fault for being present during 9/11. It's their fault they died. The terrorist will attack anywhere they want to. We cannot blame them or stop them. The people who died should have anticipated the attack was coming...Nice. > For now because the have fewer users.

I agree. One of the Signal founders is the guy who created whatsapp. The founder's argument that, by having non profit structure for Signal, ""the whole point is to build something that it is independent and sustainable that CAN'T be bought"". I'm still not convinced.

They could've retained that $1/year but [he sold out to FB for $19billion](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/9jdtv5/whatsapp_cofounder_i_sold_my_users_privacy_to/). Who's the say he's not going to do it again?


Switching messaging app is a pain point, I don't want to do it again every now and then. Elon might be an anonymous donor, since he doesn't like Facebook for good reason. Even Jack Dorsey. Didn't whatsapp used to cost money? I'd love to pay for a good app like $5 a year every Jan 1 to guarantee using it. And maybe unlock the ability to send uncompressed images Yes, Total transparency will become harder. The founders may face a fate similar to the Piratebay Founders if they refuse to bend.

What triggered me is, Facebook could have given two options, Agree to the terms & conditions or Pay for an ad free experience. (which is done by Youtube & it's successful.)

Instead of giving the pay option, which was totally doable, they issued an ultimatum for account deletion, which was totally unnecessary. You should watch The Social Dilemma. Yeah, whatever she said maybe true. But the above reasoning which I have given on social media & mental health is also true. 

These are not excuses. This is reality, which you don't want to ignore. The choice is yours, it's an individual choice.

 It comes down to whether you're willing to pay the price. The price for using a digital experience to accomplish more while feeling less. Quality vs Quantity. Banks do not use that because they are not social network companies.

Banks do much more behaviour studies on society that lead us to one of the worst crisis (for example all the wrong analysis they did on the buy power of american families that lead banks to create toxic mortgage package they sold all around the world to financial institutions)

The difference is understanding the 2009 crisis is difficult, but complaining about cotidian things like ads is easy. Are you comparing advertisers to terrorists? I think tha flaws your reasonign

Again it is like saying that McDonald s is murdering fat people.

If people is depressed is not because FB. It is because they have issues. Those issues will be exposed either way He sold it, he is crazy billionaire due to that and now he complains. He should have done like Snap chat creator and keep it when Zuckerberg knocked his door The point you raise is valid and fair but at the same time, if we want something that is supposedly secure and does not cost anything we will have to rely on Signal for now, next time they decide to sell the company we will have no choice but to switch.
I am aware of some companies in the EU that charge a certain fee for messaging service but they are a bit on the expensive side for most Indians so I can't motivate people around me to pay and move to a new app so for now I will encourage them to go with Signal if they don't have any reservations against it and their contacts are moving too. Elon Musk has never done anything anonymously. As far as we know. /s
Signal might like privacy now, until someone buys it and makes it commercial too. Everything is for sale. > And maybe unlock the ability to send uncompressed images

Compressing images that I send drives me mad tbh. Fuck compression. Let users decide. Yes Whatsapp tried to charge for some time in Europe. It was a big catastrophe. People were mad (same as now) and they were losing both customers and add revenue.

Targeted ad is the best model to sustain a quality app free to the user. Because if it is shown in tv it must be true I understand but social media does more good than bad, specially keeping in touch with long distance relations or allowing contacts between interest groups you wouldn't meet otherwise 

Your reasoning is the same as if you had lost a relative in a car accident and were mad at auto industry for building cars

So instead of being mad at FB why don't you blame Apple for promoting smart phone in 2008? Why don't you blame google for letting you find facebook? Why don't you just blame the internet inventors for bringing such a bad thing?

Hadn't FB existed, your depression would have surfaced other way. Yes, the degree & power of analytical tools is causing the damage. There should be an option for an opt-out. 

Not an opt out from ads, but a total opt-out from analysis. People should be given an option to pay for such opt-out measures. It's because people have issues, but Facebook choses to exploit them anyway.

I am using your analogy of not blaming cambridge analytica & blaming yourself for not being able to find the truthful sources in a haystack of fake news that is paid to appear front of all the truthful news. You can't buy a non profit like that. The question again: who the F pays for all the capacity uncompress media means? Because you want the thing to be free and ad free.

You know, the problem is people doesn't understand how those services work. When you send a message, this message is not send to the phone. There is no way to do that. You send te message to a server and the server sends it to the phone (either using push or pull mechanism). So in fact your uncompress message would be send not 9ne but twice. 

Now imagine 2B people sending uncompress pictures. Oh I see. I'd like to have both options if ads are unavoidable. Like 5 bucks a year or ads. No monthly fee though that's just crazy Sound logic & reasoning make it true. Not because it's shown on tv.

& you're free to think whatever you want to, but there is always only one truth in an haystack of possibilties. I don't blame them. I blame usage of analytical tools to study behaviour & exploit pyschology.

The good & bad are debatable. Most of them focus on the good, without knowing the depth of bad. Im highlighting the depth of bad here.

As i said earlier, it's an individual choice. Whether you wish to pay the price for a digital experience or not. People should just know what is being sacrificed too, which is rarely spoken about. [https://www.wired.com/story/why-dont-we-just-ban-targeted-advertising/](https://www.wired.com/story/why-dont-we-just-ban-targeted-advertising/) Read this. None of this answers the question why I or anyone else would care for the analysis. Personally I see no reason to opt out on any of the pages, even living in Europe where websites always have to ask you what you want them to do - I always choose the ""all"" option, because those are features, and I see no reason why I'd disable those. It gives them money and myself good ads No man you get it wrong. Issues are there anyway. Fb is not looking for you to get depressed. Fb just wants to show an ad of something you may be interested.  It is up to you to decide if you buy it

The content other people post is what creates you the issue. But Fb only acts as a messenger. You would have the same problem the day somebody told you how amazing is his life and show you his last vacation trip to an exotic place.

Tell me, how difficult is just not use FB? Or how difficult is use AdBlocker in your browser?; Says who? If the owner of the project sells it to Elon, it's sold. Doesn't even have to be public. I would not disagree with that. I guess they eventually will try that. But I guess they don't want to do this just for one of their apps. If this ever happen probably will be rolled out in all Whatsapp, FB, Instagram, Messenger Yes , aliens theories sounded logic in X Files too.

It is just pictures of other people. Problem is people get addicted to food, sex, shopping, money, steeling, work, etc ...  Should we stop all of them? Or should we educated properly so people doesn't get addicted to the first drug they find? Do you think tv works differently? The only difference is you were born with it and you learn to ignore what of it's content it is not essential to you.

The problem some people have with internet is they are not learning to ignore what is not essential.

Unfortunately in life there is going to be deception. This happens in nature too (see how birds dance and move opening their feather to look bigger and stronger). So deception is something a human/animal needs to learn to detect. 

We can't stop progress because some people didn't want to drive a car and wanted to ride horses. We can not stop social media because some people get depressed when they see pictures of other people showing their fake-awesome life.


My grandma also said this: tell me what you have and I will tell you what you lack. Basically people who show off on social media is people not happy with their life and need to feel satisfaction posting people.... Same when a guy buys a expensive car or woman wears branded clothes.... Why do you think politicians put so much effort on baning ads , bit do not give a shit of banning a real drug and dangerous for health like tobacco?

I tell you why: tobacco doesn't help in votes. But Facebook can help to spread an idea faster than a politician use to do.

So any politician will be against any big platform like that. 

Also, do you think if you guys crack targeted ads you'll do anything? No , then chinese companies will come and take their place and do not give a shit. 

You will just kill the powerhouses of the USA and give it to chinese companies... Very smart If you don't care about privacy, then you can continue using WhatsApp, giving your metadata to companies and letting the mine you. Consent is important. In your case, it shouldn't affect you.   
Many in the world care about their privacy, mental health and other things including healthy business models that contribute to society. If there are causes for concern, usually we debate it and find the solution. Nobody likes ads man. It's plain & simple. You want to show ads, fine show. Don't study my damn behaviour & manipulate me. Ads gotta be random.

Targetted ads are too intrusive. Take my money & stop studying me. This is why people like privacy. This is the reason to switch to signal. Analytical tools. Dude , take a minute to google. Non-profits don't have owners or shareholders. You can't sell. It would be ridiculous if it worked that way. Why would people donate to these organizations if they had a owner who could sell at anytime. If they tried it, i feel like the paid option would be very greedy. So idk I guess the longer it's free the better Desires, people often succumb to them. Education works upto a certain level. But advertising studies behaviour & psychology in today's world. Planting a desire/idea is all you have to do.

Using these techniques actively doesn't do us any good. It diminishes our control over time. Many in the world lack a high degree of self control, education won't stop you here.

If your desire is too strong, if it builds overtime, you simply succumb to it. Studying at a behavioural level to find exploits is just plain & simply bad. 

If you want to change your lifestyle, your way of living, it is extremely challenging to do so. Many people in the world who aren't educated to this level are unable to actively ignore the ads. If you switch off your tv, it stays off. It isn't that way with ads on the internet. You turn off one app eg: FB & IG, open your browser, you still get them.

In todays world, as long as you are online, you will see ads. It's impact & reach & damage & even the good are at a greater level. 

It alters you. Your natural interaction with everyone & everything becomes limited & very limited in many cases. I've already spoken about this in the other comment. Progress is unavoidable. The journey should be good. If it's not healthy, if it's not good. The price paid is more than you want to. Many don't understand this & many forget it. That is why it's important to speak about it every now & then as a constant reminder. Tiktok was banned. Chinese apps will be banned. Targeted ads should be banned. Why would anyone want a system spamming you with ads everyday? If it's chinese, all the more reason to ban. With privacy, there comes the big question of security. Well that is a fair point - though I wouldn't draw a direct correlation between data analysis and bad mental health.
Also I don't see anything here that is linked to some kind of bad business model - though I also wouldn't describe a business model that doesn't contribute to society as one that is bad - that's not the point of a business model imho Treat your user like a human. Apple does this. Respect their privacy. Users are not products. Deployment of Analytical tools treat users like products instead of humans.

I don't want some private company studying my behaviour & habits, discovering flaws just to exploit them. It's damn creepy. It's intrusive. 

Watch Transcendence. Jhonny Depp plays the main character & his wife get's creeped at the end of the movie, because he knows what she's about to think. Nobody wants that. Why are targeted ads intrusive? I rather see ads for things I care about and might want than of random shit.
These companies pay for people clicking their ads, so it's only a natural conclusion you get served more ads that you might click. There's no point in sending you ads they know you'll never click.

Sorry to break it to you, but this is just how capitalism works. Keep up the good work fellow human. Don‚Äôt let these devils advocates/shills/bots/total fucking morons grind you down. Uh, yes. If the chairmen and CEO decide to sell, they can sell. No one will stop them. They lose the tax benefits probably, but that's besides the point.

People donate because they believe and hope they won't sell if the donations are high enough. Doesn't mean they can't. So we end up with the conundrum: tell me any communication system in history that is all three: reliable,  secure and free Many people who are uneducated aren't able to achieve many things. Ads is one of lesser concerns to them.

There will always be weeker and stronger. That's life. We can't sandbox everything. It is unfair for the majority, so not democratic

I want a quality product, reliable , secure, and free. I am ok paying with my personal meta data. I am ok (and even interested) on targeted ads (which I will mostly ignore). 

Why I can't have this service just because some people are not able to control their urges? I walk in the street and I see ads. I get into the subways I hear ads. I buy a t-shirt, and you know what? I become a walking ad!. Oh man. That's over. You speak without knowing shit. Til tok was threaten to be banned. Never banned. 

You are just using email chains as information instead of doing your research.  That's how people end up thinking earth is flat.

FACT CHECKING I've done a bit of explaining on how I personally think they are related upto a certain extent with each other in the last comment of this post. You can read & let me know your thoughts. I think you are right: you have swallowed too much advertisment and become a Apple fan boy....

If you knew systems you would understand how evil apple is and how much better google and Facebook are (specially with their contributions to OpenSource)

Using an example from a movie to try to discredit FB does not hold either. Trascendece is just a movie, 1984 is just a book and animal farm should be a mandatory book in education.

Time to go to bed. Hope you get better now that signal has cured all mental illness in the world ;) Sorry, but that doesn't mean it's always going to work for people. It doesn't mean it's gonna be the best choice for that person or people. Money would otherwise solve 100% of the problems of the world. [https://www.wired.com/story/why-dont-we-just-ban-targeted-advertising/](https://www.wired.com/story/why-dont-we-just-ban-targeted-advertising/) Read this. Targetted ads are at the center of everything that's wrong with the internet. Ahh yes, the pick 2 triangle of options Paying for an ad free experience should be an option. Deletion is a bad option. We both can agree Mark messed up here. Again, ads affect people & their choices. Influencing people. Influencing their choices. Too much of something is bad. eg: Sugar.

Analytical tools, targetted ads, behavioural analysis are the whole reason for this switch from WhatsApp to Signal. If you can't get that, nobody can help you. 
People are indirectly telling Facebook, we don't like your business model. We want privacy now. Swallowing too much of ads are not bad. Ads are good. Free service is worth paying for with your data. I think, maybe you don't value your privacy as highly as others do or you don't care, which is even more foolish. Tiktok was banned in India. Nice personal attacks though. I hate apple lol. Being a Fanboy is out of thr question. But I understand their services towards their users when it comes to targetted ads. 

Using an example from a movie is to make you see my pov. Nonetheless, you are free to think as you see fit.

I would continue to tell people to maximize their natural interaction as long as they live. To embrace everything natural & seek things that are part of a greater good.

Hope you learn to understand better & make better choices. 

Facebook should invest in mental health instead of analytical tools. Anyone who understands the relation between the two will make the proper choice. 

Products/services we support today will accordingly alter the way we live & shape the future. Sure, but random ads are guaranteed to be a waste of money anyhow. There are too many products and to few people to buy them. I agree that payed version could be an option and I think it will be sooner than later 

I don't think Zuckerberg screwed up. Monetizing WhatsApp is something they have been needing since that product doesn't make miney. Also now they have the break up Facebook thing too. So the tighter the apps are  the more difficult breaking facebook will be.

I would have done the same thing if it were my company and 60000 employes and lots of business using my platform depend on that Cool, pay for it and look for a big base of user that want to pay for it.... Donations will not make it too far in a business model.... Se wikipedia they struggle to survive .. and they are just a website. Imagine if you have more complex apps like messaging. You can't base your business out of donations What I am surprised is you care so much about fb, bot you may not even know companies like Equifax or Experian that collect all your personal information, addresses you have lived , credit card usage, any car you may have, any felony... And they sell it for 25$  to anybody they may ask.... And you know what ITS LEGAL.

Why the F is targeted a problem when nobody cares 3 companies like Equifax track all your life?

I guess again is because FB is easy, and credit companies are difficult to understand Wtf cares a third world country who can barely keep their streets clean. The real policy is made in the USA. Whatever happens in USA is applied to the world You know Facebook actually serves people with measurable health issues targeted ads *to help them overcome their issue?* Because that's a likely click for them. 

Smokers will click the quit smoking ad. Non smokers never will. Yes, hence there should be an opt-out for ads & for analytics. This is 2021, they can totally do it. Free users aren't going anywhere especially to those who dont have a problem with ads... Mining data serves more people, than giving an ad free experience. Some entities include the government & 5 eyes. 

Paying for an ad free experience shows me no ads, but my usage is still being monitored, my behaviour still being studied. Signal doesn't do that. Deployment of Analytical tools suck. They are not here to do business. They are here to provide a platform that gives you a way to communicate privately. People like me will support such platforms. We don't need huge features.   


Social Media is not something you need to survive lol. We just need to communicate privately. It has to be minimalistic and serve the purpose of private communication. Other than that, depends on the app founders, whatever new features they wish to introduce. Good luck with that thinking lol. The future is a type-1 civilization. Global products. They need to adhere to the rules of many countries with huge markets. [https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/companies/article/exclusive-if-you-build-for-india-you-build-for-the-world-signal-co-founder-brian-acton-on-whatsapp-privacy/706863](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/companies/article/exclusive-if-you-build-for-india-you-build-for-the-world-signal-co-founder-brian-acton-on-whatsapp-privacy/706863)  


You are just trying to prove that WhatsApp is better than Signal. If you think so, good for you.   
I am here to convince people to support good tech. If you don't like the idea, feel free to walk away and use your time to do what you think is best. That's the worst justification I've ever read lol. No offence. But it makes a good point for a good debate. 

Nonetheless, real change does not come from clicking  ads. It comes from self realisation & one needs a good amount of willpower & willingness to say no to smoking.

As for non-smokers not clicking the ad, it will never show a non-smoker such an ad, because it's a targetted ad. That's why Random ads are so much better, because you can ignore it. It teaches your brain to say no to certain ads.

If you are given things you like continously, it's not healthy. - Its plain & simple common sense. I don't comment on conspiracy theories. I don't think I ever be important enough to be worth monitored by any agency.... So i dont care if FBi knows I like sex with animals.

About paied version: why would fb create a paied version and track your data. That would be dead before starting it. This is simple either you sell your data and you get a free account or you pay your account and do not sell your data. Fb will not try to get payed both ways. That would not work

Also why people is not worried amazon is tracking all their behaviour. They are really selling crap to you and putting shit in front of your eyes.... But amazon is never there. I have spend way more money in amazon than in fb Again, you don not know how internet works: Lyft pays 300M a year to amazon just for their servers. 

Now on top of that pay engineers just to mantain afloat the app daily. 

Good luck finding an steady source of income to generate 400M/year.  Donations do not count No man. I am not trying to prove that.

I am saying that some people complaining about their privacy do not understand shit of that they are talking about. Furthermore the same people requests free, reliable and functional products , which even makes my argument that these people doesn't understand shit stronger.

You want to picture a world with free aps and people working for free so you can send a picture of your ass, fine. But history proves you wrong Enjoy your common sense. I prefer to filter pointless things out of my focus area. You may not be important. The FBI cares about it's program of mass surveillance. If there is no data, they cannot identify people. 

Anyway, you misunderstood. I meant Facebook taking my money and not studying my behaviour serves only Facebook, not the government.

Hence, Facebook is never going to give me an option of not using analytical tools to study me in exchange of money.

3rd parties are always involved. Why would I use Facebook then? Signal gives me both. They take my money, give me no ads, give me an analtyical tool -free usage. Okay Smartie Pants, you know more. Good for you. We are not worried. People in communities support each other and thrive. We don't need to worry about money, just innovate. Great products will automatically attract people.

There are many volunteers with great number of resources including people with great intellectual abilities, who contribute to ideas that change the world. This idea is one of them. Money doesn't drive these people. Passion does. Elon Musk is one of them. You should see videos on youtube, where thinkers have proposed ideas like Money less economies which are totally doable. It has too many benefits than we'd realize. I understand your basic principle - Everything has a cost. How do you expect to pay that cost?

We just need good ideas. Elon has come up with space satellities to fund SpaceX. He sold T shirts for Boring Tunnel, bought a machine, sold bricks, made the tunnel.

People come up with ways. That is what Im trying to convey. Let's see how people support this app. If people like something, they will not let it die. We shouldn't be too worried for now. I don't have the time to filter. I'd just use an app like Signal & donate every month. Works just fine...Take my money, don't mine me. It's that simple. People are often given the illusion of choice. Very few actually give users what they want...Even if Signal is compromised, there will be a new platform. That is how it should always be. Again, I am not going to talk about tinfoil theories. Remember what apple did when the government had to crack into a terrorist iphone. If you don't know, Google it .

Those companies  do not bend in front of the government because the government doesn't provide them with the real money. Money comes from users. So if they are in the position to where they are forced to either fuck the government or the user they chose the government. As shown in the past

In fact, smaller private companies are easier to manipulate by the government. Than bigger corps. Wtf are you saying. Elon Musk is the richest person of the world. He can do and say whatever he wants 

I admire him for keeping up with tesla and spacex when nobody gave a shit putting his fortune at risk.  But don't get it wrong their ultimate objective is to make money. Otherwise they can not go on with other objectives.


How do you think space x is funding Starship?? They are able to do that crazy shit because they have falcon 9 which brings their money. Because they have a good BUSSINeS MODEL better than Nasa. So investors pout money into them . Elon musk keeps selling small portions of space x privately to raise money.

Nothing is free unless you sacrifice quality privacy or other kind of excancge so the company can keep working en growing. A company that doesn't grow just get overtaken by other competitors Hahaha do you think the boring company is funded by tshirt? How cute

True, is should attend more to the YouTube university. I missed some classes. I recommend you to check Karl Marx and his communist manifesto for moneyless economies. I can spoil you the end: it ends up with genocide If you don't have any data. Goodluck. There is nothing tinfoil here. There are no theories either. As I said earlier, If things get extreme, Signal founders may face the same fate as piratebay founders. But if you are not tied to money, if your product comes from a place of ideology, it becomes hard to buy you. It becomes hard to force you to bend. People will come out in support.   


Anyway, I dont care about government surveillace, they at least give us security and protection. There is no question of giving private companies the same right. Even if they don't mine data, they can still sell products and show ads. They have no reason to be so intrusive. Yeah, I am not saying what drives SpaceX, I said what drives Elon Musk is Passion, the idea of reaching Mars. Earning money is not the end goal of such people who are driven by ideas, ideologies & other things apart from money. 

Unlike companies like Facebook who only thrive on advertising to keep their platform alive. At the start, they did sell T shirts. Well, Karl Marx hasn't spoken about moneyless economies, He spoke about about Capitalism & Socialism. Moneyless economy ideas are popping from Sweden & other EU countries. 

Well, it's a shame that you'd think you know the end result of an idea or even the theory of it without even knowing the proper terms related to them. It shows, who's really shallow here. Socialism and moneyless concepts are no where close to each other lol. This ends up with the same question I haven't had an answer yet: who the F pays for the servers to mantain the app running? This companies are tight to money one way or other

Everything has a cost. A messaging app is not the same as a database of entries like  pirate bay Now you understand why there are some people that support trump. 

Some people like to make hero's out of public figures. Ignoring the bad, highlight the good. Like you do with Elon Musk

Keep drinking that cool aid. But sorry, elon musk may have a dream but their engineers will not work for free. So yes, making money is the ultimate goal of any company... Just open your eyes and think Donations. How big a donation do you want to be? Elon will be a trillionaire by 2030. Giving a billion dollars won't be anything to him. Why worry at this stage. The beauty is in to see how it grows and to not allow it to fail. When the time comes, people will support good tech. 

If you haven't donated to wikipedia, you won't know that feeling of supporting good tech. The possibilties are endless. Cryptocurrency? People donating their fortune..I would like to. There are many who would. Why care about it. Leave such concerns to the community. At the right time, they will support it. WhatsApp also used to be a company of 50 employees till Facebook bought them. What did they do? What are you talking about?!? Donation to crypto?  Hahaha I have made lots of money iwtth crypto. And no people doesn't donat money to crypto. They speculate. No miners does not computer for free, they take a cut.

Just saying people ""donates"" money to crypto shows you clearly do not know how anything you are talking about works.

You clearly have a very shallow knowledge of things. Can't argue with people not willing to read and learn You just stay in the shallow part .
How do you think whatsapp paied for servers and engineers? With finding. Who do you think funded the app? Capital investors. What do you think those capital investors want? Sell the app for money. So the ultimate objective of whatsapp was either subscriptions, ads or get adquiered

Now, do you want to do a 55 engineers company as whatsapp was once? But you don't want neither business model based on subscriptions, ads, or eventual sell? Find a viable way to do it and get famous You misunderstood again? people will donate in bitcoins & other crypto to Signal & other such communties. Well, if you can't understand my pov, you can move on. You make a lot of hurry to put your points forward without trying to understand what I say or feeling the depth of it. 

I can't expect much in this case, but Ill try my best to solve your queries. No offence. What can I say when somebody thinks people are ""donating"" to cryptocurrency? That was a sarcastic question but nvm. Wikipedia does it. I've answered your questions regarding costs & the scale of donations & operating costs. I think i'll move to queries from other users now. You can't expect good service from a donation model. 

Would you use an internet that sometimes doesn't let you play netflix? Yeah, I understand your concern, but the main purpose is Private communication, I don't think it is that expensive. It's just like Wikipedia. See that is the problem, people tends to think they have the solution and the solution is easier. 

That o ly confirms you are talking out of opinions based on scatter things you read on twiter or other places 

Do the effort and read a serious paper of how a messaging system works and how much could cost just for bandwidth Not speaking about things specifically doesn't mean one doesn't know about them. This post isn't an opinion lol. If you'd want to know.. Well, The average operating costs for such apps would be 250k/year. With Donations ranging from 50m by Brian & higher by other anyonymous donors which Moxie said earlier, it wouldn't be a big problem right now. Maybe 5 years later.. Really? What are your sources?

Well, wikepida which is just a website (do not offer voice calls, push pull notifications or other fancy stuff you may requiere) uses 91 M only for 2019 (go to wikipedia foundation and see the numbers)

Come to the reality. Technology is expensive. And it gets way more expensive and complicated when you go to scale (millions of users) Wikipedia is far bigger than Signal. Also, they have way more employees than Signal atm. So 100m per year as per your estimate. Atm, they have 50m users,
on Android alone. $1 per user/ year works well. Their lowest option is for $3. Many would just click on that. Good luck making people pay for a service that is free somewhere else.

There are more people than you think that doesn't care about ads. They just don't open threads on reddit Yeah, Many are willing to pay for an ad free experience. If people don't care, good for them. As for opening threads on reddit, if you can't get the significance of this post, then I can't expect you to understand the pov of all those users on Signal. Anyway, it's good to know that people have to brain-storm on finding better business models if they want to live ad free. I am ok with any of this business model. What I am not ok is demonization of social networks or adds."

Try to do your best and move your people to another messenger. Maybe not an option for you but try anyways Yes, I would be happy if everyone moved to Signal, but the neighborhood group and the school group and several social groups I'm in are all on Whatsapp, I am guessing the chances of getting them all to move are slim. What about Telegram? People talk too much shit about being insecure. It‚Äôs all about the way that app is built to offer users benefits. 
And Telegram for sure has more users (and contacts of you) than Signal. I tried Telegram months ago for unrelated reasons and found that I didn't like its interface, also it seems to have some privacy concerns of its own. you didn't like Telegram's interface? It's so much bether than WhatsApp'sü§£ü§£ü§£ Telegram doesnt compress pictures or videos, you can actually have your full quality pics sent to your friends and family THE WAY YOU MEANT TO TAKE THEM in the first place.

it's so much more secure. Groups can have many more members.
Secret chats. 2x audios. audios can be played in the background (meaning outside the app).

WhatsApp doesnt stand a chance against Telegram, for real.

Actually WhatsApp was better a couple of years ago. When they introduced that BS of stories they started to mess awful. now the privacy shit. Nah, WhatsApp is over for me"

WhatsApp crashes when restoring messages?;1;kwi8k3;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kwi8k3/whatsapp_crashes_when_restoring_messages/;0;"Hi, 

So as of late, I've been experiencing problems with my WhatsApp, moreso then I had done so previously. Basically, a few months back my WhatsApp message history would crash every now and then, but mainly when I would use the chat search function. However recently this issue has got much worse, and the message history would crash more regularly. I have tried to restore my messages through the backups both internally and via Google Drive, however whenever I go to do this, this preparing messages bar would only go to a certain percentage and then begin to fluctuate up and down. If I stop this preparing messages bar after the first time it drops, my entire message history would restore, however after a few minutes or a couple exchange of messages, the same thing would happen with it crashing. 

&#x200B;

I have moved the entirety of my image and videos folders over to a SD Card, believing that the storage may be the issue, however this doesn't seem to be the case as things of just as bad now. Just wondering whether anyone else has experienced these problems as well, and whether or not they had any solutions";2021-01-13 18:08:01;

I was thinking already for a long time to deactivate my Facebook Account, as I was only using it to check on news. Instagram for artworks and WhatsApp to communicate with  all of my friends and family. 

I've never used any other App like Telegram, Signal, etc...  


Yesterday, after days of reading about the upcoming changes, I finally deactivated my Facebook Account. I deleted the Instagram App on my phone and I am about to delete WhatsApp soon.

Signal is already setup and I told this my close friends and family members that I will be either reachable over iMessage or Signal. My close friends installed Signal to stay in touch with me and they told me, that they like it and might also swap to Signal in the future.

I'm distancing myself from Facebook and the other ones, as I don't need it and I do value my privacy. I have already, now I'm just badgering my friends/family/co-workers into joining, too. Convinced about 15 people so far, have no plans to stop. Yes but getting people to follow is harder in EU as there is less incentives. I don't have much of a problem with WhatsApp today but my fear is how they will change as time progresses, it's better to start getting people familiar with other options now then to try to move everyone overnight later. I have had signal and telegram installed for a while. I don't actively use them yet.

My dad finally installed signal and we've had one conversation there so far. But the family groups, etc have all remained on WhatsApp and I don't yet see any momentum to change that.

Lots of my WhatsApp groups have not moved and not talked about moving which is surprising a bit but I'm okay with it. In the end not much material has changed in the new terms of service if you don't speak to businesses, which I don't do.

I also still have Facebook. My usage of it has dramatically declined over the years, but it's still essential for some clubs and activities I participate in (or it will be when the pandemic is over), so I don't see myself deleting my account or the app.

I logged out of Instagram a year ago and I'm not planning to go back. I didn't delete my account in the end; there are some good memories there, and FB already has that data; but isn't collecting more.

I occasionally download my info from Facebook and WhatsApp to see what they have. WhatsApp is actually pretty minimal - it's just two metadata files with some phone numbers and group names. The value I get out of it far exceeds that amount of data. I did the switch and told everyone the reasons in a broadcast message in WhatsApp. I included a link to signal in my broadcast message. Initially my contacts in signal were just 2. I managed to migrate most of my contacts and groups. Most of them did the switch after explaining the issue. One person installed signal but will keep WhatsApp as they use it in their company. All in all, I will be deleting WhatsApp in a week. I want to know about this as well! Well done. You‚Äôve deactivated your FB account but you could go a stage further and *delete* it completely. 

You‚Äôve removed the Instagram app but you still have the IG account. You may of course be happy with this especially if you want to access IG on their web page. Good job. I did that as a first step because I had no time so far to save my pictures as there is alot of memories I dont want to lose.

When I have time I will have to go back to all those 3 and save everything up.

I will definitely delete everything! Yes, I tend to think photos can be a big problem due to sheer volume (remembering back to leaving Google... are they still around?). You'll obviously need to reactivate FB to access the photos."
I understand the metadata, but I want to ask about the video chats specifically. Can anyone else besides me and the person I am chatting with see the video chat or listen to it? Is the video stored some place? - thanks, sincerely an anxious girl üòÖ;1;kwg35t;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/v1ymjyqem3b61.jpg;2;[deleted];2021-01-13 16:07:20;"I'm not sure about the video calls, but what I do know is that Whatsapp is not worth it. If you read the policy, it has clearly mentioned HARDWARE LEVEL DETAILS including your Location and Network Details .... (they tricked many by saying shared location which is a feature where you share your location with friends).

I get it... Videocalls. I have the same doubt and worry. üòÖ I mean things people do... Anyways... What I can surely say is that it will share more of your personal and hardware level data to third party users who have their own policy. I dont think they save videocalls. They cant. See, the issue with whatsapp is its not open source or community based..... So even if they say end to end encryption.... No. Please dont trust too much. like these days because of COVID even my doctors sessions and job interviews are done through video calls that's why I asked. Unfortunately here everyone uses WhatsApp, so I'll just hope they won't make use of that yknow"

And protesting against WhatsApp might actually accomplish something, unlike protesting against Chinese govt. The 1.2 billion inside China that don't have access to any other messengers beside Wechat, maybe? Yeah well, perhaps it's because the new WhatsApp policy directly affects me since it's the one that I use This meme is specifically for Chinese People ! What Chinese apps do use?
In India they have already had a banwave of 50+ Chinese apps. because the chinese don't care about their privacy. they prefer to live than being freeü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  to be honest I don't know how they do it, I wouldn't live like that.

although, the world is becoming less free unfortunately. I fear that one day we'll have to fight for that (again, like people did couple of centuries back) It's not that the Chinese don't care about their privacy, it's because of how history ran its course and the communist party won the race to be the government of the day. The losing political party retreated to what is now known as Taiwan, and they have been fighting for independence ever since.  

Unfortunately for the common citizen in China, they have no way of voting the communist party out. They have no choice but live under constant surveillance. they do have a choice though: leave the f**k out of the country and go sonewhere where freedom is respected and cherished They could actually go through the **armed rebellions** route to win their freedom like other parts of the world and fight but they don't. Majority of the population is okay with the status quo and the rest are either afraid or don't care enough to try to change things.

The Tiananmen Square protests or the Tiananmen Square Incident, known in China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: ÂÖ≠Âõõ‰∫ã‰ª∂; pinyin: li√πs√¨ sh√¨ji√†n, literally the six-four incident), were student-led demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square in Beijing during 1989. The popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: ÂÖ´‰πùÊ∞ëËøê; pinyin: BƒÅji«î m√≠ny√πn). The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared martial law and sent the People's Liberation Army to occupy parts of central Beijing. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre (Chinese: Â§©ÂÆâÈó®Â§ßÂ±†ÊùÄ; pinyin: TiƒÅn'ƒÅnm√©n d√† t√∫shƒÅ), troops armed with assault rifles and accompanied by tanks fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square.

AFAIK, no ban is permanent. it only blocks account for 90 days. Try tweeting them they will listen if you have support ticket number. 

due to heavy usage they are becoming more and more strict about the ban and things there are chances they might not give you a clear answer. I talked to WhatsApp customer support and they refused to lift the ban on my number and we have an exam tomorrow and all my teacher talk to us on WhatsApp and now I don't know what is happening the sad thing is that most of the Lebanese people are getting banned because of this Watch Me ban and Whatsapp does not try and just give a thought about the people who are getting banned for no reason getting banned just because some hackers are bored and they decided to ban the Lebanese population's numbers off WhatsApp this thing should be dealt with ASAP some people use it for school and others for their businesses and now it's out of our hands that is the most awful thing and when we try to reach the support the only thing they say we have our reasons to ban you u broke the TOS and at the end of the email they say ""Responses to this email are not read"" wow well done Whatsapp you are the best how are we supposed to end this if the Whatapp support themself won't help us to be honest I am not ready to loose years of my work and media in Whatsapp chats it sucks now for me the support won't read any email I send neither any explanation of me not breaking the TOS but the hackers are or them  trying to get the suspension off my account tbh that is not fair at all so hope that Whatsapp take actions ASAP and try to get our numbers back activated and working because its time now any more delay all of the Lebanese population will have their numbers banned and those hackers have all the time in the world to ban us one by one until there is no more numbers to ban so actions need to be taken and I hope whatsapp support start to listen to their customers more yeah its call watchmeban and it spreads if you re in a group with an affected person  i think. they send u a pic and in 3 sec you re banned Yeah my number got banned after receiving a message saying ""watch me"",  whatsapp said that they stopped those bans a few days ago, but a new wave just started yesterday, yhe situation is fucked. Yesterday some accounts got unbanned and my number is one of them I think tge ban duration is about 2 weeks I think Ok thank u Yeah, now most of my class got banned, including me, but i think whatsapp is giving people their accounts back, cause i did.

Maybe it'll work?

Totally agree Had everyone just bought into BlackBerry and kept using bbm then we'd all be happy right now.. I believe bbm was doing most of that's mentioned by the OP Wait, whatsapp has pinned messages. They are called starred messages and have a star on them None of the features you mentioned are also available on Signal. There‚Äôs a reason for that - both Signal and WhatsApp use end-to-end encryption, which makes it very hard (and likely impossible) to implement the features you described. 

If you‚Äôre using an app with the listed features, keep in mind that they are likely able to read your messages and view your media, as are anyone in the event of a hack or leak. Absolutely true. I assume many of those choices were made in the interests of keeping the system simple and easy to use.  IMO, I think about 5 of those items would make the system worse for my use.  I don't want WhatsApp to start loading in features of reddit plus Facebook plus email etc. Pinned on top of the chat (or a group) While we can argue that WhatsApp encryption implementation has been criticised, and is it likely a feature that they implemented only after it was made popular by other apps. 

However, WhatsApp's backup mechanism on Google cloud, the fact that it saves photos and media in folders easily accessible from other apps and the way WhatsApp Web works, makes all this ""end to end"" encryption basically useless. 

I'd rather have client-server encryption than less or outdated features

https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-05-14/whatsapp-hack-shows-end-to-end-encryption-is-pointless

I know multi-device is not possible but I can't see why multi account, pinned messages, muting feature in large groups wouldn't be possible While it makes sense for some of them, like surveys for example, in other cases just doesn't. Cloud syncing and multi account for example. Those are features that now consumers ask for and basically take for granted in any other app"

How I got most of my contacts to move from Whatsapp to Signal;20;kwblbp;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kwblbp/how_i_got_most_of_my_contacts_to_move_from/;2;"I guess everyone here is aware about Whatsapp's privacy intrusions and its new Terms of Service from February. Signal Messenger is an open source, secure and non profit messenger service that does not use your private data. Moreover, it has most of the features from Whatsapp and is easy to use. Even Telegram requires acccess to data(lesser than Whatsapp but still)

I have always been apprehensive of apps using my private data for ad targeting etc. But when the new terms of service for Whatsapp were announced, it was the final straw. I decided to move to Signal messenger. I detail below how I got more than 90 percent(and counting) of my contacts to move to equivalent Signal groups. The major difficulty is in getting people to overcome their inertia to transition.

1. Share articles and make people aware of cons of Whatsapp and pros of Signal.
2. Create Signal groups of all your Whatsapp groups and start inviting/adding people. At first I was on the persuasive side for getting people to install signal by saying data privacy etc and as more people started doing it, I started more aggressive campaigning.
3. After some people had joined the signal group, I started getting those people to leave the Whatsapp groups. In the groups where I was the admin, I asked for permission on the signal group and started removing them from the Whatsapp group. This puts pressure on those who had not joined signal, and they too started switching. **Creating pressure and momentum is essential. Only when people see that others have started switching and leaving the Whatsapp groups, will they start moving too. This cannot be done if everyone joins signal and remains on whatsapp too.**

At the end of this, more than 90 percent of my contacts from active whatsapp groups have moved to Signal. The corresponding Signal groups are now active while the Whatsapp ones are turning empty as people leave. Hopefully, all would have transitioned to Signal by February.

Signal as the preferred messenger will only be succesful if people leave Whatsapp and join it. If they remain on both, Whatsapp will win. As Whatsapp/Facebook steps up its game of ads and data collection, Signal so far is our best hope of retaining our data privacy.

**I have no financial interests in promotion of Signal, just personal privacy interests. Only if people start using Signal, my self interest of a private messenger will be successful.**

Please share this around on reddit/twitter etc freely. Issued in public interest.

Signal people. Let's make signal the norm.   
1. change your profile picture in WhatsApp to ""Join Signal¬†¬ª
2. delete the WhatsApp app from your phone  
3. If you can, donate to signal  
4. As a ux designer, I'm about to contact their HR see if I can help even for free  
5. Apply step 1 and 2, to Facebook, messenger and instagram

Edit : clarification

Also, added benefits: less infinite scrolling, screen time, notifications, more focus, and you can still access Facebook, messenger, Instagram via your browser. Do it in private mode so tabs don‚Äôt communicate with each other cross site or so.


Everyone of us who joins and use WhatsApp against itself is a huge step forward Same in Indian express it‚Äôs not just WhatsApp. It‚Äôs Facebook and Instagram tooü•∂ This will only make people more suspicious. It‚Äôs like a pharmaceutical company running a TV ad that begins ‚ÄúDid you know that X drug *doesn‚Äôt* increase your risk of heart attack?‚Äù If privacy is in your DNA, why give users an ultimatum for account deletion? Hilarious that they‚Äôve included a link in a print advert! They really are panicking Then you definitely know Whatsapp did sthg wrong... Context? The ePrivacy directive drafted by the European Commission in 2017 has reduces the legal grounds for telecoms providers to use electronic communications metadata for other purposes or to further process the data.

Which is why these changes do not affect the European region (EU, EEA, and post-Brexit UK), and I'm not expecting to see anything like upheaval in this thread for EU users.

WA even has a separate page for the European Economics Area:

[https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/key-updates-eea?lang=en](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/key-updates-eea?lang=en) Wouldn't this kinda be false advertising? ""Don't believe what our own ToS say, believe this we're saying here on this newspaper ad!"" ‚ÄúWhatsapp respects and protects your privacy‚Äù

Is this a humorous column of that newspaper? ""Guilty conscience pricks the heart!"" WhatsApp do have a Monopoly is this sector. Only very few of us use Telegram or other apps, and that too for very specific reasons. There hardly is any competition. WhatsApp should feel that people have other choices as well. The Sarcasm of the whole decade Read what's written and then make up your mind. Do you even understand how end to end encryption works? When the matter comes to ad, Tribune never fails to earn. Did I miss something? True.. For context, print media is still very popular in India; compared to other nations. Yeah.. I am trying to convince my friends as much I can since 1 year.. The new misleading policies has now finally helped things to accelerate. Could you clarify 5. please? It almost sounds like you are saying ""delete WhatsApp and use Facebook""... ""The Hindu"" as well. Deccan Chronicle too Uh yeah, they're the same company. A print advert that's clearly a pdf and has social media buttons at the top is probably not a print advert. You are entirely correct except for the Brexit part. Facebook is now trying to move UK WA accounts to California. 

https://news.sky.com/story/amp/brexit-facebook-to-move-uk-users-to-california-user-agreements-heres-what-it-means-for-you-12164034 Finally a sane reply. Thank you for that. 

Somehow most people are saying ""Oh, they're writing X so it must be a lie, because otherwise they wouldn't be saying it."" What would they have to say then? Say the opposite so people will negate it once more? This isn't about end to end encryption, which only applies to your message *contents* - this is about all the other information, which isn't encrypted. Yes we do, you condescending prick. Do you really believe it's E2EE, since it's closed sourced?

What about [this](https://redd.it/ktss1w) ? What are they even gonna do tho. Print media is in a miserable state. Compared to other regional newspapers, The Assam Tribune has the least sensationalised news. Other national newspapers have also joined the race. Ask them about the new policies. 

Do they care that Facebook can read anything? 

No?

Ask them if you can read their messages out loud. Hahaha yes, I‚Äôll edit ! Facebook would be delighted to abuse that promise the requests are still encrypted, just not with ssl/tls, still a problem but not that critical You are wrong. Messages have been and still are end-to-end encrypted. The change only affects metadata about your communication (when, with whom, etc.), but not the actual content. Lol did you just copy a comment from the linked post? Still though metadata is powerful in it's own right. Won't make a big difference to most ppl but people who live in countries of lets say questionable democracy and human rights should definitely switch. > Messages have been and still are end-to-end encrypted

We can't truly know that, since WhatsApp is not open source and hasn't been audited. They can claim that, but without the ability to verify that it's pretty meaningless.

I can claim I've got the biggest penis in the world, but if I always keep my pants on you probably won't believe me. That metadata is extremely useful to build up your digital profile. üòÑ"

I kinda screwed up and I've been sending messages to the wrong number for quite a long while thinking it was my own (as a memo of sorts) (I've had like 1 number switched or something), and I'd like to erase the whole convo for the wrong number.

As of now, it seems the other number doesn't have whatsapp, but I am worried the owner eventually installs it or something and sees them. (I ain't telling you how weird and creepy it is to find some stranger you don't know sending audio messages of their singing LOL!), so any solution to avoid this cringy outcome and erase them ?? They have only 1 checkmark as of now, but they're old since I've been using them as a memo :).

What are some solutions ? I've heard about that trick of going back to a past date and erasing them but it doesn't work because my whatsapp tells me to correct the date. I've also heard about some strange crash messages that can apparently erase the other person's history. Any advice or trick on this ??

Telegram users are increasing drastically.;22;kvw48e;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/v5qkeqinrxa61.png;4;;2021-01-12 20:26:12;"And it's going to continue to increase... The reality is, while Signal seems to be technically better than Telegram, it's not ready for prime time yet... and it has a lot of quirks that your regular non techie folk will not understand... For example the fact that you cannot continue a conversation from mobile into the desktop client is already a major blow for most people... **I** understand the security factor but good luck explaining it to my parents... also the fact that it's VERY finicky with the phone numbers... If you haven't registered them in your contacts list following the very specific international number, you won't find them.

Telegram seems to have all these quirks figured out and it's just that much more polished... Sure, regular conversations are not E2E but if you need it, it's there. And the desktop client is just so much more polished... That's why most people are switching to telegram rather than Signal... I personally will be using both. I feel sad for WhatsApp üòÇ Yeah, correct. I'm currently using both Telegram and WhatsApp. But I have been using Telegram well before this announcement of new privacy policy. I really want to shift to Telegram, but still 70-80% of my contacts aren't shifting, so I am forced to continue with WhatsApp. luckily the majority of the people I interact with have already switched so I'm all set. for the rest of them, well... email, sms or download either telegram or signal. I tried to make everyone switch when facebook acquired whatsapp but had no luck so I came back. This time I'm taking a stand and will delete my account on feb 7, along with my facebook account that I haven't used in years and it's only serving as a login for a couple of non really too important sites."

I'm sorry if it's a stupid question, but where I live everyone uses Whatsapp instead of the good old SMS (SMS aren't free here in Spain).
That means your contacts, including employers, contact you through Whatsapp all the time.
I want to keep my Facebook private, so I only give my FB to those I trust since I only use it with close friends and family. 
Does the new policy mean that all your Whatsapp contacts will now know what your FB account is? My FB privacy settings are set so that nobody can just look me up.
I've been reading a lot about this and all the info I can find is that data will be shared between those platforms, but it says nothing about disclosing said info to your contacts.

Respect the people you talk or have talked to. He‚Äôs not a ‚Äúsheep‚Äù. Sheep are more noble than human beings. He‚Äôs just a misinformed person. 

It takes a shitload of time to read useless stuff about computers and applications I also believe that's partly why we are where we are right now. People are blindly, mindlessly and ignorantly believing BS. 
Advertisement psychology is a real thing. It may be beneficial for each and every one of us to do self analysis and try discover how many of our fundamental thoughts and beliefs are even our own and WHY we believe them.

I have started using iMessage with my friends that have an iPhone tho so there is a teeny tiny bit of improvement I don't get this sub

it's dedicated to whatsapp but noone here actually likes whatsapp? I'm not going to Signal, Telegram feels like a WhatsApp but with bots so I'm going to Telegram Haha indeed.

My android stopped getting popup notifications. I see no use for this app if I can't be notified whenever I get a message. I have to find an alternative.

See you on Signal lol I need to join the party. Add me. Just came here to say I switched my whole family from WhatsApp to signal this weekend and uninstalled whatsapp yesterday. I told my only work contact I switched, he said ""can I still text you?"" I said yep. 

I am very impressed with the improvements to signal since I first tried it . The one thing I will miss is ""live location sharing"" but I instructed my family to use Google maps for this feature for now. Already on it What is going on with whatsapp? Same. I'm in the process of convincing my family to switch over signal. There no way I'm keeping this shitty ass app. I just installed the app for my entire family. Told my boss and friends that I was moving and why.... immediately after I deleted my account and that‚Äôs the end of it. The people that I care talking to had their signal accounts... as for the rest of ‚Äúthe world‚Äù they can reach me on sms.... is not like we gonna be talking a lot This, we're stuck on WhatsApp here in the Netherlands :(. Everyone and their mom uses it. Nou ja zeg, all my close friends and family are on Signal! ;-)

You don't have to get everyone to change at once; just start with the people you talk to most and work out from there. I feel you, I am also in the Netherlands. But I started informing my contacts I will be deleting WhatsApp, and most people are surprisingly very flexible. Hopefully I can delete it soon once everyone is informed :) Everyone around me communicates through facebook messenger, but I haven't had a Facebook in years. My closest friends understand that to get ahold of me, you call me or come by my house, none of that messaging nonsense. 

 If you get rid of the app, the people that really care about being in your life will still be there. right? Bro, we use WhatsApp just because it's a standard. I wish we had more diversity in message services as we have in phone trademarks. I am honestly contemplating quitting for like 5 months or so until this shit ends I think its about ""topics on/about whatsapp"". Because no one actually likes WhatsApp, it‚Äôs a shitty app owned by a shittier company, but everyone in our lives use it so we basically have no choice Do you like Mark Zuckerberg? Not as secure. I think WhatsApp is better than telegram hifi üëå, I too made switch my family 1 year ago. but signal gained most of the attention now This new Privacy Policy thing I wish I could do that. I‚Äôm depended on WhatsApp for work so can‚Äôt delete it anyway. Also don‚Äôt forget to delete your account too (after exporting ur chats if you desire) otherwise Whatsapps new ToS will apply to your messages trough other peoples accounts. Now luckily that isn‚Äôt that important as of now as the AVG-wet prohibits for WhatsApp to do that, but it‚Äôs good to switch anyway so Facebook will have less influence. !remindme 3 weeks rejoin the sub As long as your contract does not state you need to have WhatsApp, they can‚Äôt force you I guess. I‚Äôm still in college so I guess it is easier to switch for me right now, but it is kinda annoying for the contacts of my sports association. Anyway, WhatsApp is not the only way to have contact so I guess I will figure out along the way!

I wonder why companies prefer WhatsApp over email? It is faster, but I can imagine employees have trouble relaxing at home when their personal WhatsApp send notifications with work-stuff. There is a 18 hour delay fetching comments.

Sorry in advance for how long it is... :)

There's a truly HUGE amount of talk about WhatsApp in the last few days, owing entirely to it's new privacy policy, which ""*is a huge violation of our privacy and OMG how could they do this?""*

But... No.. I don't think what's going on is that big of a deal, and I don't expect you to believe me without a solid explanation, which is what this post will be. Also please read the entire thing before you decide to vote or comment.

To start off, I took a look at WhatsApp's Privacy Policy. (Not the memes or posts, cuz those tend to exaggerate a bit)

I'll be going through each point and explaining them in laymen's terms.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gld86kyonua61.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f4da2167eabdbc24593127673ee86af9596daa3

When you create your Account you sign up with a phone number that's visible to anyone else. The profile name, profile picture, and about are stored on the server for fairly obvious reasons. If they weren't how would your contacts see them?

&#x200B;

[Unless a \\""friend\\"" takes a screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/hzvzh9yvnua61.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=57fa3953f1df6a9ec221b2e1622c01df561be4c8)

To be clear **WHATSAPP OR FACEBOOK CANNOT READ YOUR MESSAGES, NEITHER CAN THEY SEE YOUR MEDIA.** If you send a message to a contact, and the recipient is offline, the message has to stored somewhere temporarily until the recipient comes online. That place is the WhatsApp server, once delivered the message is deleted from the servers, and only exists on the two devices. This can be seen by sending a photo, deleting the photo from your gallery, and attempting to redownload the media. The item would not be available for download. This is also why you need to backup and restore your messages to switch to a new phone. The message are also end-to-end encrypted, meaning that Friend A and Friend B have a unique ""Key"", and the key is the only thing that can read the messages.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z5pspb06oua61.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=529ec3af2dc36ec55d654e34471dd79e4c386266

WhatsApp reads your contacts to discern which ones are currently using WhatsApp so that their name can be added to your ""New Message"" or ""New Group"", menus.

&#x200B;

[I can haz status?](https://preview.redd.it/5czg03igoua61.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=21dd1074866002267a71ac3dfd9ff9001552b324)

Since a status is sent out to your entire address book, the status is ENCRYPTED and stored on WhatsApp servers for the 23 hours that it is available.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9skepq3loua61.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8c0bcf18536ab89838dfd4071612535a69ad2a1

Here's another big misunderstanding. **WHATSAPP DOES NOT HACK YOUR BANK ACCOUNT, DESPITE WHAT DA MEMES TELL YOU.** In India, Business accounts have a feature to sell their products directly through the app. Therefore, the same way that Ebay has your credit card info, and shipping address, WhatsApp in India will store that info. If you're not in India, or have never used the feature they do not have your credit card info. Fear not.

&#x200B;

[Lemme put you on Hold](https://preview.redd.it/ksi1copvoua61.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ddc952b205741820c153c3eeffb7d59698c65cd)

This one is also fairly obvious. When you have an issue with WhatsApp and you contact them for help, they'd store that communication to help them improve their services. If they see a question cropping up frequently, they can add it to their FAQ page. If they get a complaint saying a customer service employee was rude and disrespectful, they have proof.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a59mvxb5pua61.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=6624b63bfc4ede73f2f19086d5a70ef7a60a2cec

This, my friend is a little thing called analytics. Let's say you created an game, with many different game modes. Wouldn't you want to know which gamemodes are played the most, and which gamemodes aren't worth keeping around? This is to improve their service and get an understanding of their consumers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b3evhxb5pua61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=abe64a9d940a0be5062ba9b81a3607e89a90fb62

If WhatApp is dropping support for an old version of android, they'd want to know how many of their users use WhatsApp, and rethink dropping support for that verison. They collect the app version to ensure that people aren't using a version of WhatsApp from a decade ago. The Mobile Operator is collected to ensure that people using ""Free virtual number"" apps can't use WhatsApp. About the IP address... when you go visit reddit.com, your IP address is seen by them, don't worry too much about that.

&#x200B;

[Your FBI Agent would Love to see this](https://preview.redd.it/568gd2v7pua61.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad3f27845f5cafc539c1c2d1174fa957a66b0c42)

Your IP address already has a rough approximate location. You also can use WhatsApp to share your location to a contact to tell them where you are, or just give directions to your house.

You may still be thinking, ""But Johnny, that's still a lot of things to know about me, I still don't want anyone to know that much about"". For that, there is a very simple solution.

**Take your phone, factory reset, and crush it with a hammer, then burn the remains. Take your hard disk, drill a hole in it, burn. Run a virus through the entire internet to remove all traces of your name making it as if you never existed. Buy a Nokia 3310, buy a used sim off a third party. Live your happy life privacy filled life.**

Because that's not the world we live in anymore.

Then this begs the question, **Why tf is WhatsApp getting so much hate then? Why is it just WhatsApp that's getting the cancel-culture treatment?**

The Ultimatum given by WhatsApp has attracted a fair bit of attention. Agree to our terms, or don't use WhatsApp. That's the deal. People actively involved in the cancel of WA, phrases it as ""If you don't agree with us, we'll delete your WhatsApp Account""

Phrasing matters people, Trying to get your point across with a few different words can change the meaning entirely. Also look at it this way.

[The installer for DeltaRune, By Toby Fox](https://preview.redd.it/gcrkpghhjua61.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=95c3124c8eb4b4cd7231d8aa73ca35131fbe43bc)

Anything service/ platform you are using at this moment, is because you agreed to the terms of service and privacy policy (I bet you don't read either of them, eh? XD)  If you don't agree to the terms, it's akin to saying; **Hello there king of foreign land, we are explorers from the South, we want to set up shop here, borrow some food and resources, but we won't abide by your customs and will eat the sacred kennyfruit in your faces. Deal with it. Also thanks for the housing for the night.**

Anything you use requires you to agree to these. And since WhatsApp's changing the policies, they can't accommodate to have two separate policies active at once. That's why they ask you to agree, or ditch. When you click ""Do not agree"" on a program installer, it just plain closes.

&#x200B;

Also another reason for the hate is...

He brought a lot of attention to the matter from his very descriptive and thought out tweet.

I'm not saying our boy Elon is wrong, but as for WHY this became such a big deal, this was definitely a factor.

&#x200B;

Of Course, I'm not going to tell people not to keep using WhatsApp, and not to download Signal. This post is so that you can make an Educated decision on what you're doing. Everywhere I look I see a post about how bad WhatsApp is, so I decided to make this. I, personally won't be deleting WhatsApp, and had been using telegram for a year now.

Also, I could be wrong about some stuff, I'm just a techie who read the Privacy Policies (for the first time lol). If i missed something, or got something wrong, leave a comment, and I'll edit the post.

Not sure which Sub to post this to, I'll keep it here, lemme know if you have other suggestions.

I'd appreciate if you could share this, I spent quite a while working on it, and cuz I'd like as much people to see this so they can get the full picture and both perspectives.

Already did that ages ago. Yet, I'm still alive. That is a very well thought out post, but the issue is much more simple. Facebook is not trustworthy and has shown themselves time and again willing to re-package and re-sell customer meta-data in any legal way they can. It's true Google, Microsoft, many others do some similar things, but the perception for now at least is that they handle the data more responsibly. For myself, I use every security feature I can to protect and ""opt out"" of additional data sharing in Google and Microsoft products, but I also find a lot of value in integrating those services.

Facebook offers us what? A glorified forum and contact list? The forced integration into Oculus products is what drove me to cut the cord with them. They're like an invasive weed  that tries to pop up over and over again and eat up all the territory in the yard. With the other services I can much more often opt out, or use other authentication methods. It's the difference in openness and business approach that makes all the difference to me. I'm primarily a Signal and Discord user now, and it's working well for me. Why are EU and UK exempt from this invasion of privacy? I am willing to pay a fee to keep my messages private I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Do you trust Zuck by his word? He lied to the national congress of his country. Why wouldn‚Äôt he lie to you? Freedom of choice vs. I cannot use YouTube because of the huge nagging screen forcing me to tap on a contract. I just use yewtu.be > Facebook is not trustworthy

Absolutely not Because the EU has its own laws regarding privacy that companies cannot ignore or overrule, unless they want to be banned and charged. Because their voices are louder, their governments have stricter regulations against being tech companies. They are not exempt. Difference in the EU is that when it's within the bounds of the GDPR (which it all is) you don't *have* to ask for consent. It's just obeying the law. Zuckerberg laughs... I don‚Äôt trust Facebook, I would not be surprised if they will do it even in EU and deal with it IF they get caught. What‚Äôs the worst that can happen? A few million fine and tap on the wrist? Remember Zuckerbergs smirks when talking to the EU parlament? It was pathetic Threema is your app. Signal is free though They are still private. Did you bother to even read the post? That is so clever. Every country should have privacy laws. happy cake day"

WhatsApp misleads their users time and time again. funny part is that the 2nd picture was literally in the link they provided to check the terms for ourselves;114;kvkhld;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kvkhld;38;;2021-01-12 07:37:41;"I don‚Äôt think whoever made that info graphic has actually read the privacy policy, which actually says things like it shares your friend‚Äôs phone numbers ( and your number if your friend has it ) *troubleshooting purposes* fuck that [Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1348839600333049857?s=09) Can we believe this ? I just read this in the privacy policy but the picture above says the opposite. Am I not understanding this correctly?

""Location Information. We collect and use precise location information from your device with your permission when you choose to use location-related features, like when you decide to share your location with your contacts or view locations nearby or locations others have shared with you. There are certain settings relating to location-related information which you can find in your device settings or the in-app settings, such as location sharing. Even if you do not use our location-related features, we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes to estimate your general location (e.g., city and country). We also use your location information for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes.""

Edit: sorry I just saw your second image. I heard a rumour that whatsapp still tracking user location information whether its disabled or not through IP addresses. If anyone know more about this please help Everything is fucking BS. ""we don't share information with facebook"" Oh really? I never gave facebook my phone number... It kept asking me again and again to provide them my number and I always refused... You know what happened shortly after facebook acquired Whatsapp? instead of asking me for my number, they started to ask me ""hey is this your number?"" and sure enough, it was. They've been sharing information with facebook for a long time now. The only reason I still use it is because of family who doesn't have other messaging apps Thats Why Location Services Should Be Off At All Times And A VPN Service Is A Must. Like ExpressVPN (Not Sponsored) I moved to Wickr seven years ago and I never looked back. It's built from the ground up with privacy by design. 

It's an end-to-end encrypted chat messaging service that uses layers of military-grade encryption, banks are now using Wickr to use as a communication and workflow tool. 

Also, it has contracts with the US Marine Corp and Air Force to use their Enterprise version of Wickr, which still has all the privacy and encryption layers as the standard Wickr Me app designed for personal use. 

It also gets good grades from the EEF every single year as one of the most secure messaging apps on the planet Once a thief is always a thief! if ads are so important for companies to earn money then why cant we all just install adblockers in our web browser in form of a protest? if we see no ads, how can they make money then?? What about the meta data? Data about my data is my data... yes. I didn't notice that they included that as well. I have no clue what they're trying to pull off here. maybe they don't share it with Facebook but still use it? wdym Trust zucks They collect the information when you open the location tab, to show you where you are, and the country where you stay so it can check with local laws and auto choose the country number so you don't have to scroll. That is not stored and anyone who thinks that is an idiot. Using the word ""tracking"" is kinda misleading. They check whenever it's needed, it is not stored or shared. apparently though ip address could only close it down as far as cities. but if they use WiFi networks to triangulate, then it could be more accurate to say less than 100m They don't need WhatsApp to get your number and they probably didn't get it from there either. Any of your friends/family (who has it on their address book) could have allowed Facebook to upload the information when using the Messenger app... 1 + 1 = 2, they can link it at some point to you by simple Facebook matching algorithm. tell them if you want to talk to me you can find me in signal. it isnt that hard to switch..u dont have to set up the whole profile or anything  like that, so its not that hard to move. should be using Tor or ProtonVPN people use mobile apps to access whatsapp and fb, not mobile browser

before you suggest vpn..not everyone is willing to pay for that adblockers also don't block tracking. They simply block the served ads. There's still a tracking and advertising id associated with you that keeps accumulating everything about your existence. And this can be used in many ways and even sold to other parties. I think the honest truth is that the Facebook Companies have a culture of complication along with a business model that makes money by selling data. So they grab everything they can without necessarily having a use for it. For example, my contact‚Äôs phone numbers need only be stored in an encrypted form in my account data. 

Facebook itself is a mess of over complication where most users make use of only tiny subset of features. They might be processing our data on device itself. For example: I sent my friend ""Gaming keyboards are so nice"".

According to what they are advertising, my chats would be encrypted and whatsapp might can't read it. But they would do one thing: the whatsapp app on my phone would just process the message using AI, and will note the keyword ""Gaming keyboard"", then it will just share ""gaming keyboard"" with whatsapp servers and facebook ad servers.

This way my exact messages aren't read by whatsapp but they just get important keywords. They changed the privacy policy to Facebook Company.

Yea so WhatsApp is Facebook, Facebook is WhatsApp now. Anything WhatsApp can see will be shared to Facebook. So if they have your location, Facebook has your location. Ok, so they posted a tweet about what doesn't change.
But they will godamn block out whoever doesn't agree to the changes, so I wanna know what kind of data WILL be transfered to Facebook. That means they can't use that information for marketing purposes in future? I am aware of that, but yet they started to ask me if that was my number shortly after acquiring Whatsapp... not during the 6 or 7 years I had facebook and have been using the same number. 

Maybe none of my contacts had my email listed on their contacts list so that's why facebook could match the name but couldn't confirm it was actually me there are plenty of free vpns available and the problem is the battery drain with them what if our keyboard data is being shared? what if whatsapp has a secret AI that reads people's messages when its loaded using WhatsApp Web cuz just click Inspect Element you can see messages in plain text.. What if they are reading our messages through the unencrypted backups we create.. so many questions but no one to answer.. so that location thing is confusing cause they literally said they collect location data on every user and if your location is on they will use your ip address to track your approximate location. 

in that tweet by them they said they don't collect 'shared location' which is what you use to send your friends your location which are part of the end to end encrypted messages. Your current location is not and will not be stored. Unless they change that in the future they cannot both legally and literally use that information for marketing or data collection purposes. The only reason they would save your location it would be for troubleshooting or for local laws that can affect their services (like china's end to end encryption laws) not just battery drain but they are even bigger threat to your data, device  and privacy than whatsapp That doesn't answer my question.

What will change next month ? how about protonvpn, they are ones who created protonmail, the e2ee email service.. they collect your device info, battery, contacts, location, who you're talking to and for how long and when with Facebook to personalize ads even more. 

I'm missing some more details but that's all I remember and next time I'm prompted on whatsapp again I can get a better read"

https://wabetainfo.com/official-response-from-whatsapp-about-terms-of-service/ Did WhatsApp silently change their privacy policy? I remember reading a line saying that they will know the groups we have joined, the group description and group photo. It's not there now in their privacy policy. https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kvkhld/whatsapp_misleads_their_users_time_and_time_again/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share I personally think people are overreacting
( plus EU citizens are protected by gdpr and won't even be affected)

What do you think? Is it trustworthy ? Well it might be overreacting, but accepting that Facebook may 'steal' private chats from anyone cannot be accepted. I was already doubting to delete my Facebook account, but this crosses a line. 

For them, they don't care about breaking some rules because their earnings are much more for selling the data then the fine they have to pay for breaking the rules. Private chats are end to end encrypted and use the signal protocol End to end encryption is a synchronous encryption type. This means that only the key is required to decrypt the chat. Since the code of Whatsapp isn't opensource, I do not know if they store my key on their servers and this scares me.

You ask what people think, I state my opinion and you downvote it. Next time don't ask anyone's opinion if you are planning to downvote it if you do not agree. They do not it has been proof checked by experts If I was an expert and someone would say: I give you 5 million dollars if you say something, I'd say something If you think like this, imo you can never trust anything. Signal is open source, who told you the code of the app is not different from the code they show you? You need to trust certain things (of course not blind trust) but I think they won't lie on things like this because they can go to jail. Plus independent leakers also checked it was true"

‚Ä¢ Encrypted Voice and Video Calls how is it more secure and privacy if whatsapp offers the same encryption standard all apps could do this so why trust anyone There has been no independent audit of WhatsApp‚Äôs use of the Signal protocol so you only have their word for how they have implemented it. If you use an Android device and backup your chats they aren‚Äôt encrypted and WhatsApp also collects a lot of meta data. It even collects location data if you‚Äôve turned off that permission using other methods like IP address. You really should only trust a system when you generate and hold the keys, and the code to do so is simple, open-source, and provided by someone other than the vendor of the rest of the system.

It's less convenient, probably more work for the user, but it CAN be done. > If you use an Android device and backup your chats they aren‚Äôt encrypted

Common misconception. They are encrypted at rest, which is different than end to end encryption. You can download your backup from drive and check for yourself. people always took their word for it, and it is well known that backups are not encrypted, almost every online service collects location data using IP address and other meta data, why people are only upset with whatsapp Signal doesnt collect meta data. While being free and offering all the same features as whatsapp. The key priority of Signal is user privacy, which is why the app doesn't collect any user data, as per the privacy labels provided on the App Store. The app only stores your phone number or contact information. When it comes to data collection, this is one of the most minimal apps out there. It offers more features, though.

Suppose I am person A sending a file to person B. Person A has successfully send the file and person B has successfully downloaded it  through his mobile. This means now the file has been deleted from the server.  
But person B access web WhatsApp and  yet he can download the file again.  
How is this possible, when the policy states that no file is stored on the server.";2021-01-11 20:38:37;It‚Äôs a flawed experiment, no? 2 waysi can think of that are possibly at play : Chat backups through iCloud or Google drive?

Signal is open source and telegram uses its own closed source unverified encryption. Signal is owned by a foundation not a corporation Privacy: Signal by far

Features: Telegram by far

so yeah, interesting question You don't get both with these options. Signal is better for security and Telegram is better for features. I have both xD Omg what the hell are saying. You don‚Äôt even know what Telegram is as I can see. 
Signal is better for Security (and everything is E2E encrypted, great but has limitations for features like the ones Telegram has). 
Privacy and features Telegram is far away better. You don‚Äôt need to share your phone number, lock app, lock with pin even Desktop app, exceptions for users who can see profile, last seen, forwarding. 
Telegram clients are open source and VERIFIABLE. MTProto es OPEN SOURCE, that‚Äôs how researchers years ago found a vulnerability and it was solved at MTProto 2.0. 
Signal is owned by a foundation that sadly is located at USA so it‚Äôs ruled by that government which doesn‚Äôt have the best reputation..."

Reddit, Facebook, Google, Apple, whatever you use. Just read the damn terms of service. I think this article sums up how much difference nothing makes either in WhatsApp or anywhere [whatsapp stories](https://mrf1nch.medium.com/the-power-of-influence-of-the-apps-we-use-9034f3b553af) Yeah.

Yesterday WhatsApp took selfie photo without asking. How did I know that? OnePlus 7 pro has special feature, camera moves out of the box in order to enable selfie photo. Today I deleted my account. Tomorrow my wife, mother and daughter will delete it. Fuck this shit, I don‚Äôt want to eat it. This why I am here. Bb WhatsAss nice comparison

btw does anyone know if u can undo the accepted new terms? I just accidentally tab ""Accept"" this morning... Good point. I have been using Signal and I was telling folks around me the other day that if you are sharing personal info, photos, etc already on FB, insta, etc. and you plan to keep sharing 'em, then moving from Whatsapp to Signal/Telegram doesn't make sense cause in a longer run it doesn't matter. Your info is already out there on different platforms. Having said all that, moving from Whatsapp will only do them good if their imp contacts also choose to do so. Signal, nextcloud, Ubuntu, protonmail, etc. 

Run away from surveillance capitalism Exactly this! People, btw WhatsApp encryption is better than telegram so stop using that argument when you don‚Äôt even understand it. Holy crap dude! Did the photo get stored in the phone? Like could you figure out where that photo went after it was taken? Might as well do the same with Google, Reddit and every social media you use then because they all use your data in the same way. We only give permission for phone call, Storage, camera, contacts. Other than that is crossing the line. If they are watching our chats or messages its ok because I don't care ü§∑. Before E2E anybody can hack our chats from whatsapp that's not a big matter. But pushing you to share all your information from your device other than chatsü§î. Hackers will do it without our permission and whatsapp will do it with permission. If you reduce your consumption of alcohol, your liver suffers less damage They're not even sharing things with Facebook, they *are* Facebook. Effectively nothing has changed other than that they own up to it and ask for your consent. That's only if you believe that WhatsApp still has intact encryption that hasn't been backdoored. Their code is closed-source so nobody can confirm that Facebook isn't running some murky bullshit behind the scenes. Plus, the app is incredibly easy to hack, judging by its track record. I haven't quit it yet but to say its encryption is better when nobody can confirm it is outright wrong. Reddit can be used anonymously without your actual phone number and Google is actually useful. WhatsApp is just a bad messenger. Why give them data if you get nothing in return? Signal has the exact same features with complete privacy. If I want to be an anonymous with google I will. Wtf, WhatsAss wants phone contacts of my friends, family, coworkers etc. they wants to know everything about my life. To have a possibility of influence into my life, lives of my family etc. and this fking influence will not be positive. They wants to fck me and they tell me ‚Äúor we starts fck you with all yours or we will block your account. Now they can fck themselves. Yes, they own your data from 2016 when Facebook acquired WhatsApp.

Edit: Corrected the post on advice of u/joep-b By chance, do you know [which encryption](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol) WhatsApp uses? By no means am I defending them, I'd just like to say that the encryption is probably the only part you can trust, because it's not theirs. Well that could be said for any company. WhatsApp uses signal protocol. But telegram uses an in house method. And only enforces E2EE in secret chats. 

Still, unless you are Snowden, or using the platforms to commit a crime, do we really care about encrypted comms? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You just have to read some of the latest Signal app reviews to see how many features are missing. So that's not sharing, they already own it. You can't share something with yourself.

Gmail doesn't share your data with Google, it *is* Google. Prime doesn't share your data with Amazon, it *is* Amazon. Messenger doesn't share your data with Facebook, it *is* Facebook. I know, but, again, it's only if we believe the encryption is intact. Unlike with Signal, which I trust completely. >Well that could be said for any company

No, only for the ones who have closed-source code. WhatsApp does, Telegram doesn't, Signal doesn't. > Still, unless you are Snowden, or using the platforms to commit a crime, do we really care about encrypted comms? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It is about privacy and I think 90% of you don't even care about it. Can you give what you talk, whom you talk to, i.e., your entire life information to a company which sells it to gain profit by showing you ads. This is inaccurate. Telegram uses end to end encryption for both cloud chats and secret chats. The difference is the default cloud chats are saved if you go to another phone etc. So they are on their servers. Secret chats are never saved and can't be backed up, they are secret. 

With that being said I prefer signal anyway Versus Telegram? Yeah. Versus Whatsapp? what exactly? Stories? who cares about that? Oh yes! üòÖüòÖ Even WhatsApp Founders and many great tech savy like Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, are advising everyone to move to Signal as it is open source, decentralised, and had the best end to end encryption technology in this world. Exactly, so? I mean I get it. But you can‚Äôt compare the dick pics you send unsolicited to your high school classmates, to the conversations that the richest person in the world have with other highly influential people. For the 99% of the population any half ass made communication platform will suffice. If you don‚Äôt like private companies profiting out of your data. Don‚Äôt use their products and services. Telegram cloud chats [are not end-to-end encrypted](https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/messengers.html). This means Telegram is able to read messages and media that are sent via cloud chats. You don't even know the P of Privacy. this is in such bad faith jfc Sure Julian"

I'd try to use both What will What's app actually share with Facebook? I skimmed through their new policy and it said it doesn't store your messages unless they're not delivered so I don't get what's the big deal? You are so smart! You are deleting WhatsApp because the new privacy policies involving sharing data with Facebook and you announce it on Facebook! Great job! got it. of course.  


 But who says I have the app They will share information that lets companies provide better services to users. So it is traceable back to your device. Sounds about right, right?

Yet, when Facebook acquired WhatsApp, they committed to not do what they‚Äôre doing today. Then they changed their mind and offered users to opt in or not and suspecting a probe by authorities they secretly put aside 77 millions dollars in case of.  Now they‚Äôre just doing it. Euuropean authorities wouldn‚Äôt have it si European users will still be able to use WhatsApp without their consent, but how would that work? A pop up every time you open WhatsApp, and sharing your data anyway.

Hiding 77m$ It‚Äôs not something you do if you‚Äôre doing an honest mistake and it‚Äôs enough for me to put those suckers away. 

Hiding behind small businesses while pressing them like oranges. that's pretty stupid of you to say. I mean you want to play smart ass but you're the most ignorant and stupid f\*\*\* face on the face on the earth right now:  


What if I share the news on Facebook that I was slowly moving to Signal and why so that others know where to find me?  


Dude I've seen stupid but you're a whole other kind. Bonus points: you're saying all of this on platform that belongs to the Chinese whom have a strong history of.. you know, not giving a single fuck about privacy. Same amount of fuck I give to your future comments to this so save your breath bye Hello? Are you okayy?? Just on case! I so much hate it when companies try to provide better service. Don't you? 

Has it the thought ever risen that it might be beneficial to the average user? You should Google it one day. Oh, no. Then Google will track you. Rather not have a good search engine. 

You might be right, but your argument if flawed. You still haven't answered my what the big deal is for average users. You sir are a legend <3 Dude, you killed him appreciated ! thanks ! Facebook account is next in my list anyway ! thanks ! Dude, you‚Äôre being very stupid at the moment.

¬´¬†I skim through and it seemed ok¬†¬ª and you believe what you found. 

11 days Into 2021 and nothing is learnt. Amazing. All WhatsApp has to do is securely send messages and calls to people. That's it. It's a simple thing. What vague ""better service"" can it provide with my battery info, physical location, IP address, user activity, all of my contacts, my on-app time, and whatever else that it hasn't already in its 12 year existence, including 6 under Facebook's control? 

No one's buying this bullshit argument. 1. I never intended to, I don't have to. This post regards me. deal with it.
2. Look it up yourself. Such a complex topic doesn't immediately ring a bell but if you just choose to read, you'll get how  lack of privacy may undermine modern democracies and is a common denominator to any dystopia you can think of. It's not about confidentiality but about control over my data. 
3. we can agree disagree, the problem lies with you waiting on others' answer  without which, you still form an opinion. Skimming through isn't enough. If Facebook, with their reputation tells you to trust them over something that's been disputed for 7 years, where they repeatedly breached privacy and found guilty, would you do it?
4. So if you're looking for answers, refer to 2 So you don't want to use Whatsapp because of the new policy, but you don't actually believe that policy is true. Then why bother reading it at all? 

I wonder what you think you learnt the last 11 days, because I've seen more reasons to go with Facebook than with so-called neutral platforms. Have you ever considered how these companies work? They need data, lots of it. 

Data is how they improve. And yes, then need to know your location and IP and battery level and all that information, so they know what region to improve their coverage, perhaps find and block malicious networks and assess if they should build a better experience or focus on less battery usage.

Yes, they could infringe your privacy when they link it to you as a person. But seriously, if you think the big five don't already know where you are, you need to wake up. If you're that paranoid, just cancel your phone and internet subscription. You talk like an opinionated 14 year old on the internet Dude, you‚Äôre stupid and naive and I don‚Äôt have time to waste. Byyye idiot Lmao. WhatsApp doesn't have ""coverage."" You use data or Wi-Fi. That has zero to do with WhatsApp. The app works just fine already with its existing policy. Not sure how they plan to improve ""with all that data"" when it won't even be legally permissible to collect in two dozen EU countries. 

You're either this blindly stupid in thinking tech companies mine your phone for better services or another apologist shill. You talk like I asked for you ineffective fact-less opinion

Go join your qanon friends and hangout on the Capitol. Getting real emotional for someone who really doesn't care It‚Äôs not like I wrote an article for which I had to dig up every single time Facebook lied and got caught.

I want to store my WhatsApp data seperate from my WhatsApp. WhatsApp has a feature called Exporting Chat. You can export your all data on a chat on a .zip file.

There's no way Whatsapp's not sharing your private convos.;70;kujuir;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kujuir;16;;2021-01-10 21:31:35;"I have another explanation that is much more likely: 

## It's your keyboard, not Whatsapp listening!

Especially if you use GBoard or the standard android keyboard all your words go to google for better next-word-prediction.... oh yes and ads ofc. It‚Äôs bias. You would‚Äôve ignored the ad had you not had had a discussion about the product just before it. Discuss 10 different products on WhatsApp and check how many show up as IG ads. Based on few of your replies, it is very much possible that you *did* get the ig ad because of your WhatsApp message. Lmfao at the people saying this is *strictly* bias. Naivety like that is what allowed these corps to become a comms Oligarchy. Such naive people don‚Äôt realize the endless quantity and diversity of ads circulating on any social media platform. Instagram has millions of distinct advertisers who have a targeted audience. IG literally cannot show you ALL those ads, nor will they gamble with whose eyes see what. They are not in the ad gambling business. Ads are the main way thee tech corps make their money. What *we* call ‚Äúadvertisers‚Äù are what they call ‚Äúclientele.‚Äù

The naivety here reminds me of the people who would scream and shout at YouTube for  ‚Äúhiding‚Äù new videos of subbed channels from their homepage. These are the same people who had subbed to hundreds or thousands of active channels. It is literally impossible to show you everything you want in a limited screen-space.

IG is NOT going around showing random ass people a specific watch brand hoping it will interest the viewer. They also cannot show *everyone* that one ad (it is simply impossible due to their business model). I know this because I have studied digital marketing. It is nearly certain that this ad was shown to you because IG somehow knows you are very likely to be intrigued by it, for whatever reason. Now, if you are following any similar niche watch pages or groups on IG or any other platform, then you cannot pinpoint the blame on WhatsApp.

However, if this is the first time you ever mentioned that brand in any shape, way, or form, then I recommend deleting the app, because it *is* and *has been* spying on you. There is zero reason to trust WhatsApp‚Äôs previous privacy policy given the multi-billion dollar privacy lawsuits Facebook has been entangled in.

Another thing to note is that if you even whispered that brand name around your phone or a voice assistant device including a firestick tv remote, it could be any of those different tech products/services collecting and selling your privacy. Another thing to consider is that your phone itself may be tracking & flagging the words you type into it. For example, as I type this comment before clicking ‚Äúpost,‚Äù my privacy is already compromised. Even if I cut all the text and decide to not comment this, I may get an ad for a Firestick soon.

The biggest issue is figuring out who/what is NOT spying on you since 90% of the tech around you already is and their data collection is covert as fuck. It is easy to get lost in this digital matrix and *they* know that. There is no definite way for me to tell if Whatsapp is the culprit for that Ig ad. Nonetheless it is entirely possible.

In this digital matrix of smoke and mirrors, the best bet for maintaining privacy is either boycotting *all* modern tech or preparing yourself mentally to both assume and accept that all of your devices/services are spying on you one way or another, despite their privacy policy. If you want selective privacy, then you must learn and master the ways of the streets aka the art of privacy employed by ‚Äúcriminals.‚Äù On numerous occasions, I've had specific items show up on ads the day after having discussed them on WhatSapp.  Unique, niche, tech industry items, that would never normally be shown, which appeard after a *verbal* mention in a WhatsApp chat, the very next day later.

I can guarantee I would have noticed these items being advertised beforehand, as they are so niche and specific application, that there is no way they would be randomly just sent to me based on my basic demographic and job.

And they have appeared the day after their first, singular, unique mention in a conversation. It's entirely possible the keyboard is listening, but this was based on a messaged I simply replied to on whatsapp. I never actually typed ""Oris"" anywhere. +1 this, Gboard by default sends listens for analytics to be used as advertising data. Google does collect what you type, but do you think Google shared that data with Facebook? I agree with u/ameyms here. This is a common misconception that makes people think their conversations are being listened to by google, etc. 

The fact is, you don't notice most advertising you see. But if a friend mentions something to you in a voice call on your android phone, then you see an ad for that thing the next day, it's not because google listened to you. It's because the ad was always there and you just noticed it this time because you heard your friend mention it.

The same is true for WhatsApp messages. I can't say if Google or Facebook use your message content for ads though. Has anyone tried an experiment with FB messages or SMS on a google phone? I know for sure google reads my emails and advertises to me based on that. I disagree. I never ever talk about Oris, and the one time someone else mentions it, I get an ad the very next day. >Another thing to note is that if you even whispered that brand name around your phone or a voice assistant device including a firestick tv remote, it could be any of those different tech products/services collecting and selling your privacy. Another thing to consider is that your phone itself may be tracking & flagging the words you type into it. For example, as I type this comment before clicking ‚Äúpost,‚Äù my privacy is already compromised. Even if I cut all the text and decide to not comment this, I may get an ad for a Firestick soon.

Some very good points.   I may be having a WhatsApp voice conversation on my phone, but likely my Nvdia Shield remote, and OK Google itself on the phone both listening at the same time...   All as bad as each other these days. You know what I'm talking about! The others commenting are going based off what's been feed to them. And as a semi scientific experiment, you should talk about 10-20 different products on Whatsapp and see how many of those show up as ads on IG Survivorship bias, to be more specific. The logical error of concentrating on the things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. I am saying you probably see hundreds of ads on IG that are unrelated to your Whatsapp discussions. I just spammed Oris on my chats and nothing shows up about Oris.

Your cake is a lie. LOL"

Elon Musk said that starting February 8th WhatsApp will be able to access all the information in your phone, including conversations, passwords, bank information (only info, can't do transactions and CC# is encrypted). 

So from what I understand WhatsApp will be able to see how much money you have in your bank account and your last CC transactions, so they know what kind of stuff to advertise to you better. 

And your convos they can see what you say so they know your interests.

(no sim card in this phone, just the google voice number). 

Facebook might put 2+2 together and realise the same ""stranger"" is still contacting the same exact people (as it has access to contacts lists) and still might develop a profile around you, but if you use this phone with a free VPN and it's not your main phone, at least the phone hardware data and IP won't be blasted out there. 

Facebook profile recognition is good though, it probably will put two and two together. Who else would be talking to your S/O, friends, family, and college groups besides your evil twin brother lurking in the shadows? I plan to install whatsapp in a emulator environment (any hints for unbloated android emulators that run on windows are appreciated) and export my chats|data to a readable format. Using Whatsapp Business allows me to set ""away messages"" that message the ppl with some signal, sms, phone or email advertisement. I will definitely look into whatsapp for some time being but it will no longer be a part of my mobile device as soon as I have my setup running.

As I have crashed my phone screen a few months back and didnt want to move WA to iphone just to move it back to an another android device I've had a few months where I checked whatsapp web a few times daily. Maybe its the pandemic, but in general I could work out plenty other solutions. Groups are a thing, though, and may be for some time. Basically, it uses phone numbers as the primary key.  Installing the app gives it access to your address book, and they can look at that to see who your friends are and their phone numbers.

Supposedly it uses the same encryption algorithm as Signal (Open Whisper Systems), but it's closed-source, so who knows what it's scraping from your phone. Export, then leave and delete old/dead chats that you don't use. Even if there are quite a few chats you still need to be in, limiting the amount of historical data that Facebook/WhatsApp has on you is probably good. If anyone you speak to has a Gmail address, start messaging them on Google Hangouts. use VPN If you still use it You can't New privacy policy changed [nothing much.](https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/) I run [Android-x86](https://www.android-x86.org/download) on Virtualbox and was able to get whatsapp installed there.  But then it prompted me for a phone number, so I didn't register it there. that doesn't mean it is all right to keep using it. I actually used whatsapp before so I am already registered, just want to shift the urgent communication and hopefully the groups will disappear over the time. Until they do - I guess I fire a raspberry pi for sth like this. Could do some additional things in the meantime."

The YouTube link share problem;15;kuiuc1;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kuiuc1/the_youtube_link_share_problem/;6;"**TL;DR at the bottom**

I've seen a number of posts over the last couple of months about youtube link previews not working, and today I ran into the issue myself, so I decided to investigate and figure out what was going on. As for myself, I have a technical background in computer science, but I am not using anything like a decompiler or source code to do this investigation. With some computer knowledge you should be able to follow along with what I did and even replicate the findings below.

To do this investigation, I started bout by investigating how the WhatsApp link preview works normally. I consulted [this answer on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19778620/provide-an-image-for-whatsapp-link-sharing) to learn about the basics and created a simple html file on a personal website to check that it worked, which it did fine.

I then used \`curl\` to download the html behind a youtube video and I started investigating. (All following commands were run on an ubuntu linux server):

    curl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ > yt.html
    wc yt.html
    67   5062 669732 yt.html

The first thing I noticed is that the html is quite large -- over 650kb, or about 2/3 of a megabyte! I also noticed that the size changed by a few bytes every time I repeated this, so google is not serving the same content every time. I immediately suspected that maybe the large size of the html was causing the problem -- perhaps WhatsApp was not downloading so much data to create a link preview.

To test this hypothesis, I took the small test file I had created and added a bunch of Lorem Ipsum to the body of the file --  I added hundreds of lines of Lorem Ipsum -- and checked, and I only had about 60k. So I went back, made mega-long lines of Lorem Ipsum, and copied it until I had a total size of a megabyte. I then tested link previews again using this large file. To my surprise, the link preview still worked! So it wasn't file size (but we'll come back to this later).

I started looking at the html of the file itself. It was clearly machine-generated with very long lines, so to get a sense of the file, I cleaned it up a bit by splitting each set of tags onto its own line. What I noticed is that there's a lot of JavaScript embedded directly in the html itself. Like, hundreds of kilobytes of JavaScript. Seems crazy, but that's what I saw. So I removed the Lorem Ipsum, copied a bunch of the JS from the youtube HTML over to my test file, and tested again. But once again, the link preview rendered just fine. So it wasn't the JS either.

After scratching my head a while, I noticed something else: In my test page with the megabyte of Lorem Ipsum, the metadata that WhatsApp looks for in the shared web page was at the top of the page, in the `<head>` element. But in the YouTube HTML, the meta tags were in the body. In my limited experience, `<meta>` tags in the body didn't seem right. So I looked it up. According to [this answer on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1447842/what-happens-if-the-meta-tags-are-present-in-the-document-body), `<meta>` tags are only allowed in the `<head>` element, and not in the `<body>` element.

To verify that this was indeed the problem, I modified my test page, removing all of the Lorem Ipsum content and moving the `<meta>` tags from the `<head>` to the `<body>` of the HTML page. And sure enough, this caused the WhatsApp link preview to stop working again. So there we have it -- YouTube is producing **invalid HTML**, and this is causing the link previews to not work properly. [Google has been known to ignore standards at times](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1038191/why-does-the-google-homepage-use-deprecated-html-ie-is-not-valid-html5), though this looks more like a silly bug than an explicit choice.

**TL;DR: YouTube is producing invalid HTML with** `<meta>` **tags in the** `<body>` **instead of the** `<head>` **and this is causing the WhatsApp link previews to not work properly for YouTube.**";2021-01-10 20:36:00;"Thanks.

Thats why, I want to delete our chats. Now I want to know, will deleting chats delete our chats history from both sides? Meaning, Will she still be able see the messages i sent to her, after I deleted the chat by clicking on ""Delete Chat"" option?";2021-01-10 18:45:53;"She will be able to see a warning that message was (sent and) deleted How long ago?  
WhatsApp stores messages in their servers until it reaches the recipient and if the message doesn't reach the recipient for 30 days from the date of sending it gets deleted from the server and doesn't reach the recipient. Will she be able to read the previous messages? Almost a month ago. Maybe 20 days ago. No. Message content is deleted. Only warning/info message Oh okay, then there's no way to delete it for her. 

If the message doesn't reach her phone for 30 days after you sent the message, it won't reach her (cuz WhatsApp will delete it from their server) Also, I have posted a little bit more explained post about what I exactly want to know. Please check that post. Will it be Permanently deleted and none of us can read that again? If you deleted it from your phone and she doesn't receive the message by 30 days, yes. I sent it on December  2nd I checked it now. The message still hasnt reached her. So now if I wan to permanently delete the message. what should I do? Oh okay, since it's been more than 30 days she won't receive the message or any notification that you sent the message when she starts using WhatsApp again. 

And you can just delete the message from your phone too and both of you won't see it again. By clicking on ""delete it for everyone"" wont it have a text ""you deleted the message""? Wait if you sent the message on Dec 2, you shouldn't be having a ""Delete For Everyone"" option and there should only be a ""Delete For Me"" option currently. Anyways she won't know. Thank you very much! Np

Bear with me, this is a long explanation.

When you send a message to someone it first goes to the WhatsApp server and from the WhatsApp server it goes to the recipient. Once a message has been delivered, it no gets deleted from WhatsApp's servers and only exists on the sender's and recipient's phone.

If the recipient is not online, the undelivered message is held in WhatsApp's server until it can be delivered. If the message is undelivered for thirty (30) days, the undelivered message is deleted from WhatsApp's server. And the recipient won't receive the message or any trace of the message being sent. The message will only be on the sender's phone.

I deleted my whatsapp moved to another application of my choise, AND also deleted my facebook account cause I realised in 2021 it is nothing more than a fancy birthday calendar for me.  I sent an email to [support@support.whatsapp.com](mailto:support@support.whatsapp.com) asking revoke acceptance for my account. Will let you know how it goes.

edit: it might be because my account was tied to another number with another country code before I got this new number in 2017. Is this the case for you as well? I should be protected by GPDR laws, if I am not mistaken.

If I delete it and sign it back, I will lost all group chats, right? Or am I going to be added automatically with empty chats? It was my understanding that the new policy will not be in effect in the EU and UK. I read such an announcement by Whatsapp, it has also been widely reported in the media, e.g.

https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/whatsapp-says-european-users-do-not-have-to-share-data-with-facebook-1.4452435 > it might be because my account was tied to another number with another country code before I got this new number in 2017. Is this the case for you as well?


Yes, my account was tied to another number and I moved from my old number to the new one. Although, it was unnecessary because I changed from Android to iOS, all my chats were gone (but I was in the groups anyway) I noticed this too, I've been living in Ireland for a while but my account was originally registered with an American phone number, I think that's why I got the agreement. Upsetting. Whatsapp is saying that there is no data sharing in the new policy for EU users. At least this is how it is being reported. What makes you think the new data sharing agreement is not GDPR compliant? If they provide services in Europe they need to be GDPR compliant anyhow. 

GDPR does not forbid companies to collect your data, it requires them to inform you and get your consent (hence the new agreement) and it makes companies delete your data upon your request. >I should be protected by GPDR laws

You are.

FB has already been fined once for trying to do this a few years ago (the EU Commission fined them 110 million euros for sharing data between FB and WA, in 2017).

And right now, several EU countries are bringing new lawsuits against FB for such practices. Ireland in particular since Euro FB headquarters are located there.

It is illegal for FB to merge WA data with FB data, in Europe. And to drive the point home, there is also legislation forbidding them to export data out of Europe to the US (which would have made them able to do it there).

Of course, FB being the slimey entity they are, now that Brexit is done, they are shifting their UK user base to California.

FB might still be doing shit out of sight. But EU directives are plugging holes as fast as they appear, and individual EU countries are going after them, too. I am not familiar with all those concepts, but that law should protect me, right? So, if I change my decision, i.e. I don't want to accept their new privacy rule, I should be able to do that, or not? Yes, you're free to delete your account and they are bound by law to delete your data at that moment.
As a result, when you create a new account later it will be empty and clean."

Never trust anything that comes from Zuckerberg & Co. The only reason I‚Äôm not a user is because my phone number got banned. I use signal now to send files between my Note 20U and my iPhone.

Whoever actually cares, just has to close his/her account, hence no longer being an user... Correct. as of 8 Feb, you'll be 100% correct as of now, it is not 100% of all users That's a weird way to look at it and not really true: 

What about inactive users? What about people who care about their privacy but still **have** to use WhatsApp for business reasons? > as of 8 Feb,

the company says that the privacy policy deletion simply reflects how WhatsApp has shared data with Facebook since 2016 If they would care, and particularly businesses, would look for other options and use them.

There are options, that is the thing. You can choose. If you choose to stay, either you don't care as much as you say or simply is not that important.

Of course, this is my subjective opinion.

And about inactive users, well, they are not actually using and they won't be accepting the terms since they are not using the app, right? If they don't accept them, would they accounts be removed or would the terms be automatically accepted?

I think probably neither option and, if they ever go back to the service, would be sked to accept whatever terms are in place at the time."

Personal thoughts and questions (mostly focused on Privacy):

*  I have zero faith in Signal, given it's run by the WA Founder who pretty much confessed to lying to EU/antitrust authorities ***afte*****r** he was no longer bosom buddies with Zuckerberg. (Also the Elon Musk endorsement is a huge skepticism-booster for me.) 
* Any idea why it costs more to buy Threema from Threema than the App stores? Any opinions on the people behind Threema?  
* How does the Telegram owner earn money if he's not extracting our privacy and turning our lives into products like WA does?

I want to start making informed decisions  to stop my self from being turned into a product - and a tool to enhance corporations' prediction game, which is changing the course of human experience as we speak. 

We've experienced the consequences of this in politics, health, public opinion. 

It is up to all of us & the tiniest choices we make - such as choosing a chat app - to stop this from being more pervasive than it already is. 

Any thoughtful perspective will be truly appreciated!";2021-01-10 13:14:25;"My thoughts on telegram:

- it'll probably monetize by providing business functions. Already now you can use chatbots to serve customers, write bots that interact with chatrooms. Telegram will, if successful, become more of a platform than a simple messaging service. I could imagine they will try to introduce services, that are interesting for business and earn money by that. Imagine hotlines as today. You could handle that via a telegram chatbot and eventually route requests to real persons.
- It's open source. But that alone does not guarantee, that the same software will be installed on your phone. That's why telegram invests in reproducible builds. This enables anyone to verify if what's installed on your phone is the same as published as open source code Don't just ignore XMPP. Imho this is the best alternative. It's a protocol that works just like email so there's no centralized server, you can even host your own. So you can be sure everything's in your own hands. Telegram is the best of all Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but only the Telegram client apps (ie what the end user, like you and me, uses) are open source. Their server code and encryption is closed source and worse their encryption is proprietary (which is not so great from a security pov).

Signal on the other hand has all of their software open sourced.

WhatsApp uses signal's encryption.

My personal opinion:

- Signal use it if you want absolute privacy and can live with a sparse featureset
- WhatsApp use it if you want decent privacy about the content of your messages but facebook gets to know your meta data 
- Telegram if you want okish privacy, want an app that is a bit more refined than Signal and trust Russia/Dubai more than Mark Zuckerberg

Either way, dark times as an end-user Very insightful. Thank you! Wonderful. Will research. Thank you! Thank you. Any thoughts on Threema? A messaging app is as useful as the number of contacts you have on it. While I like most aspects of threema, I am not paying 3 or so euro to not have anyone on it, which is what I believe many are thinking, which in itself perpetuates the problem.

I'm all for a paying if it means I get a proper service but I'm not going to pay to get an amazing app that I can't use because all of my contacts use something else. So I guess as long as they don't change their business model to something like whatsapp used to have (free for a year and paid afterwards), I don't really see it as an alternative.

But then again, take my words with a grain of salt. If I really knew how to do it properly I would have my own messenging service x-D That's a good model - one year free, followed by a lifetime fee. Maybe they don't want to expand?... Thank you for sharing your experience and opinions!"

Peace!";2021-01-10 05:10:11;"Good job, you‚Äôre not the only one deleting this shit Telegram is fully bloated with features that most people don't even know exist. I am an addicted telegram user. ~~(Active in telegram anime communities)~~

Signal is best for general purpose. I have tried Signal and it is really good for general public. The reason why I am saying that is, you might really hate telegram if you are someone used-to using whatsapp because of following functionalities-

1. Both parties can delete each other's messages. (huge turnoff for many people, while it does not bother me, I still suggest you use signal)
2. Forwarded messages have link to the profile of person it is forwarded from.

If you talk about security then arguably
Signal is better because Telegram can theoretically use your data because it is stored on their servers.

[Telegram FAQ](https://telegram.org/faq)

[Signal FAQ](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/sections/360001602832-General-FAQ) Signal This is really stupid, since it's missing the option of, ""I really don't care and am sticking with WhatsApp because everyone else is."" Whatsapp messages are end to end encrypted so no one other than the sender and receiver can see messages. Facebook is asking for access to app meta data like statuses and contacts. Facebook probably already has your contact info. This whole thing is over exaggerated. If you don't use WhatsApp pay (by choice or because it isn't available in your country), no need to worry about bank account details or transactions being shared with Facebook either. For most people, this policy has very little to no impact Signal is much more safer because it uses E2EE and doesn't force you to back your data up on third party servers. best option for people who prefer security

telegram is not safe at all because all you chats (except for secret chats) are stored in telegram clouds and it uses its own encryption method which is not approved in the professional area, but it has a lot (and I mean a LOT) of cool and  functional features. you should decide based on your needs. best option for people who don't care about their security and just want cool features and fast connections. if telegram servers get hacked all your information is up for grabs but using signal is not as fun as using telegram.

whatsapp is safe, only in keeping your chats secure between you and you're other end of the conversation because it uses E2E too, until you back you or one of your peers back their data up. that way the whole conversation between you and them is stored in third party servers. but it leaks your metadata (your number, status etc) to facebook. note that whatsapp doesn't share your chats with any third party platforms (unless you back them up). if you are in group of 10 people and one of them use back ups all your chats are stored in 3rd party servers and are not secure. Threema all the way! (even though userbase is very limited) [deleted] Google Hangouts. The Telegram app on desktop or web does not require a phone after setup. So you can send messages from a computer even when your phone has no reception. It is for this reason I have been using it over What'sApp for a long time. I think Signal is the same as What'sApp in this regard. I probably would go with Signal if it wasn't for the fact that chat history isn't syncronized between devices, and also only backed up to local storage. (correct me if I'm wrong). Telegram Signal Telegram can read your messages. WhatsApp cannot. So don't switch to telegram. [deleted] Telegram non secret chats are neither private nor secure as they are not end to end encrypted.  So by default signal is way more secure, although it has way fewer features than telegram. Signal is the obvious way forward from default privacy standpoint, but few know of its existence, while Telegram is somewhat popular, especially amongst thugs, who believe in its safety :) I love the features of Telegram and I just switched to using it. I am a personalization addict and I love tweaking every little aspect. Telegram is, objectively, much better than  WhatsApp and Signal in this aspect, as you stated. That is exactly why I switched to Telegram. 

But again, as you stated, Signal is the best for general purpose. But, apart from the settings menu, Telegram is easy to use too. I want to hope that people do not come to Telegram and say ""This is confusing."". End to end encryption is not the only way to secure data. It really isn't the be all and end all of security.

In fact it makes features such as having a website, desktop app and multiple clients all being able to see messages very difficult. End to end encryption is the reason whatsapp web has to connect to your phone to read messages, because only your phone has the key.

Yes its a nice feature but there are lots of ways to still respect privacy and secure data that doesn't require clients to own the keys. When does evil win?

When good men watch and do nothing. Which is why everyone needs to ditch both! Exactly, they were already taking stuff, they just made it clear what they were taking now Just wondering if what you‚Äôre implying has security or racism motive as determining factor? Might as well keep your facebook account, then. Haha Google Hangouts messages can theoretically be read by Google. 

(and they have: [https://gawker.com/5637234/gcreep-google-engineer-stalked-teens-spied-on-chats](https://gawker.com/5637234/gcreep-google-engineer-stalked-teens-spied-on-chats)) I have been able to send Signal messages with my laptop with my phone turned off, although your phone is still considered your main device. I really doubt that would happen to be honest.

The Signal foundation non-profit was formed after WhatsApp was sold to Facebook. Brian Acton (the original founder of WhatsApp) stepped away from it and donated $50 million to kickstart Signal. I think due to Signal being a non-profit, being bought it isn't possible. [deleted] Exactly! üôÑ Targeted ads for shit you want = evil.

Grow up. Obviously just the security sense. After a bit of digging others have said the same as you as well.  Sounds like I was wrong about signal (in my defence I was not 100% certain). And Telegram just looks nicer and, arguably, more intuitive than WhatsApp. Telegram isn‚Äôt end to end encrypted Cambridge Analytica. 

Radicalised population through Facebook's algorithms. (Just look at what happened in the US recently).

Rise in belief of conspiracy theories about vaccines during a pandemic (suggested to users by Facebook's own algorithm).

Intentionally built platform so you are addicted, even though  employees keep raising the concern that Facebook is doing it intentionally. Refering to their customers as 'users'. 

Many of us are not okay being the product.  But even if you are okay with that, Facebook doesn't deserve the monopoly it is trying to build. It has failed consistently. It might not be intentionally evil but they have shown complete contempt for humanity consistently. When lawmakers won't act, we can through not supporting them. Just asking, as Russian dev. fair enough [deleted] This man's eye is open. I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt trust an app w/o end-2-end encryption, this could be the key to the data breach. BTW it‚Äôs a fact that this app is developed by VK team and has dev support team from Dubai, no secret here and it‚Äôs noted on Wiki.
So, do you think Wiki has informed his lectors driven by racism or by security sense of the app? It can be leaked because if they can decrypt it on the server they have to store the encryption key.
Police can also take advantage of the missing encryption. He's TOTALLY WOKE MAN Looks like you‚Äôre one of few people who find VK devs and living in Dubai being a threat. :-) Go watch the Social Dilemma on Netflix. I'll be surprised if you don't feel the same. A threat no, an issue regarding the data security to install this on my devices, yes. :-)"

If he has lockscreen notifications visible, he could ask a or multiple contact(s) via WhatsApp Web to send him a WhatsApp message such as ""Lost, please return [012-345-6789]"".

Since you declined the use of your data specifically, but don't know the legal construction behind it.

There‚Äôs really no way you can safeguard against that, when you share your number with your friend/family member, they can sell your number to a call centre directly too.

That being said, Facebook‚Äôs business model has never sold any user data to any third party. What they do is allow businesses to run targeted ads on their platform, which is a different thing compared to handing over your data for a price.

It might be true that they have most of that data anyway, but taking even small changes so nonchalantly allows big tech giants like Facebook to slowly creep themselves into our private lives for profit  Why not come to this conclusion 7 years ago when Facebook took over Whatsapp and a social debate was going on about jumping to telegram? A python analogy can be made in terms of changes creeping up, but the fact that we feel the need for a messaging application even if it's not whatsapp is already a sign of the tech world having power over people. In the end it doesn't matter what you, or I, or OP does. If whole populations shifted away from whatsapp only then would facebook drop a deuce.

And even when you delete all three, Facebook can still create what's called a ""shadow profile"" of you, where they take the information from contacts that your friends upload, in combination with other online tracking methods to create a profile of you. This is one of the reasons why people are upset with WhatsApp, because they are enabling Facebook to ingest even more data when people give WhatsApp in combinations with Instagram, Facebook and Messenger access to their contacts.

In short, I think you have to delete all apps by Facebook to become actively separated by Facebook's data mania :( Delete all of it dude Or just delete whatsapp and facebook and keep IG just to keep up with friends.  I have location disabled and I never allowed the app to read my contacts.  What do you think? Again, I don't really know the inner workings of any of Facebook's companies, but knowing how Facebook makes its money I would assume Instagram tracks your location with Insta and got their hands on your contacts through either WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram unless you're 100% sure you never allowed that.

Privacy policy;16;ktufkj;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ktufkj/privacy_policy/;44;"Why is there such an uproar over the recent Whatsapp privacy policy changes set to go into effect on Feb 8 2021? From what I [understand ](https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/) nothing much has changed. They are simply reiterating what they have been able to do all along, the only change is that starting Feb 8 if you don't agree you can't use the service. 

Their marquee feature remains intact since it's end to end encrypted. There's no proof it has backdoors despite the badness of Facebook. Yes, WhatsApp leaks metadata; they know all your contacts and when you're talking to them. They basically know everything (I mean the metadata) except the content itself. This is no different than your voice call metadata being available to law enforcement using a legal subpoena, standard practice for decades. 

They provide encryption in transit only not at rest. So as long as you don't back it up on the cloud, no Google Drive, iCloud or any other provider, your message content is not available to any service provider. 

Just using well reputed cross platform ad blockers like [uBlock Origin ](https://ublockorigin.com/) and  services like [NextDNS ](https://nextdns.io/) with popular block lists like [OISD](https://oisd.nl) that block tracking should be sufficient to protect privacy, right?

What am I missing?";2021-01-09 19:54:23;"What if you don't have a facebook account?  It is not an account I use much.  In fact I was getting ready to delete it.  My objection is why does Facebook business community need to track my whatsapp?  Why cant I opt out. I've also been wondering if I'm missing something... It seems like most of the world read the find print for the first time Just checked the section about automatically collected information. 

Sure, they‚Äôre not reading our messages, but there‚Äôs also not much meta data left they‚Äôre not collecting. My issue is that there‚Äôs no real opt-out there. Yeah, Ok. Bye. I dunno why people use WhatsApp. Why do this billion people use it? Deleted WhatsApp account and Facebook and I am Telegram for 2 years already. Great experience and recommend to you:)
Cause Telegram is cross-platform (very useful for me)
So, WhatsApp is OK, but there is a MUCH better alternative I'm with you on this. If anything, the new TOS makes it more clear what is going on, and that transparency is good. However, I think given that not much changed in what WhatsApp is doing and sharing, the reaction has seemed overblown. It really does feel like everyone is saying they weren't aware of the terms before, or we're just ignore the fact that Facebook has owned WhatsApp for years already.

I'm all for more people using the gold standard of private messaging, which is Signal, but I rarely get to message anyone there. Maybe that will change now, but I doubt it. Regardless, It seems there's a lot of hype here without much really behind it. Movements that start on false premises can still be good, but how would I get my parents to switch to signal when all of their family is on WhatsApp? It's hard. There was a post on here yesterday which appeared to claim that they were going to be reading our messages now. Questioned it, glad I'm not the only one.

If that starts happening, that's the only thing that'll make me go through the shitstorm of trying to get all of my family and friends onto Signal etc I honestly still feel like they only get transparent with the new tos and that's it, because nothing I've read new is any different from what they were doing anyways What happens to those who have a whatsapp account but don't have a facebook account? I don't even have a facebook account. RemindMe! 1 Day ""I don't need sleep. I need answers"" You are missing it wont help for only blocking it with dns, use signal Totally there should be an opt out, I don't like fb and I don't want WhatsApp data to be shared with fb, unfortunately I don't have much option as most of my family is on WhatsApp. Their stated reason is so they can ""improve the service"".  Regardless, every business transaction is consensual. A business has the right to specify terms of service. If you, as a customer, don‚Äôt agree, don‚Äôt use the service. 

But that‚Äôs not my point. I am asking something different. Why the uproar *now* when nothing material has changed? See the linked Wired article for context. !emojify >:)

:) I use Telegram too, but you have to know that it‚Äôs not as private as WhatsApp. Unless you‚Äôre communicating using secret chats only (and not in any group chats), your messages and media can be read by Telegram. 

The very reason it is ‚Äúcross-platform‚Äù is because the messages are stored in the cloud. I‚Äôve come to understand that Telegram‚Äôs performance and a lot of its features are only possible because of this. Well said. At the end of the day, all these companies are really vying for our attention, a coveted spot on our home screen. On mobile, the common denominator is our phone number. Due to network effects, switching our entire family and friends from one platform to another is a big barrier to entry and they know this. 

This reminds me of the pre iPhone era when messaging services like AOL Instant Messenger dominated and there was this [ambitious ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillian_(software)) multi platform client software that could connect to multiple back end messaging services. Unfortunately given the  highly competitive environment today this is unlikely to come to pass. I would love for some standardized back end messaging platform where features like e2e are guaranteed, mobile numbers and message history and your friend ""graph"" is portable between networks and client software competes for customers by innovating around other features. One can always dream üòä Impossible, whatsapp brand is basically ""end-to-end encryption"" What I know they do not read the messages but track also data if you forward a news article which is in my opinion pretty close.. Nothing. Facebook, the company, has access to your data, regardless of whether you have an account on the Facebook flagship app. That is my question exactly.   I rather delete my FB account than my WhatsApp account.  I can't find any information about that. Did whatsapp block you? I‚Äôll be using this reminder message from now on! Thanks!

|-|-|-|-| Can you elaborate? As long as the messages themselves remain encrypted (unlike say FB Messenger), I'm OK with their data collection practices listed on their [privacy policy ](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en). DNS level blocking is simply an extra level of privacy protection to block metrics and other usage data from being sent from my devices. yeah, and it's killing the product. whatsapp used to be great, really the best app in anybody's phone. Now it sucks. thanks to facebook. already started using Telegram heavily and now Signal too. Actually I'm backing up every conversation from whatsapp to close that account completely. tired of facebook spookiness Yeah üôå, Ok üÜó. Bye üëãüèº‚ù§. ahahahahahahah WhatsApp is private? What a joke, ahahah, nice. Man, I recommend you to enhance your knowledge into privacy, really.
WhatsApp is the most readable, the most unsafe and the most Facebook controlled one. While telegram is encrypted. Okay, Telegram can read your messages in secret chat. And what, lol? Telegram doesn't work with any government, while WhatsApp is FULLY under governments:) 

So, I know that many people do not understand it. It's normal due the propaganda. But, when someone will face a real problem, they will find out real pros and cons. Good luck, buddy! It would be a pretty stupid business decision for Facebook, but that doesn't stop me not trusting them in the slightest  I mean, if the whatsapp account is going to be deleted for not having a facebook account [deleted] Not yet Np. It's been a day They are collecting lots of meta data of your devices and possible chats, your location, your network, everything. So actually your chats are not private anymore because they can collect the metadata wich you are sending in thats like pictures videos and links, with that they create a bigger profile of you on the Facebook database for personal ads, and tracking. And Facebook will sell your data Whatsapp has a pretty robust feature set compared to its peers. Off the top, its missing message reactions, screenshot protection, cloud backups are not encrypted. But that's probably unrelated to the fact that FB owns it. From a strategic perspective, they have 2 competing messaging products. This is the crux of the US government lawsuit, their acquisition of Whatsapp should not have been allowed because it was anti-competitive. But I digress... Jesus Christ, dude, you were more focused on mocking u/homogenouslineareqns than providing well-argued information, which is why your comment looks like it was written by an angry teen. Are you an angry teen? As long as that qr code is there your messages are protected As I understand it, if you answered No to the Terms of Service prompt, you will not be able to use WA past Feb 8, regardless of whether you also happen to have a FB account. The [privacy policy ](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en) explains it pretty clearly. Hahahah lol, just do not understand stupid decisions. So, I can guess that you have never heard about constructivism. What a pity I can't answer no, just agree or postpone. But I haven't found the answer to that question yet Would be interested in what happens there too - there is not an option for ‚Äúno‚Äù. If I just do not agree do they force me in or push me off WhatsApp? I think it is the latter, if you do not accept you will not be able to use Whatsapp"

When the media is forwarded, the decryption key is shared with the new recipient. 

I believe the clause is saying that when the media is shared heavily, the encrypted media is kept on the servers for longer. Nothing about this breaks E2EE. I don't think you understand what E2E encryption is. OP has a good point. Can you please explain what I got wrong?

Relevant: [WhatsApp Security Whitepaper](https://scontent.whatsapp.net/v/t39.8562-34/122249142_469857720642275_2152527586907531259_n.pdf/WA_Security_WhitePaper.pdf?ccb=2&_nc_sid=2fbf2a&_nc_ohc=hFDNXSaJaccAX_mFC3H&_nc_ht=scontent.whatsapp.net&oh=5cfbda8ed99d3530cc607fbd5f977898&oe=601F0119) (Check out Page 6) E2E means that the encryption key is only known by the two users at the end. What you're talking about is client to server encryption where you share an encryption key with the server (WhatsApp in the middle). If the service is really E2E, WhatsApp should not be able to decrypt the data so even if they store it, it would just be jibberish and they certainly wouldn't be able to match it with other people sharing the same data because it would be stored with encryption keys. Yes, this is nothing new to me. I am not referring to client-server encryption - nothing about the protocol allows them to read the media.

Let me rephrase my original comment. Let‚Äôs say Alice wants to send an image to Bob. Alice encrypts the media and uploads the encrypted data to WhatsApp servers (note: WhatsApp can‚Äôt read this). She then sends the key for the media via E2EE message to Bob (note: WhatsApp can‚Äôt know the key because the message is E2E encrypted). Bob decrypts the message to retrieve the media key, retrieves the encrypted media from WhatsApp servers, then decrypts the media to access the image.

At no point can WhatsApp access the media in plaintext. Yes, that's correct, but your example doesn't show how they would keep frequently shared data on their servers... I‚Äôm presuming that the encrypted media that is uploaded onto WhatsApp servers is kept longer as more pulls are requested.

Do we agree that regardless of how long WhatsApp keeps the encrypted media, E2EE is not broken? Yes, the length of time is not an issue. They could keep it indefinitely.

My point is that if Sally shares a cat meme with Bob, WhatsApp can keep the cat meme data, but it would look like this (abcdefg).

If Sally were to reshare the same cat meme with Bob later it's possible that WhatsApp could use the same data (abcdefg), but even if Bob forwards the cat meme to Dave the data WhatsApp sees would look different because Bob and Dave have different keys (gfedcba). And if Paul downloads the same cat meme from Reddit and shares it with Linda it again would look completely different to WhatsApp because of different encryption keys (ytreeqp).

So it seems to me that the only possible benefit of keeping media for longer would be if the same two people reshare the same cat meme (and maintain the same encryption keys), but that just seems unlikely that would happen with enough volume to make the storage worth it. The meme is not encrypted with the same keys used for E2EE. The meme is encrypted with a new key generated by Sally when she first uploads the image to WhatsApp servers. 

This meme key is then encrypted and sent via E2EE from Sally to Bob. When Bob forwards the meme to Dave, he re-encrypts the meme key via E2EE. The meme image is not actually being sent each time it is forwarded. Only the key to decrypt the meme.

Thus, the same encrypted meme image (uploaded by Sally) is reused in both cases, and all clients are able to decrypt it with the meme key without WhatsApp being able to.

Edit: as for images uploaded by different parties, WhatsApp has no way of knowing if they are the same image, and are treated as different images. Ah, I see what you mean. That makes sense. The image is stored on their servers with its own encryption key, so my second example when Bob forwards the meme to Dave, Bob knows the encryption key for the file and sends it in an e2e encrypted message to Dave. Dave then downloads the same file from WhatsApp.

I'm curious if Signal or Telegram do exactly the same thing with attachments. It seems to me that it's way less private as technically WhatsApp doesn't know what the file is, but WhatsApp knows everyone who that same image is forwarded to and in theory could be forwarded that image to itself. If it's forwarded enough it's no longer private and the issue is that WhatsApp now knows what Sally shared with Bob.

I agree this is what WhatsApp is doing, but I do think it goes against the principles of e2e encryption and complete privacy.

Thanks for sticking with me on this one! No problem, I‚Äôm glad I could clear that up. Signal handles it the same way as WhatsApp, in fact WhatsApp is actually using the Signal protocol. Telegram isn‚Äôt end-to-end encrypted in default mode so forwarded media is most definitely ‚Äúreused‚Äù by keeping a server-decryptable copy in the cloud.

I‚Äôm not quite sure what you mean by WhatsApp forwarding the key to the image to themselves. That‚Äôs akin to saying WhatsApp can make a client send any message from an E2EE chat to them. 

The security of media and their keys doesn‚Äôt differ from a regular E2EE message. If I forward a plaintext message many times, it doesn‚Äôt become less secure, because each time I forward it, it is reencrypted E2E with the new recipient."
WhatsApp web connection issues on new Android phone;2;ktscan;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ktscan/whatsapp_web_connection_issues_on_new_android/;0;"WhatsApp web has worked fine for me anytime before, though since a few days now I am using a new phone, and ever since, I have a hard time getting connected as well as staying connected to WhatsApp web. It seems to solve itself whenever I open my phone (take it out of its default standby mode) even without further interacting with WhatsApp. This is extremely inconvenient. I would like for Web to remain active without having to continuously touch my phone, as it did just fine on my previous phone.

I did some searches before and tried the following things, which have failed to solve the issue:  
\-Turned off ""battery optimisation"" for WhatsApp  
\-""Background data usage"" is on.  
\-""Allow app while Data saver is on"", is turned on.  
\-""Allow background activity"" is on (and cannot even be disabled)  
\-Checked for latest version, turned phone off and on, turned airplane mode on and off.  
\-My Wi-Fi is stable  
\-There are no presumed issues with the pc, given that the connection worked fine by itself with my old phone.

In light of Whatsapp new policy, what should I do? I am very confused. I have 2 questions:

1. Switching to Signal is incredibly easy....what is tough is convincing my friends/family to use it...
2. When  the new policy takes place, what will truly happen, really? Don't tech  giants already know my info? Like google....gmail....facebook...etc?";2021-01-09 14:04:24;"It will be from feb 8. A page will pop up upon opening and it will only allow either U leave or accept and use.
What facebook wants to know is to analyse ur interests to give ads interested by you (idk how will they do). U should convince your friends and family to move to signal. I have been helping my family and friends to switch to Signal since I got the notice, but it got a lot easier to convince people the minutes after Elon Musk tweet. Give Telegram a try. It‚Äôs really similar as WhatsCrap with much more features. Telegram is great. You can use a desktop client to chat without the message having to go through your phone first. So you can send a message from your computer even when your phone is dead / no reception. I used both Telegram and Signal. Yes both are better than WhatsApp, but actually I argue Signal is better. Telegram actually doesn‚Äôt have e2e encryption on group chats, only secret chats, which kinda breaks the point of securely communicating with a group. Signal has e2e for all modes which is already a step in the right direction, plus they don‚Äôt store in servers when Telegram does. The way I see it, use Signal for better security but very similar to WhatsApp, or Telegram which has similar security to WhatsApp but more features."

Check [this article](https://medium.com/adamant-im/telegrams-anonymity-hole-how-to-get-any-user-s-phone-number-88062b4fb94b) yeah my main concern is why I CANNOT archive this specific chat on WHATSAPP? when I can still do it with all other chats. I never heard of this kind of issue, I can only suggest you to give WhatsApp's developers some feedback by going to Settings -> Help -> Contact us. I've had the same thing happen to me yesterday - two messages from phone numbers I don't know, both about ""investments"". I reported and blocked both, now I cannot delete or archive either of them. I've tried on the desktop and mobile apps, WhatsApp says ""Couldn't delete chat""."
Simple guide to next steps: export your conversations and delete your account;59;ktnr0r;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ktnr0r/simple_guide_to_next_steps_export_your/;28;"Your data aren't stolen until 2/8, whether you've agreed to the new terms or not. After 2/8, your data will be stolen whether you've agreed to the new terms or not... unless you delete your account. If you don't agree and merely uninstall, WA will simply steal your data from your contacts' contact lists (as if they're authorized to consent to anything involving your personal information). If you delete your account, you are removed from your contacts' contact lists. This prevents the data theft. **Just uninstalling isn't enough. You have to delete the account.**

But first, export your data! This is different from backups. Backups are basically owned by WA so you can't touch them outside of WA, and the text of your conversations is encrypted in a backup so you couldn't read it anyway. Exports produce a simple text file for each conversation's messages, and every media file sent over the course of the conversation if you so choose. Fortunately, the export process is reasonably easy: you export one conversation at a time, with a few taps.

1. Open a conversation you'd like to export.
2. Tap the three dots for actions.
3. Choose the option for even more actions.
4. Choose ""export.""
5. If there are any, you'll be prompted on whether to include media. Otherwise it's just the text messages.
6. Choose an app for export. For example, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.
7. The app you're exporting to will prompt you to choose a location in whatever method it uses. You might want to create a separate folder for each conversation to keep media separated by conversation.
8. After the export finishes, you'll have a plain text file with that conversation's text messages, as well as all the media files if you chose to include them.
9. Repeat this for each conversation you'd like to save.

After you've saved everything, delete your account. Remember to leave some scathing criticism in the box asking you how WA can improve.";2021-01-09 12:18:49;"https://twitter.com/mikebutcher/status/1347105722035822593?s=09 I think that the big question is, how many people will actually leave WhatsApp because of that new TOS?

From my point of view, most of the people (most of the users), doesn't really know what really happens behind the scenes when it comes to privacy. When I try this, not all my messages are exported. I think it only exports what that device received, not all the manages in that chat (from previous restore).
Any solution that exports all messages? I accidentally agreed..So it should nor be a problem if i delete my WhatsApp account..right? I've done this and it only makes a partial backup of my conversations. For example, in one with my sister the backup only goes back to 2018 whil the chat on my phone goes back to 2016. Likewise a number of photos in the chat are absent in the backup. Is there a better way to do this? Good guide but if you really believe that Facebook is going to steel you whatsapp data you're wrong Signal and Telegram are seeing large spikes in new users. Signal in particular is having load issues from the sheer numbers, probably due to Elon Musk Tweeting that it's a good alternative to choose when quitting WhatsApp. I'd guess that WA knew this would happen going in, and determined that the loss of all these users was worth the extra money they would make from harvesting the data of the remaining users. That's weird. The only thing I can think of is that maybe those restorations don't fully load the conversation. Perhaps you can force them to show up by scrolling all the way up to the first message in the conversation? Try exporting again after that and let us know if that does the trick. Same for me. Only exports what is cached, which makes this 99.9% useless. Yes; if you delete your account, there will be no data left for them to take on the 8th. Another poster had the same issue. If scrolling up to the beginning of your conversation before exporting solves the problem, let us know. Not wrong. The new changes will allow WhatsApp to share your contacts, purchases, addresses, credit card info with Facebook. I don't have my phone number or address on Facebook but I've shared this on WhatsApp so Facebook gets it anyways with this new data mining I gave it a go. It did not. Hold on, I haven't seen them saying they'll store the contacts, and I don't know what purchases and addresses someone will be doing/sharing on whatsapp How would they get your credit card number This is not going to happen.

I am as pissed with FB's business practices as anybody and avoid any and all FB products i possibly can. But this is simply not going to happen.

Reason: this is illegal in the European Union.

When FB acquired WhatsApp, they merged WA data with FB data. There were lawsuits to stop it. FB wss massively fined and prohibited from doing this.

Right now, a series of other lawsuits are ongoing, from several Union Countries vs Facebook.

FB are not allowed to share data between WA and FB in the Union.

For them to do this outside the Union, they will practically have to develop a new set of services and segregate based on your location. That is kind of pointless, seeing as EU laws on privacy are looked to for developing legislation in other countries, too.

A recent example of this is the GDPR directive that forced all websites in the EU to make these ""this website is using cookies"" notifications.

A nifty little feature of that directive, is that i protects EU citizens, independent of their location.

That means an EU citizen residing in the US is still protected. The corporation breaking the directive towards that person will *still* be liable.

And that is why the cookie notification now is a feature on US websites, too: it is simply too messy to provide services dependent on *your current location*, so US-based services simply adopted that part of the GDPR directive in general instead.

And btw, GDPR is deliberately shaped the way it is to plug the loopholes. That goes for WA, too.

Source: just google EU vs Facebook +lawsuits That's disappointing. I don't know where to go from there. :( From your purchases. Also from your messages. An example, someone wants me to treat myself for my birthday so they send me their credit card info so I can shop online. Once done,  I get the retailer to send me a message with the details which I shared back with person via WhatsApp. There are apps out there that claim to do it but they all look sketchy as hell. 

I tried the guide [here](https://geeknizer.com/read-extract-whatsapp-messages-android-iphone-blackberry/) and it failed as well. The files I backed up were way smaller than they should have been. >Also from your messages.

Messages are E2E encrypted, no one (except for you and your chat members) can read what's sent I recommend you don't share credit card info over WhatsApp message (or any messaging system, for that matter), specially if you don't really believe that your messages are encrypted (as seems this is the case).

If you ever forget to lock your phone or if someone breaches on your account (which still could happen even without the new TOS), they could access it and miss use it. Seee that‚Äôs joke of the year You might want to read the privacy card that WhatsApp had to share with Apple. They literally say they‚Äôre going to harvest and store your financial info. [deleted] Any link? Where is this stated in their ToS? Misinformation. WhatsApp messages are still end-to-end encrypted and cannot be read by Facebook. Do you have an iPhone? If yes, go to the App Store, search for WhatsApp, and read the Privacy Card there. 

If you don‚Äôt have an iPhone, Google WhatsApp  App Store Privacy Card. I found this

https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/unpacking-whatsapps-privacy-label-in-the-apple-app-store/?lang=en

It explains that financial information is used in countries where you can send payments via WhatsApp, your card or bank information are needed to complete a transaction.

Also:

""We must collect some information to provide a reliable global communications service. As a matter of principle, we minimize the categories of data that we collect. For the limited kinds of data we do collect, we take measures to restrict access to that information. For example, while you may grant us access to your contacts to help deliver the messages you send, we do not share contact lists with anyone, including Facebook for its own use. We provide further explanations throughout our Help Center, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Service.""

First off, thanks to this subreddit for telling me about the new privacy policy. Honestly, if all my friends would switch over to another app I would too in a heartbeat. Unfortunately that's not the case right now.

So, I just got a new phone and a new number. I changed my number on my old phone but I didn't back up my chats after the change. When I tried to restore the chats on my new phone it didn't restore anything other than the groups I was in. Now my old number account is deactivated. 

I have all the local backups from my old phone so is there any way I can restore my old backup from my old number to my new phone with my new number? Or have I passed the point of no return. :(";2021-01-09 11:43:55;"Are you me? I had the same problem, as I changed jobs and had to return the company phone and sim card.

I had chats going back to 2015.

Just DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT I did too. Gotta move to telegram or signal, but people are still using WhatsApp üòÖ Your data are only being stolen starting 2/8. If you want to prevent that, you have to delete your account. Remember to save anything you want to hang onto first. If you just uninstall the app, you'll still be on people's contact lists, and your data can be stolen from there. Continuing to use the app after Feb 8 requires agreeing to the new terms. 

The only way to avoid the new terms is to delete your account before Feb 8. Same here. What I wonder is if they'll still be able to use the data they retain about me according to the new terms even if I delete my account since I accepted the new terms before deleting my account. Delete your account, I did. Screw Facebook Delete your account. Deleting the app won't delete your account. Sure they are cuz this just now happened. Move to signal and tell your friends that you won't be on whatsapp anymore and neither should they. I got 5 friends join signal already and that's a lot for me. even if we already agreed? This. Anyone? Same thoughts Bump. Interested to know the answer to this too.... This is the way. No one would care about WhatsApp on it's first steps, and look now. According to what the popup says, yes, even if you already agreed. The changes in Terms take effect for all users at the same on February 8. Agreeing just means you can keep using the app after that date and they'll harvest your data from you directly. what should we use instead of whatsapp, is telegram a good choice?
I can't find new post about telegram, all of them posted like 2 years ago and they were saying telegram is bad as whatsapp. Did they change their privacy policy? There are so many web-based chat/messaging apps with all manner of different features and focuses, going back decades: Signal, Skype, Discord, ICQ, Slack, Mumble, Google Hangouts... there are lists and comparisons all over the web. [This article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_VoIP_software) seems decently helpful. And don't forget phone calls, emails, and text messages. **[Comparison of VoIP software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison of VoIP software)**

This is a comparison of voice over IP (VoIP) software used to conduct telephone-like voice conversations across Internet Protocol (IP) based networks. For residential markets, voice over IP phone service is often cheaper than traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN) service and can remove geographic restrictions to telephone numbers, e.g., have a PSTN phone number in a New York area code ring in Tokyo. For businesses, VoIP obviates separate voice and data pipelines, channelling both types of traffic through the IP network while giving the telephony user a range of advanced abilities. Softphones are client devices for making and receiving voice and video calls over the IP network with the standard functions of most original telephones and usually allow integration with VoIP phones and USB phones instead of using a computer's microphone and speakers (or headset).

My last message;23;ktkhhn;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ktkhhn/my_last_message/;0;"I'm deleting WhatsApp and switching to signal. 

WhatsApp has been part of Facebook for a while. A coming change means that harvesting people for data will become far more extensive and invasive.

When you sleep and wake. When you're busy or most distractable. What links you click. Knowing everyone you communicate with and for how long. When you're most likely to share...

These details are not needed to run a messaging app. They're not.

'I have nothing to hide.'

This is not about hiding or secrecy. If you have nothing to hide why do you wear clothes? The availability and expectation of privacy is natural for humans and is a human right. It is in the human rights declaration. 
You may not feel as if someone has pulled down your pants in public when using Facebook or WhatsApp, but that could well be because you are not aware of all the ways you are being exposed, violated and exploited.

'But everyone uses it'

Yes. Over two billion humans now use WhatsApp. It is a precious addition to the Facebook monopoly. It has become an apparatus to surveil human behaviour in a way that would be the envy of the Stasi. People whom maintain that they have nothing to hide should know that examples of data mentioned above are just a raw resource to harvesters of humans' data.

It can be processed and extrapolated upon. It can and is being fed into advanced artificial intelligences to build a portrait of you, social groups or society as a whole. It can contribute to motivating and controlling a populace or individual. Even if you don't care about the specific metrics being collected from you, they can and will be used against you. 

The apparatus poses the potential to be co-opted for explicit mass surveillance (like the Stasi did), or to undermine and subvert a free and democratic society (like Cambridge Analytica did).

Regardless of this vulnerability, entities like Facebook and Twitter are abysmal stewards of this power to shape society. You need only look at the recent misuse of social media by public officials to see how these companies value profit over human lives.

'It's not so bad'

When everyone heated their homes using coal, it would be easy to imagine someone saying they do not care about the pollution that their specific home causes. It is, after all, just a small amount. It is especially convenient since all of your friends use it, and is even integrated into your life already, with a fireplace and delivered direct to your door. The expense of a different fuel and the inconvenience is enough to keep you using it. Pollution from coal still kills untold masses of people every day, including the people that use it to keep themselves warm. The absurdly wealthy owners of the means of coal production do not care about the harm it causes, so long as the money keeps 
coming. 

Facebook/Whatsapp is entirely the same.

The entity collecting information has one drive and that is 'make money now'. It emphatically does not care about your well-being.

'I can't do anything about it'

Wrong. While deleting Facebook may be a step with which many people struggle, Whatsapp is not the same.
The bar for resistance has never been so low. Signal offers the same functionality and does not harvest any data. Telegram is a little better. We needn't even convince the most apathetic 50% of society. So long as there are more caring and knowledgable people in society using an ethical platform, the remaining minority will use a more ethical platform out of shear convenience.

BTW I dropped WhatsApp in 2014 because I saw this day coming. and lets remember, they said they wouldn't put those new terms in when they purchasing Whatsapp originally.

BTW, **Signal** Difficult decision, I guess Signal if you are tin foil hat level and don't care to keep the same one-phone-linked account limitation with no cloud syncing to multiple devices (easily the worse WhatsApp limitation for me). Otherwise Telegram, as it offers true multi-device syncing and much more than Signal but without full E2EE across all chats.

In any case, good luck moving your contacts to any of the two... WhatsApp 300 contacts (or so)

Telegram 50 contacts 

Signal 7

Moving from WhatsApp to either platform (Signal/Telegram) is an arduous task for me. I can't get my contacts moving, and I've given up long time ago. I'll just ride the wave for now. At least the EU is safe but i still made a signal and telegram account. For me I think it's pretty simple for most people if they ask the right questions.

If you want an enhanced WhatsApp clone but don't care about its Russian roots, lack of security and privacy, use **Telegram**.

If you want your conversations to only stay between you and the recipient, your ONLY choice is **Signal**.

Most people should be able to clearly identify themselves in one or the other. Signal. Telegram plans to monetize this year so you might have to switch again depending on what they do. Signal is funded by donations. I have exactly the same question, even though I know the advantages and disadvantages. ^((I think, anyone please correct me if I'm wrong).)

**I think that some people could be overwhelmed by Telegram, but others might see missing features in Signal, which makes this a hard choice.**

***tldr: Telegram is focused on having a lot of features, particularly for group chats, but not that much on privacy. Signal is more focused on the privacy of your conversations, but it's not as feature-rich.***

If you don't know what end-to-end encryption means, it means that only you and the person you're chatting with can read your messages, and no other third party, even if they wanted to. With regular encryption, only you, your recipient, and the service can read your messages. WhatsApp claims to have it but they make mandatory backups of your messages, locally or in the cloud, and have the decryption key for them, which means they have the power to read your messages.

Telegram is pretty feature rich, and their messages are stored in the cloud, encrypted, but not end-to-end, scattered through different countries, which means that if all of Telegram wants to read your messages, they can, but it also means that if you lose all your devices and get Telegram again, you will have access to them without having to have made a backup. 

Telegram has some nice features, especially with groups, like: pinning messages, polls, admins have the ability to delete others' messages, bots are non-human accounts that can assist you with several things. Telegram DOES offer end-to-end encryption with their ""Secret chats"" feature, but it doesn't sync them to your non-phone devices, and you have to create a secret chat for every contact you wish to have a private conversation with.

Telegram already has a lot of public and semipublic groups for several topics, and a lot of ""channels"" (one-sided groups where only the owners can post stuff), even some with pirated media.

Signal is more like a drop-in replacement for WhatsApp. With Signal, all your conversations are end-to-end encrypted. You can set up disappearing messages for every chat. It has other privacy-focused features like hiding your IP from who you're calling, and even sending messages anonymously (which I haven't really used but it's nice that they're there).

Some people are saying there are some limitations on the iOS version, but the team is working on them as I speak, so I wouldn't worry about it if I had an iPhone.

Both Signal and Telegram have the expected conversation features: messages, media, voice messages, files, stickers.

Signal is a nonprofit (which means it can't be bought by a company like Facebook), but Telegram isn't. Telegram is going to add ads and paid features, but Signal isn't.

Signal is fully open source (which means the source code = how the app works and was made can be read by everyone). Telegram is open source only for the client (phone app and desktop app), but not for the server, which means you can't know for sure what they do with your messages and information.

None of them have ""statuses"" or ""stories"", and some of my contacts use them a lot. Signal has Messenger-style reactions but Telegram and WhatsApp do not. Like WhatsApp, both require you to verify your phone number and are centralized.

And P.S.: If you're using Android, the default keyboard app could still send the contents of what you type. Google could then use that to show you target ads (and to improve the suggestions). This could be prevented by switching to another keyboard, or using Signal with the ""Incognito keyboard"" feature. As for the iOS keyboard, I'm not sure. Another thing, apps with notification permission can read your messages; go to Settings to see which apps.

I think there's still a lot to compare, but this message is already long as heck I think I‚Äôll download both and try to use Telegram most of the time, is that dumb? Hardly anyone using Telegram or Signal here. Have been using Telegram for about 1.5years. But no one joins
 Even if people join, they download movies and then uninstall the app. LOL I already agreed by mistake what should I do next?? Quietly? They showed the update to your face SIGNAL Signal Telegram I use both Signal and Telegram. I find whatsapp more useful than Facebook. *How the turn tables* Same thing happened with Oculus, they promised one of the founders they wouldn't require a Facebook account for using Oculus, he even posted it publicly.

Then they did just that when releasing the Quest 2, it's only usable with a Facebook account. The problem is getting others to shift to Sognal or Telegram too. Its weird but even our neighborhood whatsapp group is discussing moving. I went to both.  Signal as my preferred first choice if everyone would go with me, and Telegram because more of my contacts are likely to go there.

And no, I haven't had much luck moving friends across. Just close family have followed. >In any case, good luck moving your contacts to any of the two...

LOL I installed telegram years ago, not a single one has moved to telegram, even with better stickers, video, photos and files sharing support.

Probably he won't need to hide data cause there wont be any to hide. Signal does provide multi device support. I have it installed on my Android phone and Linux Mint computer and the Linked device feature lets me use the app on both. In fact unlike WhatsApp I don't need the phone to be connected to the internet if I want to use Signal only on my Linux PC. Or maybe I have completely misunderstood what you meant by syncing, in that case please do elaborate what you meant to say. In case I understood you correctly try out the Signal client for PC ;) Turn the tides, O wise master!
I‚Äôve converted 15 of my contacts to signal! I just dropped a ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be reachable on WhatsApp post 8th Feb‚Äù and the trade-off here is that you win some you lose some for privacy. My contacts are pretty much the same, Telegram is slowly becoming the new mainstream When the donations dry up, what then? Telegram plans to monetize and some ideas are by advertising in huge one to many channels run by businesses, and selling premium stickers. Of course things can change for either platform in the future. I actually ended up doing just that so, to answer... No (?) This is fine. You can still switch, just make sure to delete your account Sure, but which one uses the vast majority of your contacts? I can install a dozen of apps, that doesn't mean I get to really use them to communicate with all my contacts. You could give ‚ÄúSignal‚Äù a try! I agree, I started yesterday, one at a time telling people. If everyone deals with a few people, it will spread. That's Desktop support only, not multi-device support as having that would mean you could install it in two or more phones, on iPad or Android tablets natively and alternate between any of them. And as far as I could see it's a half baked Desktop support because even though it doesn't need to have the phone online (which is good), sadly it won't sync old messages so if you have to relink your desktop you would have empty conversations there and will need to read your old messages on your phone to continue existing conversations on your desktop.

So that's why out of all three, only Telegram have true multi-device support and seamless syncing across all of them. I can't say what will happen in the future, but I hope they'll get continuous funding for a long while. The other thing is that Signal is open source, so the community can contribute to the development, not just financially. To be honest if the put ads on signal and charge $1 per year or something to remove these, a large population would happily pay. Not sure if this would be enough to keep the servers alive but just a thought for now... That is the main question, really. It will work as a great filter, for both parties. i got 500+ people on whatsapp, 90ish on telegram and 7 on signal I‚Äôm in the US so people don‚Äôt use these as much. Both Signal and Telegram are getting more users on my end, which is cool. Thanks for such a cogent explanation. Telegram wins in this regard by a fair margin, but since I don't mind some minor inconveniences as long as privacy is not compromised on, I think I would still recommend Signal over Telegram. Simply because the Telegram chats don't have end to end encryption by default and only their ""Secret Chats"" have that. If this is a misunderstanding on my part please do share your views, as you clearly seem to have used both the services for longer than I have."

I use truverifi anytime something asks for a phone number The trackers Then I don't think you fully understand how VPN works.

Stonks;147;kt3qyh;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/y7jsknkse4a61.jpg;23;;2021-01-08 17:42:21;"Well. Telegram is great too. I literally only use WhatsApp to communicate with my gf in Italy. Should we just switch to Signal with all this creepy shit going on with the data they're taking? so glad i spawned in europe. In certain ways it's better than Whatsapp, but Telegram doesn't even have an option for E2EE group chats. It's the greatest in terms of features, tbh. No other messaging app offers unlimited cloud storage, file sharing at 2GB per file, huge groups, channels that you can actually make money on. Like I've personally been storing some stuff in a private group and it saves me soooo much space on my HDD. NO telegram I mean... probably. Signal kinda sucks in terms of interface and features but it's probably the safest option amongst the big apps right now. If you're not socially obligated like most to use WhatsApp then by all means swap. You way also want to check Telegram. Good features, nice interface, data security. Best option IMO why cant other countries copy paste GDPR laws into their system? Well, darn it, you'll have to plot your terrorist attacks elsewhere. He! WhatsApp do not have E2E at all. If someone in your group as backup (and that‚Äôs default settings) your encryption is broken as data are saved cleared. Also, There is prove for many backdoors. 

Honestly, I would not trust encryption from a company where business is to collect data. 

Not sure, but is the WhatsApp source code open? E2ee? I don't find the interface an issue though, isn't it basically the same? I agree with the first 2 things, but Telegram doesn‚Äôt have e2e encryption for group chats, and for DMs e2e isn‚Äôt even a default option. Signal is better, but I respect your opinion. No it isn't. Whatsapp has many security issues, and Signal is a good alternative in that regard. My comment was mostly saying that Telegram is not a good alternative, since in some regards is even worse than Whatsapp. End 2 end encrypted I guess End to end encrypted. Yes but WhatsApp has shit interface lol It depend what you want. Signal use your phone number. In my country, phone number are linked to identity. So on group chat a prefer using an alias and not my phone number. That way, my data are way more secured. 

And if we trust Telegram (which is not 100% my case) data are e2e encrypted. They say it is stored encrypted on there server and that the key is stored on another server in another country. 

Anyway, compared to Wathsapp both are way better :) That shit interface is the exact interface common people are comfortable with. Yeah true both are far better than WhatsApp, and I suppose that‚Äôs what matters. Yes.. In case of Telegram, the messages and the key are stored in two different servers in two different countries so in order to get access to messages you need to get court orders from two different countries and I can't trust Signal now as Signal operates in America and many times FBI have reached out to WhatsApp and Telegram to create a backdoor for them so that they can get access to messages so I think in future, FBI may reach Signal for creating backdoors for them and with how aggressively NSA and FBI work as security forces, it might become hard for Signal to survive being an american company.. And that is why signal uses it"
New Policy and GDPR;11;kt2zwo;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kt2zwo/new_policy_and_gdpr/;9;"Hey all! I live in Finland, which obviously falls under the EU and its GDPR protection. Does this automatically stop Whatsapp from sharing my data with 3rd party actors, especially Facebook in this case?

I know it would be much more simple to delete my account and switch to something like Signal (already working on it) but convincing my friends and family who couldn't care less about their data is an uphill battle.";2021-01-08 17:02:12;"Would like to know the answer as well. Should be illegal in the eu what whatsapp is doing. I'm also fighting same battle with you on same frontline. People here doesn't care much about their information/data and who handles those. Also mostly they doesn't understand at all what you try to tell them...

About GDPR I think that it doesn't protect much if EU countries like Finland doesn't follow it sometimes. Our local (Czech) news said that‚Äôs covered by GDPR, but I doubt it applies fully, as I already downloaded an update notifiing me about upcoming changes next month. It said it changes:

‚ÄúHow bussinesses can use Facebook hosted services to store and manage their WhatsApp chats‚Äù.

So, even in EU, if I understand correctly, WhatsApp merges ‚Äúsome‚Äù data to provide FB businesses access to WhatsApp chats, but it is unclear which data will be shared.

I am already decided to leave WhatsApp, because this is beyond level thats acceptable for me.

edit: styling If you agree to share your data there's no GDPR violation.
 If you don't agree, well you know... Doesnt stop the Zuck from opening a Facebook  HQ in the EU. Happy cake day! It gets worse, apparently Facebook rammed a decision through the Vienna courts that (if I understand correctly) allows them to disregard GDPR True enough. Already wiped my Facebook account months ago, Whatsapp tomorrow. Now if I just had the heart to get rid of my instagram account. still being appealed, but unfortunate decision for now. [case in question](https://noyb.eu/en/vienna-superior-court-facebook-can-bypass-gdpr-consent-must-give-access-data). btw, support noyb, they're doing a great service to all of us.

It's too tiny to be viable for me and a lot of people but it's a good backup. Just curious, why do people find Telegram a good alternative? It isn‚Äôt even end-to-end encrypted unless you use secret chats, and anecdotally most people I know don‚Äôt seem to do that. I like it because of features, design and being able to actually find my friends on it. Can't speak for everyone else though. These days I like anything that's not WhatsApp, lol. You can send messages from your computer without it going through your phone, so like when your phone is off or poor reception. I see, from a features and UX standpoint I understand. It‚Äôs really great, I‚Äôve been using it for the last 6 years or so. But if you‚Äôre privacy minded, Telegram is a step down from WhatsApp, unless people don‚Äôt mind their messages and media being readable by Telegram or a third party who gets inside Telegram‚Äôs servers. That feature is only possible because Telegram uses server-client encryption, which allows Telegram to read the messages and media you send. I get that Telegram has a lot of such nifty features (which is why I prefer using it over WhatsApp), but people need to understand there‚Äôs a privacy trade-off.

On a personal, this change of policy is making it much much easier for me to leave Whatsapp completely.

What  I would find wonderful is to have a short message or a few images that I  could upload as Whatsapp status images repeatedly until february 8th, so that the  privacy issue reaches many more people. How about  using this subreddit  to create such a series of images?

I  want these images to be as informative and low-level as possible. Let's not  get into discussions such as Signal vs. Three vs. self-hosted Jabber  vs. Matrix vs. ...

&#x200B;

I imagine these images to have very few words (1-2 sentences per image max), with illustrated graphics and maybe one link for further reading.

&#x200B;

I would suggest the following for every image:

1. What and when exactly is Facebook's policy changing?
2. How will this affect the average person?
3. Why might this be a problem?
4. What other options with respect to Whatsapp does the average technically non-savant person have?

2. If one deletes fb, would that stop them from being able to cross reference accounts? I don‚Äôt want fb knowing my phone number or IP (although I‚Äôm using VPN anyways) Or literally any information about me outside the app.

3. What are ‚Äúany payments made through WhatsApp‚Äù? I‚Äôve never heard of any payment feature on WhatsApp

4. ‚Äúwhich could include contacts, status updates, when people use WhatsApp and for how long, and unique identifying numbers for users' phones‚Äù this is by FAR the most f**** up part. What does one make of this? 

An answer to all or any subset of these questions would be great. Please don‚Äôt say ‚Äúuse signal or telegram‚Äù. I know about these and have been trying to convert people over for a while, but anyone who uses WhatsApp as much as I do knows it‚Äôs literally a de facto monopoly in much of the world to communicate with people. So what‚Äôs the best way to minimize the damage going forward?";2021-01-08 06:48:35;">What are ‚Äúany payments made through WhatsApp‚Äù? I‚Äôve never heard of any payment feature on WhatsApp

WhatsApp has launched [payment service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp#WhatsApp_Payments) in India, on Dec 2020, powered with [BHIM UPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHIM). You can learn about it here: [https://www.whatsapp.com/payments/in](https://www.whatsapp.com/payments/in) This is quite alarming.

Once source I read states "" facebook, for example might be planning to share your number with third parties, who will then be able to communicate with you through the app"". Further, contacts you have your number saved, irrespective of whether you have WA will help the company profile you. 

&#x200B;

1. Should still be end - end. 
2. no idea! 
3. Believe this is being trialled and rolled out in few countries for now
4. yeah its fu\*\*ed

&#x200B;

The question I have is, are FB and WA automatically synced on my phone - how are the details shared?"
Do the changes go into effect as soon as you agree, or only in February?;2;ksu9gr;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ksu9gr/do_the_changes_go_into_effect_as_soon_as_you/;2;Since the changes involve not only a user's own data but also the PII of everyone on their contact list (which seems about as reasonable as allowing someone to cut in line _behind_ you), I'm wondering whether there's still time to delete my account and save my data from Faceculusgram or if it all got stolen the instant one of my contacts mindlessly agreed to the popup holding their WhatsApp hostage, in which case asking for consent in the first place was just privacy theater.;2021-01-08 06:39:11;"In Feb 8th Replying to confirm. I looked over the popup once again, and it says ""By tapping AGREE, you accept the new terms and privacy policy, which take effect on February 8, 2021."" Thus, WA is just gathering consent for now, and the actual theft of data will only take place on 2/8 for all users who've already hit ""AGREE.""

Those who've deleted their account before that will be safe from the theft, as doing so removes your contact info (name, phone number, profile photo) from your contacts' contact lists. Those who still have an account but haven't consented to the theft by that point will be blocked from using the app but your data will be stolen anyway by having your contacts consent to it for you via their contact list."
How different is this from Google?;2;kstxcj;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kstxcj/how_different_is_this_from_google/;8;"Hey guys.

&#x200B;

Please enlighten me. I know there are a lot of discussions going on about WhatsApp's new privacy policy. But is this not what Google has been doing since inception? 

&#x200B;

WhatsApp will not be able to read our conversation (So that's protected), it will only be able to access our mobile number, status, groups we have joined, profile photo (basically all the metadata). But if you have an Facebook account, you would have already shared this information with them. And about the phone location, OS, OS version, I think if we have the Facebook app installed, they would already have collected right?

&#x200B;

""Whenever something is free we are the products"". I know this is true. But I may consider switching the day WhatsApp starts showing ad banner.

I for instance deleted my facebook back in 2014, and have purely stayed out of their ""ecosystem"". Whatsapp has been an exception till now. Facebook has relatively stayed out of the functioning of it, and has treated it as a standalone messaging app but this is an end to that. Just recently they unveiled their plans of ""connecting all the platforms under Facebook"" and you can already see that with instagram dms and facebook messenger. **This** is another step toward it, and things are only gonna get worse. Exactly, I don't understand what's the big deal. I feel like this policy is already in action and this is just a formality. Aren't you using Instagram? [deleted] Nope. Ngl Instagram was a good platform, it made me interested in photography and I used it a lot back in 2015-2016. But slowly after that I started losing interest in the platform as it started becoming more ""facebook-y"" and after the recent reels feature I deleted my account. Okay. I'm on Instagram. But not in Facebook.
What's the messenger app you use to connect to people?
Telegram? Signal? iMessage? Me too... I'm on Instagram just because of my interest in photography. That's the only reason I am still on Instagram. But I hate the ads it shows these days.

How to undo agreed new privacy policy on whatsapp?;20;ksopyt;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ksopyt/how_to_undo_agreed_new_privacy_policy_on_whatsapp/;24;"I -without reading- agreed new privacy policy, and I believe many people done the same. After reading its content I decided not to agree. 

Can I change this preference? If so, how?

Jan 9, 2021 - account deleted";2021-01-08 01:38:20;"As it says, the new policy will start to be applied after Feb 8th. So nothing about the treatment they give your data will change until Feb 8th. 

I‚Äôll delete my account that day, be like me, not easy but the best thing to do, they have TOO MUCH power already. Doesn‚Äôt matter, I think it‚Äôs mandatory soon. I did the same thing. I pressed ""I agree"" or ""OK"" whatever the button was saying when it poped up. I react the same way to all pop-ups. Then once I came to know what that pop up was about, I tried to undo it. I think it is not possible to undo it. Whatsapp Instagram Facebook they all same. If whatsapp is allowed to use your personal info what is preventing instagram or facebook from using it? It is time for you to delete all your face, insta and whatsapp accounts. That will be lesson to Zuckerberg. Did they same. Need to know how to undo Delete the account.  

It's not possible to use Whatsapp without agreeing. You have two options :

1. Have an iPhone with ios 14 and turn off targeted ads
2. delete facebook products There's one way to do it. I myself have accepted whatsapp policy and now its really annoying to handle this way. Seems they don't care about people's sentiments and wants to make corporate decisions for slaves who use their business. I have other whatsapp account which i use as second whatsapp didn't accepted policy for that number and its on different user and country phone number. I am thinking to change this user account to that number or by gradually joining groups from that number. At the end i can delete one account which i don't need. It might work till Feb 8. I wonder how business concerns will make decisions to move to Signal or Telegram they got hell of groups where they share info. what if using turning off the targeted ads both using in google chrome with adblock and in phone with opera or similar apps and etc, still is it gonna be concern to share the data ? i am wondering what we could do if we cant really quit due to some mandatory groups that are happening still in whatsapp and which will be continued more such as online education and etc due to pandemic and etc.? but I still have concerns about it...... they lost my trust. they are nothing but burglars to me since I read that pp, and theives are the thieves, deadlines mean nothing to them I suppose. Will delete my account also Still, is there any way to undo it ? Are you sure that after unknowingly accepting their privacy policy they will not access it before 8th Feb? I will delete my acc anyways, but still I don't want them to get my consent. so I was thinking the same thing but also wondering at the same that losing all the data in both numbers since what if gonna happen if moving one whatsapp account number to another one which has already setup in another phone? would they basically be merged in the other phone moved ? if they don't care about privacy in 2021 already, then it's high time you said goodbye to those 1. Remove your DP
2. Remove Profile Name or make it short (like code)
3. Remove Status, or use the one used by General public
4. Don't share any bank detail, that would include yours or others name in it/account number.
5. Don't share personal ""stories"" (images /vids)
6. Don't share any of your personal matters like Favorite clothes/food/place/and many more that can be sold to 3rd party for you to be targeted. 
7. Group messages are most un secure, as anyone can read (i guess WhatsApp too). Limit usage with caution. 
8. They will have access to all your contacts their profiles and all of above mentioned data, so you have to figure out way around it or to hide contacts or something 
9. As it is widely believed or said or whatever, chats between two contact is end to end encrypted, so WhatsApp can't read any of that. Again ain't sure if it is really true. 

If possible just don't use WhatsApp/FB/Instagram, they're one and same at the end of the day. I know our day can't start without WhatsApp, that's the level it is infested in our lives. It's hard, but don't use all of the three. Since years ago, person. But they‚Äôre abusing now. 
And trust me, I‚Äôll delete this shitty app. The only real good thing is that everyone uses it, just that. Other apps have the same features and actually much more. Already moved most of my contacts to a better place. If I delete my account once, can I create another account on the same device? telegram or signal, right?
 btw why u called me person lol Not sure if men, so yeah, person haha. 

Something real is, Signal is the most secure app. The easy answer is, use it. But security is not everything nowadays. What about usability? Privacy?
I got used to use Telegram for everything, even as my NetflixüòÇ. 
You‚Äôll here everyone telling you not to use Telegram because it‚Äôs not End-to-end encrypted. But shit at the end. If you search you‚Äôll find more data leak, filtering scandals about WhatsApp (E2E encrypted) than Telegram (another encryption by default, also E2E in secret chats). 
All the coming features for WhatsApp are in Telegram, (multidevice, keep archived muted chats when new messages, calls to be joined at any moment, etc). Telegram has thousand of more features (I‚Äôd be please to teach you). And Telegram respects more your privacy than any other. Other can use username to find you, they don‚Äôt need your username. In WhatsApp you can set exceptions for who sees your status, in Telegram you can set exception for phone number, photos, last seen, WHO CAN CALL U, who can‚Äôt, etc. 
it‚Äôs so much man. 

For privacy lovers (supposedly). Telegram is from Europe (currently based on Dubai, originally from Russia). They left Russia because they didn‚Äôt cooperate with local government to provide info about users). And Europe is much more strict when it comes to privacy. Search and you‚Äôll see, also search about GDPR (Telegram follows it). Then also search if you want, about Facebook Inc threatening to abandon EU if they don‚Äôt allow them to move EU user‚Äôs data from there to USA.
Wtf with Facebook man! Dubai isn‚Äòt in the EU. Facebook / WhatsApp is GDPR conform too... they literally have a separate ToS and Privacy Policy for GDPR countries... the upcoming changes, for example, completely omit the Fb data sharing in EU. what if Facebook buys signal? They can't. It's impossible to acquire signal because of the way it's setup. We move to telegram?"

Can I backup media from a single conversation?;2;ksio7j;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ksio7j/can_i_backup_media_from_a_single_conversation/;0;"I wanted to format my phone and when the Whatsapp backup was downloaded, only the media came from a single conversation.

For example:

Contact 1 - text conversations 

Contact 2 (my chosen one) - text conversations and audio messages  (media) 

Contact 3 - text conversations

==========

I say in particular audio messages because other media like photos, gifs and videos, it is easy to solve this problem: I just need to go to the gallery and exclude the media from other conversations.

Except that audio messages are difficult because the folder is not separated by contact, all audio messages are together.

In this case I saw two solutions:

1) Listen to audio by audio and exclude the ones I don't want (unviable, I opened the folder and there are more than 3 thousand files).

2) Delete the chat from other contacts and just leave that contact's conversation saved (also not viable, I don't want to miss other contacts' text messages).";2021-01-07 20:59:22;

They want an easily accessible app that they can use anywhere and that has all the features of WhatsApp. Maybe even more, since you're basically asking them to make the switch, need to sweeten the deal. I've had little luck with Signal and similar apps. I live in Europe.  Everyone I know here, and half of my family back in USA, is on WhatsApp.  It would take something far bigger than a privacy policy change to get them to move.  Maybe if WhatsApp started charging $10/month, they'd move. I thought they already shared everything under the Facebook umbrella (Instagram, WhatsApp, ...). Who is going to check what does Facebook do with their internal data?! Deleted today both my wife and I moved to signal. sadly it's too hard to get rid of whatsapp on your phone.

companies are using whatsapp and have whatsapp groups that you NEED to join.

They need your info to use on the upcoming ads.

Show you ps5 or your best pornsites. Signal or Telegram which one is better? After I deleted my account, is there a way preventing my contacts from uploading my number to whatsapp? Damn their meta data to generate targeted ads for things we want to buy. Done bro I've already switched and I'm encouraging all of my family members and friends too Ayo That's called sync, everything that is worded here is needed to recover the account or have it sent to your contacts.


If signal doesn't store your pfp it means that signal doesn't have that feature. Pretty standard stuff Is there anyway to see we accepted or not? When I woke up I saw it. I remember I closed it. If I accepted it is there anyway to undo this? Erasing my account can solve this? Also I wonder if we accept this which will be shared with fb? All of our data until 8th February or data from 8th of february? I am really surprised to see this, so want to know its genuinity, can you provide the source of it? Hey, does anyone have a template or a ""how to"" guide of a communication/message to the WhatsApp company to 
1. Send all of my data to me.
2. Delete my data/account accordingly to the GDPR requirements (European here üëã). What if I use EU vpn ? Cuz EU countries have legislations regarding data sharing and privacy , will I be away from the new terms and conditions? Telegram is definitely a downgrade but it does supports E2EE for secret chats. I somehow can't get into Signal ü§î Use Skype I‚Äôm sending this out to many of my contacts, so I have to know for sure, this is 100% what it‚Äôs says on the terms of service right? It‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt want to spread misinformation or slightly modified information, or information without context, or whatever may be the case, so this is 100% real right? I dont really see these as that bad? Yes thwyre pretty much watching my every move but I dont really care as I dont see why it would affect me in a negative way Better move to Telegram You must have very little friends if you can move that easily Lol your network provider and mobile companies already had that info 
Why don‚Äôt you blame them 
Look dude any digital info is not safe It‚Äòs ridiculous how butthurt you people are about this. If this bothers you, might as well stop using a smartphone altogether. Nothing is free, how do you think the service is being paid for? Love and fairy dust? TELEGRAM MY DEAR.. TELEGRAM. I had similar view and then I jumped the ship and I was surprised by the reduction of drama in my life. Signal! Yep, group chats and having most family and friends on whatsapp makes it a daunting prospect for me too.

That data isn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it would be, glad they're still respecting message privacy. On balance I'll stick with WhatsApp for now, but watching carefully.. telegram is even better than whatsapp in my mind but you're right. whatsapp is THE most used messaging app so it's hard to switch just like that These privacy changes don't affect Europe What about ads? There is a difference now earlier only whatsapp had access to your data now any business running company can use your data for buisness purpose Mark. He's a trustworthy guy it seems. 3 of us Signal in terms of security, Telegram in terms of features. I think your number is already uploaded. Following It's all over the news and has been for the last few days. Just search for it online, you'll find it everywhere. This screenshot is WhatsApp's own ToS btw. Your whatsapp data should be accessible through the app itself. Go to `Settings -> Account -> Request something something` . The report should be available in <= 3 days.

Regarding the second point you should be able to contact customer service and they should provide for you. Probably not. Depends on what country your WhatsApp phone number belongs to. It's great that you don't care they're watching your every move. Some people don't appreciate it tho. Exactly. This is the issue. Like all of my friends (especially international) use WhatsApp. And 98% won‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about this. This. Not to mention workgroups and colleagues who only use WhatsApp and couldn't care less about privacy. Wrong. I've been behind a VPN since 2013 so they have nothing on me. There was a time when whatsapp did cost money. I'd love to go back there. WhatsApp doesn't provide a paid option, but when it did, it was a sustainable business model for them without the need to sell data or ads.  Facebook's 20B acquisition is the reason this is all happening. Telegram is still, from a privacy standpoint, a hefty downgrade from WhatsApp. At least WhatsApp uses the Signal protocol and had their implementation verified via audits.

Telegram uses something proprietary for encryption, not open for audit. Combine that with the fact that the ""Secret Chat"" option is so not intuitive / hidden away and not enabled by default (+ only for 1-on-1 chats), you might as well opt for something exotic, like Discord, as your new platform of choice.

I'd rather take my chances and stay on WhatsApp than revert to a platform without proper E2EE. The only acceptable solutions next to WhatsApp are Signal (they've done a lot to boost their average joe appeal with stickers etc) and iMessage, which locks you into the Apple ecosystem (and has the death of all deaths for a fallback: SMS). E2EE by default or no go. Telegram is a [downgrade](https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/messengers.html). I only use Telegram for my piracy content. Telegram dosn't have e2ee and it's not open source Can you elaborate? Interesting, none of the articles say anything about Europe, one way or the other.  But it's true that I have NOT received this privacy notification on my phone. I doubt in-app ads would drive people away, unless they were overwhelmingly intrusive and frequent or something. Count me in. 4 Oh, I was searching for it in here though

ya, found here Thanks! well, unless you're using iPhone and use iMessage more. Me too Signal is the best alternative You have used WhatsApp always and it‚Äôs not open source, don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs really e2e because no way to know source code. I know you‚Äôre talking about Signal, but it‚Äôs funny how you worry now about being open or not. 
Signal, yes, the most secure app, sadly also from USA and if it gets much popularity, NSA and all of those would make everything for ending with that service.  Telegram not from USA and relocated when local governments want to have any power over it ;)

Furthermore, it‚Äôs really similar to WhatsApp (actually WhatsApp is similar to Telegram and copies everything). So people will get used and love Telegram easily. Neither of the two things you said are true. E2EE is available in one-on-one chats and calls and the apps are all open source with reproducible builds. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55573149 There are no changes to WhatsApp's data-sharing practices in the Europe arising from this update. It remains the case that WhatsApp does not share European Region WhatsApp user data with Facebook for the purpose of Facebook using this data to improve its products or ads I have, and live in the Benelux. The message was in the local language (so not English). https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/key-updates

https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/key-updates-eea?lang=en

spot the differences (eea = european economic area) Like Facebook and Instagram, integrated ads is possible. Actually even if young poeple leave, elderly will stay like Facebook. WhatsApp is also doing what Line,Kakao, wechat is doing by integrating pay option. WhatsApp is not open source but the app behavior of following the signal protocol has been verified by quite a few security researchers, so the point stands.

Signal is probably the most secure messenger app available. It does not yet have the network size of WhatsApp but perhaps some day it will. >You have used WhatsApp always and it‚Äôs not open source, don‚Äôt even know if   
it‚Äôs really e2e because no way to know source code. I know you‚Äôre

ending with that service.  Telegram not from USA and relocated when   
local governments want to have any power over it ;)

The country of origin matters only when the company have the data to provide to the government. The point of E2EE is that no third party in the conversation, including in this case Signal/WhatsApp, will have access to any of your conversation. Yes, WhatsApp and Signal does it but not Telegram. (I'll talk about Telegram's Secret Chat in a bit.) This means no government, no matter where it is based, will have access your conversation as the service provider don't have either, you can't give out information that you don't have. That's the importance of E2EE which Telegram lacks.

WhatsApp also supports E2EE, as a matter of fact it's using the same Open Source Encryption Protocol as Signal does, so what's the big deal? Well, it comes to something called ""Metadata"". Yes, your conversation is encrypted, no one have access to them. But what about the recipient? User Agent? Contacts on your phone? Language of your phone? Apps running? All of those are called metadata and are not encrypted. It will be shared with Facebook and susceptible to any NSA stuffs that you just mentioned. That's why Signal runs superior here.

Why are we so sure about Signal not adding any malicious codes into their app and spy on us? Why do we true Signal's Encryption Protocol but not Telegram's? It's because of something we called ""Open Source"". Being open source means that the community, basically nerds sharing the same passion and thirst for privacy, shall review the code and any ""security back-doors"", ""malicious codes"", ""vulnerabilities"", etc. should be spotted right away. Telegram isn't opensource and the Encryption Protocol used by Telegram isn't either. No one knows if there is a backdoor or any vulnerabilities in the protocol. Soooo.... It's basically not secure and trustworthy.

I am not here to start a battle nor do I not envy the privacy Telegram provides in terms of ""username support"" (Coming soon on Signal, but it doesn't have it now soooo... I'll say Telegram is superior in this area). Telegram is feature rich but it also compromises Security and Privacy of the user. We and our data should not be a product for the company to make money. Data in the wrong hands can also lead to physical danger in your life. To know more, I suggest [https://inteltechniques.com/](https://inteltechniques.com/) and the podcast [The PRIVACY, SECURITY, & OSINT Show](https://inteltechniques.com/podcast.html) What he said It applies for Europe as well Well, the reason I ask is I'm in the EU and I got the updated terms&conditions notice in my iOS app just the same as those who reported this in the US did. I haven't yet read them (and haven't yet accepted either) so cannot tell whether they specifically mention exempting the EU from this update, but there was an update notice pertaining to the new T&Cs nonetheless which is a bit worrying. Aha !  Just received it now, on my Spanish mobile phone here in Spain. Not according to the bbc  
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55573149 Do you have an EU phone number? I am in the states with an EU number and I haven't seen any updates on my phone. Yes I do have an EU number. The notice popped up this morning, shortly after I first read about this issue. So I just went over the EU updated ToS and it seems they aplying this policy change to their EU users as well, which is fucked:

https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/how-we-work-with-the-facebook-companies/?lang=en That page can't be accessed from the States, which is bullshit. I will have to read it when I return in a few weeks.  I see a lot of my European friends joining Telegram this week, much more than normal.  It would be great if there was a mass exodus from whatsapp. Me I'm switching to Signal. I have whatsapp, telegram, and signal. I wish more people would switch to signal. Whatsapp is still the most popular"

I decided to not reinstall it. wtf.;2021-01-07 14:23:11;"Try out Signal. The feature set is almost identical (with the exception of status) What's the news? what about telegram? Is signal is far better than telegram? WhatsApp: Share your data with Facebook or delete your account! WhatsApp users are today receiving an in-app notice informing them about the app's updated terms of service and privacy policy. The notice gives an overview of the main three updates, covering how WhatsApp processes user data, how businesses can use Facebook-hosted services to store and manage their WhatsApp chats, and how WhatsApp will soon partner with Facebook to offer deeper integrations across all of the parent company's products. The changes, which are set to take effect on February 8, 2021, are mandatory and users will not be able to continue using WhatsApp unless they accept the terms. Users that agree to the updated terms will have their WhatsApp account registration and phone number, transaction data, service-related information, interaction information, mobile device information, IP address, and ""other information identified... or obtained upon notice to you or based on your consent,"" shared with Facebook. When explaining how Facebook will use this information, the policy states that shared data is used for ""understanding how our services or theirs are used,"" ""improving their services,"" ""making suggestions for you,"" ""personalizing features and content,"" and ""showing relevant offers and ads across the Facebook Company Products."" Depends on what you want to focus on. In terms of security and privacy, Signal is way better than Telegram. The problem with telegram is that chats are not end-to-end encrypted by default. Only ‚Äúsecret chats‚Äù are. Group chats cannot be end-to-end encrypted. 

In terms of user features, Telegram is definitely way better than Signal. 

It really depends on what you want to prioritise. If it is privacy and security, Signal is what you should choose. E2E isn't default and proprietary. I use Telegram for piracy related communication. But what if you don't have a Facebook account? Will it really matter? I'm sure they'll make a ghost account for you if you ever do join up they'll just match phone numbers etc... >o

Is Telegram that bad in terms of privacy & security? Simple answer, yes. 

Signal is considered the gold standard in the world of cyber security. Edward Snowden swears by it. Elon Musk just now tweeted supporting Signal Disagree. In terms of PRIVACY, Telegram much better, you can hide your phone number and new people won‚Äôt see it when you contact them, they can contact you via username. You can set exceptions for who sees your photos, phone number, last seen, etc. 
In terms of security Signal is the most secure, no doubt. But it‚Äôs not as user friendly as Telegram (and WhatsApp itself), Telegram not e2e everywhere but it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs unsafe. More data leaks and security problem has had WhatsApp with its E2E. Search about Telegram and tell me what u found. 
And Telegram is not from USA as sadly Signal is. That government may do everything to end that service if it gets too popular and we all use it. It‚Äôs United Statesü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è To the people downvoting this person: Please provide actual counter-arguments. These seem like some valid points. Yeah, he's actually correct on all fronts. Signal has E2E all over but privacy-wise and feature-wise it's just weaker. Doesn't make either of the two bad, despite what the fans might say."

Locking down Whatsapp;3;ks82g7;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ks82g7/locking_down_whatsapp/;4;"Hi,

My mom and my sister both use Whatsapp to communicate with me. They are actually the only people I communicate with on Whatapp. This is mostly because for some reason my mom can't figure out how to use other messaging apps.For messaging with others, I use signal.

Is there a way to lock down Whatsapp. I am interested in locking down my contact list for example?

How does not owning a facebook account affect Whatsapp data collection. I don't actually have a facebook account and don't plan to get one.

&#x200B;

Paul";2021-01-07 10:13:42;"First advice is to just install signal on the devices of your relatives and everytime they message you in WA to just answer in Signal.... it works. They get the hang of it pretty quickly and then you can delete Whatsapp.

If you are on android just use Whatsapp through shelter and or a different user profile and just put the phone numbers of them in the respective phone book.

&#x200B;

What your options might be on iOS ...  I dont know. Signal is install on my mom's machine but she can't figure out how to use it. She can't figure out how to use default android  SMS app either. So if she gets a 2FA to her SMS, she can't figure out how to read it. She calls me up to remote to her phone to tell her what the text say.

The only texting app she can use is What's app. Why can she use Whatsapp but not another texting app when they are essentially the same, I have no idea. However, she gets confused when the application icon change. Recently, she called and complain that camera has disappear, but it turns out an update changed the icon from a camera looking thing to a shutter.

Basically I can't get her to change app without much difficulty.

Paul Hey I can only tell you that this was the same case with my parents, but the strategy worked. It is up to you what you want to do, I hope the other advice was helpful though. Thanks, regarding Sheltering, I am playing around with it and it appears to setup a separate profile where you can clone different apps. I was wondering how you would use it to limit whatsapp access. Should I for example just setup an alternate google account with limited contacts list. While whatsapp would still need access to my phone number to install, they won't have access to the other data since it's running from the shelter profile?"

If all the messages are encrypted, what can they share? 

Thanks I‚Äôm advance and sorry if it‚Äôs an obvious question ;)";2021-01-07 05:34:43;"It's at the very least a decline in Whatsapp towards FB Messenger. Except using whatsapp on multiple devices and/or changing from ios to Android or vice-versa is terrible. Very little reason to use this app anymore tbh Signal it is.... Usage data analytics - which features you use, how much time you spend on the app. Also apparently any data required to use the new integrations with e.g. Facebook Rooms. Here to know too Maybe all the metadata? When do you use whatsapp. Which person do you contact the most etc. Maybe any and every bit of data, even though it does not look like is useful, can be useful for them in some way?

Idk. And btw I too have an ELI5 question if anyone knows. How exactly do we know that Whatsapp has End 2 End Encryption? Everything.

It's end to end encryption, not eyeball to eyeball. Even if the encryption is perfect, at a certain point they have to display it to the screen, at that point it has to be plain text so they can call DrawText(plainText) or button.SetText(plaintText). At this point whatsapp/Facebook just has to send this to a whatsapp/Facebook server or stash it somewhere and send a bunch of text later, such as when you are asleep. Whatsapp probably talks to whatsapp.com or facebook.com already and probably via https which you can't decrypt, so you would have no idea when they send the plain text messages as well or if they have already been doing this for years. Sending contacts/meta data as well is a given.

I use whatsapp. It sucks that Facebook bought them. I am trying to get my friends onto signal or telegram. Those apps and any app has the same problem, the plaintext has to be plaintext at some point. But at least those aren't owned by Facebook yet. > Its new updated privacy policy will now require users to share phone numbers, contact information, profile names, profile pictures, user status, and diagnostic data. 

https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/ Let say we Uninstall WhatsApp, FB could still get our contact from our contacts that still use WhatsApp. Our phone number and I guess they say they encrypt but actually they don‚Äôt encrypt That's what even I thought. Then thy have to renege on the end to end encryption promise, which would call into question the whole security aspect. This article details the collection somehwat:
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/whatsapp-share-your-data-with-facebook-or-delete-your-account/ Your phone number, payment transaction data(some countries has whatsapp pay feature), your location, your IP address.

[https://youtu.be/PpcNd0Zsats?t=163](https://youtu.be/PpcNd0Zsats?t=163)

The worst part is you will be agreed automatically to that terms by Feb and if you don't agree to it then whatsapp will not allow you to use it anymore. The massages are not encrypted per say. That's just marketing speech. r/signal is the way to go Signal / Telegram or whatever , once they have enough users they would sell our data as well. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, nothing is free in this world. >	Very little reason to use this app anymore tbh

Except that is literally the most IM app used in a lot of countries. I know it‚Äôs not the best one, but it is what it is. 

Several countries even have zero-rating for WhatsApp so it is also cheaper for lots of people to use it. [removed] Also the phone numbers of all the people in your phone's address book...which you confirm you are authorized to share..somehow... I've also wondered whether they say they encrypt but they don't... scary Now im wondering which would be worse? The modded version which who knows how they have been modified but removed these options or the legit one. Signal is completely open source and doesn't even collect metadata. So no, they couldn't. At least right now there is no way that they can. Telegram has about 400mln active monthly users. 

Idk about you, but in my book that's a pretty damn big number anyway.   
And tbf Telegram announced that they will start to run ads next year. I just have my family group in whatsapp. My brother already left, I'm leaving today. If they want to communicate with us we've given them alternatives. It's dodgy that Facebook gave no warning in the app until the day of the cut off today. Neither. I guess even the modded version would have to bend the knee when contacting whatsapp servers On paper it could just fake data. Now if it is easy or not or if whatsapp have others way to know if they are forged, that's another story."

So my lg was broken 3-4 months ago, which led me to buy a samsung m51. Before buying that, a relative of mine gave me a ""coolpad"" phone. Which is shit.

So i used whatsapp on that phone for like a month, then my new phone arrived. Now i wanna transfer my backup to my new phone, but here's the deal:

1. This coolpad thing doesn't properly backup my data on whatsapp. It was stuck on %99. My drive isnt full, my internet connection is ok, it was just stuck. So backing up the data to my drive, then getting it from there on new phone is unavailable (unless you ppl have something to fix this)
2. I thought of getting the data manually from coolpad and copy pasting it to my phone via my pc, this is no good also. I usb connected the coolpad and it shows ""empty"". Ikr, wtf? Probably gonna have to use a driver or something. Even if i get the data to my pc, idk how to properly transfer it to my new phone.

So i'd appreciate it a LOT if you guys helped me. Thanks already.";2021-01-07 04:54:23;

Mandatory WhatsApp Privacy Policy Update Allows User Data to be Shared With Facebook;50;krtd9e;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/krtd9e/mandatory_whatsapp_privacy_policy_update_allows/;66;"WhatsApp users are today receiving an in-app notice informing them about the app's updated terms of service and privacy policy. The notice gives an overview of the main three updates, covering how WhatsApp processes user data, how businesses can use Facebook-hosted services to store and manage their WhatsApp chats, and how WhatsApp will soon partner with Facebook to offer deeper integrations across all of the parent company's products.

The changes, which are set to take effect on February 8, 2021, are mandatory and users will not be able to continue using WhatsApp unless they accept the terms.

The new terms and privacy policy appear to build upon changes [announced in July 2020](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy), yet this previous update offered users the option to withhold their WhatsApp account information from being shared with Facebook. The latest update eliminates this option.

Users that agree to the updated terms will have their WhatsApp account registration and phone number, transaction data, service-related information, interaction information, mobile device information, IP address, and ""other information identified... or obtained upon notice to you or based on your consent,"" shared with Facebook.

When explaining how Facebook will use this information, the policy states that shared data is used for ""understanding how our services or theirs are used,"" ""improving their services,"" ""making suggestions for you,"" ""personalizing features and content,"" and ""showing relevant offers and ads across the Facebook Company Products.""

The updated terms help WhatsApp to integrate more closely into Facebook's family of products, as it aims to provide a more [coherent experience](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/30/facebook-unifies-messenger-and-instagram/) to users across services. While the changes help Facebook to achieve its larger goals, the high-level of data sharing that WhatsApp users will now be subject to may raise privacy concerns.

Last month, WhatsApp [publicly protested](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/09/whatsapp-protests-app-store-privacy-requirements/) Apple's requirement that developers submit information about what user data they collect for [privacy labels](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/14/app-store-privacy-labels-ios-14-3/) on the [App Store](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/), saying that it could give its messaging app a competitive disadvantage.

Facebook is completely exploiting the dependency that people have on whatsapp, now that so many people use this app. And FB is totally aware of it. At least where I live, you are kind of expected to have whatsapp, and otherwise people won't know how to message you. Of course there is SMS, but that is just not as convenient. I accepted the thing quickly because I got a message from am old friend that would not normally contract me. Ironically it was him saying that he left WhatsApp for this reason.

The terms and conditions will only start applying from February if I understand well. If you delete your account before you should be fine. I am not really savvy in the topic so I cannot say myself, but here is a comment I found on another thread that (hopefully) answers your question:  


[https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/krkvgw/whatsapp\_will\_delete\_your\_account\_if\_you\_dont/gib6vag?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/krkvgw/whatsapp_will_delete_your_account_if_you_dont/gib6vag?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Seems like the EU will recive a different terms:

[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55573149](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55573149) According to [this German article](https://www.pcwelt.de/news/WhatsApp-verwirrt-Nutzer-mit-neuen-Nutzungsbedingungen-10954208.html) the none of the changes will apply to EU citizens, due to GDPR.

Their source is Tweets by Niamh Sweeney, Director of Policy at WhatsApp: [https://twitter.com/NiamhSweeneyNYC/status/1347183889995935744](https://twitter.com/NiamhSweeneyNYC/status/1347183889995935744) What's your substitute? Can we do that with only the saved messages? I have my WhatsApp data backed up to GDrive, how'd you back them up to your pc? I'm guessing: restore from WhatsApp to your phone and move from phone-> hard drive? Hey, where do you see that I got it here in Czech Republic but with only the two bullet points.

[Screenshot ](https://i.imgur.com/q9JSjg4.jpg) Seems that the pop up will be different between EU and others:

well they do have Messenger I know... We'll, we can only lead by example Telegram is getting ads....

Signal is the best alternative Hows Signal? They dont delete it, you cant use the app only, after the date unless you accept the policy change You don‚Äôt need to accept anything, even if you click x, after the stated date it will be accepted automatically. It said so in the pop up I got. In Netherlands also, True. I hope that slowly but surely more and more people realize the impact of what exactly Facebook is doing. I believe that most, if not all, people who do not care about this change, are completely ignorant about what it means or what the consequences are. 

I have seen big names going against FB because of privacy issue and this lead to many (not a lot when comparing to all users, but still quite a group) decided to delete their account. I hope something alike will happen with Whatsapp Security wize is better... But lacks a ton of features.
Telegram will get pay features for power users and business, but not ads.... Telegram has more features and better UI/UX. It can run on multiple devices without being tethered to your phone. If you need end-to-end encryption, use Telegram's ""Secret Chats."" Blocking access to the app is also illegal here. You aren‚Äôt allowed lock a service behind privacy related options like this unless they can prove the service requires them. If they actually block access or delete accounts in the EU, they won‚Äôt get away with it luckily. Me too No. It doesn't lag behing Telegram a lot.
Privacy wise it's miles ahead + open source (Telegram is not) + no ads, ever + secure I've been on signal but been thinking about telegram, what do you think about the directors recent statement about monetizing the service with ads? That is a bit of a turn off, with ads comes data gathering for sure no? it still has more features but signal is improving fast. i always keep both. It's been 8 days since we left the EU and I'm already personally inconvenienced by Brexit. What a result. Yeah.. just got it here in Spain too. iOS14.3. This is 100% illegal in EU according to GPDR. We will see. Compare the feature board... Its way behind telegram. (i use both signal and telegram) As far as I can tell Telegram is indeed open-source? That's certainly a valid thought. When reading [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/telegram-to-launch-an-ad-platform-as-it-approaches-500-million-users)'s report, it looks like it will only apply to channels, not direct messages or groups. So, all things considered, it doesn't sound very intrusive, and I doubt it will be a big turn off to many people. If this is what it takes to 1) keep Telegram going and 2) keep Telegram independent, then I can get behind that.

Quote from TechCrunch:

>Telegram has a social networking dimension. Our massive public one-to-many channels can have millions of subscribers each and are more like Twitter feeds. In many markets the owners of such channels display ads to earn money, sometimes using third-party ad platforms. The ads they post look like regular messages, and are often intrusive. ***We will fix this by introducing our own Ad Platform for public one-to-many channels*** I believe the EU update is different. Your pop up had 2 bullet points, all the images in the news have 3 So do I and there is no difference for a normal user. Their crypto engine is closed source and not verified unlike Signal which is completely open source. Yeah we dont have the ""partner with facebook"" point however afaik the terms are the same

Regardless, they arent allowed to block access to whatsapp behind anything like this even if it has been tweaked for the EU. It will have to remain completely optional [Weird, I definitely have three bullet points (in German)](https://i.imgur.com/3VBvImn.jpg) Uhh TBH I didn't noticed and I already closed the pop-up. Could another EU user post a screenshot of the pop-up? That would be interesting! Here, better explained than i could do:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/kukcrd/whatsapp_vs_signal_vs_telegram_heres_how_they/git2hl4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 There's no crypto engine now The terms are different.

Can someone explain how big this really is?

Doesn‚Äôt WhatsApp already collect metadata that‚Äôs shared with Facebook? What‚Äôs new about this? Has it gotten worse for my privacy and in what ways?

My entire family life, social life and school life runs on WhatsApp so it‚Äôs not like I can just quit it. A lot of people I know are on telegram but it isn‚Äôt E2E encrypted. So switching to any other platform will take some time until I convince everyone else to switch.

I don't see any real privacy infringement here. This is too panicky. E2E basically means they can't monitor your conversations, so it's not ""everything"". But if you're worried about them monitoring when you're online, who you talk to, who you call, etc... it's Facebook. They've been doing that for years, because their metadata isn't encrypted. the only thing i wanna know are they going to start grabbing stuff off my internal memory and start uploading it to Facebook for ""analysis""?

Manually disabled this feature all you need is go to your cell provider get a new sim with your old number and put it in a new phone. oh yeah so I actually assumed I would have a new number.... didn't realise I could keep the same number with a new SIM....that would make life a lot easier.

I have been receiving these messages from random numbers around the world. The message just says ""i need help"".

From one number i received a call after they sent the same message and I answered but there was only silence.

Now my question is, if anyone else has faced this? If so do shsre yiur experience. I have tried to search on Google but no real information about this particular scam/spam.

Appreciate your responses.";2021-01-06 03:08:32;"Report the spam number and block them. There is no work around. I have been doing that. However I am keen to understand how the scam works. Also will only answering a WhatsApp call. Compromise security? Answering will not compromise security as long as you don't give any important information.

At most if will just flag your WhatsApp account as a good target for spamming since you answered the call. At worst you'll just experience more spam messages/calls :/ Since I started advertising my business number through Google. I have been receiving these messages. It's quite unfortunate. Thanks for the reassurance that answering call doesn't really do anything. It's probably a bot that found your number and shared it with spammer databases. Sorry that happened :(
I hope your business is doing well with everything going on though! Thanks for asking. Trying a new business of digital marketing. Hopefully this will work. The original travel business is definitely not making it anymore until cov8d goes away. Hope you are doing well as well. I feel like now is a prime time for that kind of thing for sure.

Yes thankfully. I'm a software engineer, so I've just been working from the comfort of home üëç"

Is whatsapp going the instagram route?;43;kr4cek;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/fl3kycs14k961.png;50;;2021-01-05 21:26:27;"Of course it is, it's a Facebook product. If they can profit off of your data or metadata, they will. Zuckerberg needs a second mansion, after all. wish I could just move, things are moving for the worst really quick Most likely, yes, since they are both owned by Facebook. [https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/04/app-privacy-labels-messaging-apps/](https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/04/app-privacy-labels-messaging-apps/)  


App privacy labels show stark contrasts among messaging apps Just click not now Don‚Äôt know whats the problem if they want to use your data for making some money if you are using their service for free Oh I mean don't update Wait, you mean he doesn't have one already?? I myself am considering moving to [Signal](https://signal.org/install). 
It seems to have much better privacy policies. Why can't you? Users will lose whatsapp access it they don't agree by February 8 It will also get paid in a few months it's not a problem

the problem it's Facebook

that's the problem

WORSE Than Huawei Not an option, you have to agree on 8 Februari at the latest someone should do something extremist towards that person before it's too late yea Most of them are not going to change from Whatsapp

edit: damn so many replies Oh lol Man i clicked ""not now"" only once, abd bow its not asking again, what do i do? I don‚Äôt think they will make this mistake of making it paid service though other version for business can be made as paid service Source? Where do you live? I uninstalled Whatsapp on January 1st. Most of my frequent contacts are available on Telegram. Wait till it prompts again on feb 8. It will prompt before Feb 8 Hope so Not fully paid but something known as whatsapp Insurance I‚Äôm 100% thinking on switching to telegraph I switched to telegram like a year ago, now hardly use whatsapp and only for the diehard friends/family, I moved away from instagram and facebook a LONG time ago, kudos telegram is crap too and will ban you for wrongthink, use Signal instead It's more of a matter of them being ignorant

Telegram is not better btw, maybe signal or something is what people should use, Telegram is almost as bad as Facebook this is the real strategy here Telegram is a bad place. its not me shifting to telegram, every other friends need to change upto telegram else no point init Sources? Not at all, telegram isn't plagued by ads, you probably haven't used facebook much to know the difference Agree I use Telegram everyday since 2017 because of cryptocurrencies but its policy is shite too, only Signal has free speech nah, people should just use social media messages or something, why the hell do we have to provide our phone numbers? :/ it's just an annoying thing Lots of people say that but I haven't heard any arguments besides ""you have to switch on encrypted chats."" Well guess what, I just switch on encrypted chats. It takes literally 3 seconds. mind explaining why? Your friends are probably saying the same. 
It should start with someone ;) Exactly whatsapp doesn't have ads??

edit: Oh, I said facebook. I meant facebook as a company, not the website I use telegram. What do you mean by only Signal gas free speech? 3 reasons

1. They messed up a bunch in the past, one of the things they did in the past was sync all your contacts even if you tell them to not do that. This was a bug for a while, they managed to fix it but didn't do anything to help people who were already affected. The only way to remove the contacts from telegram's database is to download the mobile app too. You also didn't have any good way to know this was fixed

2. insert third reason I forgot because I got distracted into verifying the thing about encryption

3. we don't talk about second reason (I didn't forget, it's just dumb)

**Regarding telegram being bad, yeah this looks mediocre, can't even lie to you. I have horrible memory.**

Regarding people complaining about encryption:

People focus on encryption because they expect all chats to be encrypted by default (I guess something or someone told them that), then they get mad when they find out they never were. Makes sense why would you get mad, you just discussed private info on clear text, who is to blame? I dunno, I don't relate to them and I didn't care about privacy and security back when I first started using it. Maybe because whatsapp does encryption by default? (Telegram has reasons to not do it by default). Maybe telegram was not clear about this, or maybe people expect everything to be encrypted, I have no way to know. They have every right to get mad no matter what, they expected something and didn't get it, the only problem is that then people may be irrational (and also if telegram is responsible for giving this expectation)

I blame them for letting this encryption argument spread, I don't think they had ever told people why they don't encrypt everything by default, if they just told people why maybe they would get less hate when it comes to that. Instead their users have to do the explanation: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/117858/why-does-telegram-not-use-end-to-end-encryption It‚Äôs got worse encryption and privacy than WhatsApp. Signal is a far more secure and private solution. telegram bans wrongthink and misunderstood translations Yes, but signal has hardly got any functionality. The desktop client keeps crashing on me, and there are too few emojis, stickers and no gifs. Telegram is the perfect middle ground for me. Telegram is used by antivaxxers, flat and hollow earthers and holocaust deniers. None of them are being censored for it. I don't condone their claims but I think you're making stuff up. Telegram is clearly unregulated in terms of free speech. I switched to signal and can use emojies, stickers, and gifs"
Whatsapp should add Spotify status like in discord;3;kr3lr2;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/n5udsul7yj961.jpg;6;;2021-01-05 20:53:42;No. Why its a good feature Discord was made with a center around profiles.

There is no security issue who's gona know by Spotify profile...and there should be option to turn it on or off...its ones choice to apply it Agreed I don't care about the privacy of it, I just meant it wouldn't make sense in the design of the app. Where would it show? Somewhere very hidden? What's the point of it then? Or just radically redesign the app? That'll just turn people away.

Just for this screen, updated TOS, Facebook integration, no thanks.;34;kqkksz;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/qj21f6xxde961.jpg;26;;2021-01-05 02:11:10;"This is my biggest concern.  Are they saying that any text or pictures you upload using WhatsApp can be used by WhatsApp without limitation?

Your License To WhatsApp. In order to operate and provide our Services, you grant WhatsApp a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, display, and perform the information (including the content) that you upload, submit, store, send, or receive on or through our Services. I've been moving away from all things Facebook lately.  It's the signal messenger for me from now on. This is what I read so I'm not sure why the concern:

""We joined Facebook in 2014. WhatsApp is now part of the Facebook family of companies. Our Privacy Policy explains how we work together to improve our services and offerings, like fighting spam across apps, making product suggestions, and showing relevant offers and ads on Facebook. Nothing you share on WhatsApp, including your messages, photos, and account information, will be shared onto Facebook or any of our other family of apps for others to see, and nothing you post on those apps will be shared on WhatsApp for others to see.
Your messages are yours, and we can‚Äôt read them. We‚Äôve built privacy, end-to-end encryption, and other security features into WhatsApp. We don‚Äôt store your messages once they‚Äôve been delivered. When they are end-to-end encrypted, we and third parties can‚Äôt read them.
No third-party banner ads. We still do not allow third-party banner ads on WhatsApp.""

And further down....

""The choices you have. If you are an existing user, you can choose not to have your WhatsApp account information shared with Facebook to improve your Facebook ads and products experiences. Existing users who accept our updated Terms and Privacy Policy will have an additional 30 days to make this choice by going to Settings > Account.""

You can presently download a copy of your account info which takes 3 days to process if you are curious what I assume would be shared with Facebook of you accept terms and do not opt out of sharing. I'm still trying to figure out what the new updates are... In case you don‚Äôt believe this statement, look for your self.

https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service

Expand Licenses, and check the 3rd item called ‚ÄúYour License to WhatsApp‚Äù,

Why he hell does this TOS need to be this hard to read, no wonder people sign all those disclaimers without reading. Like telegram? Don't forget end to end encryption tho [deleted] I pressed Accept on accident yesterday and still can‚Äôt find the option to opt out in Settings>Privacy... it‚Äôs a lie It‚Äôs extremely cryptic (As TOS are by design so people don‚Äôt read the).

Guess WhatsApp is now part of ‚ÄúThe Facebook Company‚Äù, and it states.

‚ÄúIn addition to the services offered by Facebook Inc. and Facebook Ireland Ltd, Facebook owns and operates each of the companies listed below, in accordance with their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We may share information about you within our family of companies to facilitate, support and integrate their activities and improve our services. For more information on the Facebook Companies‚Äô privacy practices and how they treat individuals‚Äô information, please visit the following links‚Äù Yeah, I'm trying to figure that out too...

It is an awful big notification for nothing of substance to change. Essentially they will allow Facebook to see your WhatsApp account information afaik (no chats images etc. Just account info like phone number). You have 30 days to opt out once you accept. I imagine account information is defined in the tos. To be fair, I think the whole context is needed. I don't know if this was there before but it says after that in the same paragraph.

""The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating and providing our Services (such as to allow us to display your profile picture and status message, transmit your messages, store your undelivered messages on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver them, and otherwise as described in our Privacy Policy).""

Seems like they need it for standard WhatsApp functionality, such as displaying your picture and stored messages (which should be encrypted). A shitty E2E implementation with unencrypted cloud backups on Google Drive for Android and iCloud on iPhones. I was able to get older family members to use Signal since they are on Android, easy to give them a single app for SMS and Signal together, they don‚Äôt see the difference other than some text message being one color versus another, they don‚Äôt even understand what Encryption is, but now they use it natively amongst them self‚Äôs.

I have also told some friends co-workers that I‚Äôm losing my WhatsApp in February and that I will be on Signal, some close friends installed Signal. WhatsApp was bought by Facebook on 2014... Since then, they are the same company basically. It‚Äôs a lot more than that ‚Äúnon-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, display, and perform the information‚Äù Wow, lots of misinformation here!

\> A shitty E2E implementation

It's actually state of the art

\> unencrypted cloud backups 

Nope! Backups are encrypted. Download and check for yourself. Also, you don't have to use cloud backups if you don't want to All that wording is so you can't charge them for keeping your data in their servers. It sounds awful, though, and I understand the concern, specially since Facebook had privacy issues in the past nd WhatsApp belongs to Facebook. The backup are unencrypted, it literally says ‚ÄúYour back up are not protected by WhatsApp end-to-end encryption‚Äù in the Chat Backup window.

How good is an E2E when if any person on the conversation has the backup enabled, that those messages are stored unencrypted on a 3rd party server, shifty E2E implementation. > It's actually state of the art

It was when it was implemented. From that point onward, nobody had the option of checking to see if it's intact. Until Signal goes back and confirms their encryption is still standing, it's not wise to put trust into a closed-source app owned by Facebook. Not that I trust FB in any way, but as a legal contract those two paragraphs have to be read together and it's not as if they can just decide to ignore the second one. 

The ""limited purpose"" they state is what they are allowed to use your data for, if they use it for anything else they would be opening themselves up to lawsuits - and quite likely criminal charges in many jurisdictions.

That said, most people won't read the terms and if they were to change them in the future (i.e., removing the part about ""limited purpose""), most people would likely not even notice, and just click accept. It says they are not protected by end to end encryption. That is not the same thing as not being protected by encryption at rest. Again, you can go verify that it's encrypted for yourself by inspecting the backup. >nobody had the option of checking to see if it's intact

Simply untrue. There are literally dozens of fake clients made by people who have reverse-engineered the client code and needed to implement the encryption protocols themselves. The whole point of E2E is that it doesn't matter what the server is doing - the message is verifiably secure with only the information the client has. Agreed, I don't see anything extraordinary from reading this. In fact, those two sections are part of the same paragraph. I don't think taking one section of it is fair which is why I posted the latter part of the paragraph because it provides more information, which is required, in my opinion, to fully understand the section. It's not just about client-side code though. If WhatsApp runs malicious code on their servers or gets a copy of the encryption keys, it can easily spy on users. We have no idea what the WhatsApp servers are running, nobody but them does. Server side malicious code is irrelevant. That's the whole point of e2e"

How Whatsapp video call differ from Skype?;1;kpwlo4;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kpwlo4/how_whatsapp_video_call_differ_from_skype/;0;"Hello there, so directly to point, i often use video call to my girlfriend which stay at same ISP network like me in same region, so we have direct connection. My problem whatsapp video calls are very painfully, low quality video, constant video freezing and audio drops making it looks like our 100mb fiber connection looks like 56kbps from dial-up.

Using Skype on the other way video quality and audio become much better, video stay at reasonable quality, while audio dont make drop outs like whatsapp video calls do.  


My guess is Skype using some better background connection architecture or maintaining some servers at my own country, which maybe whatsapp servers are from outside, causing this much connection delay, looking calling from another side of the world? Or there can be something else messing around? Is whatsapp calls client-server or p2p model?";2021-01-04 03:12:55;

Was my WhatsApp accessed by someone else? (Details below);3;kpsh8j;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kpsh8j;6;;2021-01-03 23:37:01;"Here‚Äôs what happened:
From maybe yesterday morning to 3:20pm today I received no messages on WhatsApp.
Then at 3:20pm today about 50 messages come through at once.
(People who sent them to me say they didn‚Äôt deliver until 3:20pm today).

Now at 8pm today, I have 2 text messages from ‚ÄòWhatsApp‚Äô saying the above (photo 2) the links in text messages say ‚Äòv.whatsapp.com/(6 digit code)‚Äô. 
And 2 notifications from WhatsApp (photo 1) saying they send a verification code I requested (I didn‚Äôt request one).

Other details:
I did not have 2 factor authentication set up, and just set it up now.
I checked WhatsApp web but my last login was in 2019 on my personal laptop. 

So 
1 how can I see if and where my WhatsApp was accessed on another device?
2 what do I do if I find out someone has accessed it? You've likely been hacked, I'd enable 2 factor authentication.

PLEASE ENABLE THIS I enabled it with a new 6 digit passcode as soon as I realised I might have been hacked. 
Do you know if I can find out what other devices accessed my WhatsApp and where they accessed from?
Also I don‚Äôt delete my chats but I do not back them up to the cloud, does that mean if someone accessed my WhatsApp on another device they‚Äôd get my chat history and media? Right, so I can't or anyone cannot track your devices (neither can you). Your chats should be safe since they're encrypted in YOUR DEVICE. 

If this happens again, I'd just change your number if I were you Ok, appreciate the help bro Anytime :)"

1. Buy a cheap prepaid SIM card and activate WhatsApp on your device using it.

2. Remove that SIM and replace it with your normal SIM.

3. Tell the people you want that for WhatsApp purposes your number is the other one. For calls and SMS your number is still the normal one.

4. Tell your co-workers you hate WhatsApp and have never activated it, that's why you don't appear as a contact in their app.

5. Don't let the prepaid SIM expire, otherwise the carrier will eventually allocate that number to another person and they will be able to active WhatsApp with it.

6. Enjoy.

Edit: alternatively, if you have a dual SIM phone, you can obviously use both SIMs simultaneously, but only one of them for WhatsApp. Smart, thanks!"

Yes, you can download the image preview, but the quality will be so bad because the previews have a 100x100 or similar resolution so when you try to send it, it will look too pixelated.

I accidentally lost all of my Whatsapp chat with a person, but they still have all of our conversations going back several years, and sent me a plain.txt file of the entire chat log. I ***can*** read the conversation like this, but it's.... hard. Are there any viewing tools that can properly display a formatted view of a Whatsapp backup on a computer?

Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you!";2021-01-01 05:52:27;"I have never seen any program which does that but I could try and make one Yes you can but you need root.

There's a whatsapp viewer app for PC.

[http://andreas-mausch.de/whatsapp-viewer/](http://andreas-mausch.de/whatsapp-viewer/)

[https://github.com/andreas-mausch/](https://github.com/andreas-mausch/)

You need your .crypt12 files and a ""key file"", which is the decryption key for those encrypted databases.

If you have root access to your phone, you need to find whastapp data (the one in the phone data partition, not the one in the internal sd), for example for xioami phones that's in: /data/user/0/com.whatsapp/files

With that key file and the .crypt12 satabase, you can see the chats formated with the Andreas mausch software on PC.

On other phons the route where the ""key"" file is may be different. About the key file, it seems that there are non-root ways to get it but be careful with what you download from the web.

&#x200B;

PS: it should be obvious, but NEVER share your key file, with anyone. Well you'd have all the internet points from me. Wow, this is incredibly powerful, thank you.

Unfortunately, it's my ***friend*** who still has a copy of our chat. As such, I would have to do this rooting on her phone, and then somehow export/save the result for myself.

I wonder if there's a legit way for her to send me her encryption key so that i could decrypt the chat file on any device, or on my phone. how exactly did they generate the chat log so I can generate my own to test the program If you have a rootable, spare phone. You can install whatsapp on it and verify it with the phone number, and then extract the key.

If you do that, she will logged out of her phone. She has to wait until you finish extracting the key and then she can reverify the number on her phone. If she do that without deleting/canceling nothing, she shouldnt lose any info (except by the messages received while you verified it and she reverified it).

Without root on any phone, seems that you at least, need bootloader unlocked. Since i have root, i have not explored the other options, so i cant help you there and dont even know if it's possible at all.

If you get access to a rooted phone, i advise you to get the key of your whatsapp too (for future use) and then save it somewhere safe (eg compressed with winrar with password). I'll ask and get back to you -- probably tomorrow Alright so I asked, and her export was very straightforward.

In a chat, click the \[ ... \] at the top right, then More > Export Chat > Export with or Without Media

She did a ""without media"" export, and the result is a text file that displays conversation like this:

    2018-10-27, 6:17 p.m. - -Ty-: So the week after will be a break week
    2018-10-27, 6:17 p.m. - Friend: Wooo
    2018-10-27, 6:17 p.m. - -Ty-: And I've been dying to get there, I'm so sick of it
    2018-10-27, 6:18 p.m. - -Ty-: But at the same time, I'm basically done all of my projects now
    2018-10-27, 6:18 p.m. - -Ty-: So that week will be nothing

All I'm really looking for is a way to display the text in a left-side/right-side sort of way, putting them into word bubbles like any of today's chat applications, just to make it visually easier to read. I wouldn't mind using my own (old) phone for this, as I have a fresh backup of everything should the rooting process go sideways somehow.

So just to make sure I'm understanding this correctly, the encryption key for Whatsapp is stored both locally, but ALSO server-side.... so if I root my phone, install Whatsapp, and then set up the Whatsapp using HER phone number, it will ping the servers and say ""Hey, I'm a fresh install of WhatsApp, Can I have a copy of the encryption key for \[Friend\]'s phone number?"" and then download a copy of the encryption key?

Once I do this, I can then manually copy the encryption key file over to, say, a desktop or whatever, then Un-root my phone, re-set-up Whatsapp on MY phone number... and then what? I use the Andreas-Mausch viewer to view her backup file using that copied encryption key?

Is my understanding correct? Ok thanks I'll let you know how it goes. If you don't hear from me in a few days then reply so I get a notification üëç >So just to make sure I'm understanding this correctly, the encryption key for Whatsapp is stored both locally, but ALSO server-side.... so if I root my phone, install Whatsapp, and then set up the Whatsapp using HER phone number, it will ping the servers and say ""Hey, I'm a fresh install of WhatsApp, Can I have a copy of the encryption key for \[Friend\]'s phone number?"" and then download a copy of the encryption key?

I don't know if it saved server side or if it's generated based on the phone number, but the key will be the same.

However you need the .crypt12 file (which are usually backups) not the exported chat which would be plain text.

Also that .crypt12 file won't have just your chat with her but all her conversations with everybody.

To only give you your chat, she would need to:

* First save a back up (that will contain all her chats).
* Then put the whole whatsapp folder aside (eg copy it to a PC)\*\*
* Then delete all chats except yours.

* Then clear whatsapp data.
* Then copy the folder from the PC back to her phone.
* Then re verify her phone and use the first backup to restore all her chats.

\*\*That's cause if she only saves the .crypt12 files, probably she will lose the media (images, videos and stickers), so backing up the whole folder is better.

Disable message popup window notifications;1;knzf5h;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/knzf5h/disable_message_popup_window_notifications/;0;"I am using a Samsung Galaxy S8 running stock Verizon Android 9.

Whenever I get a message I get an intrusive window that pops up on top and blocks whatever I'm doing. I want to disable that popup window but still want to be notified of messages in the notification bar like every other app, not as a separate popup window. I am not trying to mute message notifications altogether.

&#x200B;

I have tried:

\- Ensuring my Android and WhatsApp are the latest versions available

\- (WhatsApp) Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Messages ‚Üí Popup notification ‚Üí No popup

\- (WhatsApp) Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Messages ‚Üí Use high priority notifications ‚Üí off

\- (Android) Settings ‚Üí Advanced features ‚Üí Smart pop-up view ‚Üí WhatsApp ‚Üí off

\- (WhatsApp) Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Messages ‚Üí  Message notifications ‚Üí Notification style ‚Üí Silent

\- Turning all of the above features on, then off again

\- Restarting WhatsApp, rebooting phone

\- Uninstalling the app and redoing all of the above

\- Searching on Google, WhatsApp support forums, and Reddit for other ideas

None of these settings has any effect on removing the popup window. I see the same results for private messages and group messages and have tried separately changing the settings for each.";2021-01-01 01:23:44;

issues restoring android backup;1;knut9d;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/knut9d/issues_restoring_android_backup/;0;"-i have a backup on google.  
-i switched from an android phone to an iphone
-i still have the android which has no cellular provider
-i have the same phone number
-putting my phone number into the iphone kicked me off the android
-i now have no chat history on either phone
-i cannot get into what's app on the android phone as i can't get past the phone number verification.  it says 'we will be verifying the number ***-***-****, is this ok or would you like to edit the number?'  i select 'ok' and it takes me back into the enter your phone number loop.
  -i receive no messages on my iphone

i assume there is a security protocol between platforms blocking the verification message as its being requested from an android through wifi destined for an iphone on cellular data.

i am completely locked out of my chat history.

ideally i want to import my history to my iphone, i feel the first step is being able to restore my history from google to my android, which i cannot do because of the verification.

any ideas are most welcome.  there is a lot of data i do not want to lose.  

do i have to switch my number back to the android phone to do the restore from google?  that seems there must be a better  way.  the store is 30 miles away.

tldr: can't restore data from google backup to android as the phone number is now attached to an iphone";2020-12-31 21:03:49;

On the FAQ it says its possible to restore from a local backup and I am wondering how to go about this. I am thinking of doing as follows-

1. Install Whatsapp on a device 

2. Activate Whatsapp with my number

3. Locate the folder Whatsapp/Database 

4. Copy msgstore-YYYY-MM-DD.1.db.crypt12 on it and rename it as msgstore.db.crypt12 

5. Uninstall Whatsapp and reinstall Whatapp. When it asks about backup. Tell it to use the local back up.

Does this make sense? Does this have to be done on the same device or can I copy the database to another device and have it work?";2020-12-30 20:50:51;Yes it makes sense and you can copy it to another device and have it work just like a normal backup does

She added the wrong number and apologized but then is asking to be friends.

I‚Äôm playing dumb to see when the scam is but I asked her how she got my number and I‚Äôm kinda confused by all this and she ends up calling me on WhatsApp to say it‚Äôs her. I pick up and sure as shit, it‚Äôs an Asian accent with a hint of German, she said she spoke German as well. 

We spoke for a bit but I had to hang up since I had work. I‚Äôm still really confused but I wanna play dumb to see if it is a scam and when I‚Äôll get some sort of link or something. She even offered to video chat with me which I found interesting. 

She asked for my name and I gave a fake name obviously but we‚Äôre having great conversations so I‚Äôm like super confused. 

She keeps asking me to come visit for the spring festival (half jokingly) but that‚Äôs when I realize maybe I‚Äôll lose an organ or two lol. Maybe that‚Äôs the scam lol. She comes from a wealthy family it seems and would even offer to pay for my hotel. 

Obviously I‚Äôd never go, but I‚Äôm playing dumb to see wtf. I reversed image searched her photo to see if it was taken from somewhere else but nothing came up so it could be genuine but it‚Äôs super random.

Update: it was a scam in the end haha. It was for me to join a forex trading platform and she was going to teach me how to make money and use a demo account first and then when I‚Äôm ready and when I want to, I can deposit money to begin on my own. When I googled ‚Äòforex trading scam‚Äô a bunch of stuff came up from exactly as my experience, wealthy/attractive Hong Kong women trying to videochat with you and talk with you and be nice for a few days then ask you what you do and then bring up how they made all this money with some forex strategy lol.

I have zero intention of ever seeing this person lol You can just get a VPN in China to get around this Yea, for that would be a minimum requirement is her real name, phone number and the Adresse -  can ask my friend to stop by to check if she exists lol üòÇ [deleted] Some VPN apps are still on playstore"

I received this question from someone in my family, but didn't know the answer because I've never heard of such a thing. Even with a Google search, I do not really find anything about it.

There is apparently on Android the possibility to connect an external camera via USB and then make this USB camera available in WhatsApp via a third party app. But for iPhones I haven't found anything.

You're in luck though: according to WABetaInfo, video calling is coming to WhatsApp web and desktop: https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-calls-available-on-whatsapp-web-desktop/

Edited to add: this is a repost of a comment I made deeper down one of the threads, made at the top level for visibility. Why not just use WhatsApp web or WhatsApp desktop? Blue stacks is not a mirroring app. nah Nah, at first this is what I used for WhatsApp Screen mirroring is not against any of WhatsApp's terms of service that I'm aware of. You will be fine. No, WhatsApp usually bans for using alternative clients. Bluestacks just emulates a phone so you'd be using an official WhatsApp client, they couldn't detect it. Sounds exactly what I'd need. How long ago did you post that? Because they use Messanger and my gf had issues because she couldn't use the front camera with messanger, so it's a no go for me (unless I find a solution to that) I saw some people claiming that WA consents only one access from a device and everytime you use another device it asks you to put your phone number again, so if you do this too often it seems suspicious and get banned. You think this is not true?
Just trying to understand I saw some people claiming that WA consents only one access from a device and everytime you use another device it asks you to put your phone number again, so if you do this too often it seems suspicious and get banned. You think this is not true?

Just trying to understand I'm not affiliated with WABetaInfo but that article was posted a couple of weeks ago. What? Have you even tried them? The one device at a time is true. Maybe they'll give a warning or something of you rapidly change devices. I think it's not illegal or anything Well, please explain what you mean by ""mirror phone display"". As far as I know, Bluestacks is an emulator. That is true. Using BlueStacks alone won't get you banned, but constantly changing devices might cause you problems Yeah that's true, I think you should just use the Whastapp Web app on pc then Yes, this refers only to primary devices (ie your phone). You currently cannot use WhatsApp on more than one phones at a time. But screen mirroring and the WhatsApp web and desktop programs are all allowed. I looked up bluestacks and it's not a screen mirror app, it's an android emulator. This means it acts like another phone, and indeed swapping between two devices may get your account suspended.

Edit: also going to post this as a top level comment. Yes, as I said they use Messanger Rooms but I got issues with that You think I'd be good if I do this once a week?

Thanks I thought it was only a mirror app, I got confused What do you mean they use messanger? They don't, you just need to scan a code with your phone and you're using WhatsApp on your computer. Once week maybe a bit too noticing. If I was at whatsapp, I'd do something to check on you Yes, but if you want to videocall they use Messanger Rooms.
I wanted the call to be on my pc screen and be easy to access for everyone without using otger app becase we found that WA calls have better servers than most videocall apps"

Notification issues on Galaxy S20;1;km407f;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/km407f/notification_issues_on_galaxy_s20/;1;"I bought a Galaxy S20 a few weeks ago and started using Whatsapp in a more active way.
Since this new phones do not have the LED indicator I've been used to in older phones, I needed some kind of way to see if I received a message or a notification instantly.

So I found out the lateral ilumination notificaton set up they have on the S20 and found it interesting. So I setted it up the same way fo every single app I have and it worked wonders. I even setted the effect to last the maximum possible (just a few seconds, like 10s or so) just to be able to read or see the notification if I had the phone near me.

The issue is that the Whatsapp notification just pops and it lasts around 1 sec and I can barely see it. All the other apps have it working normally, includind Messenger, Facebook, Youtube, the own Message service from the phone and stuff.

In whatsapp it just blinks and goes dark again no matter what I do.

It's a bit annoying because sometimes I just want to read the notification as it pops and I'm just unable.

Just wanna know if someone has or had similar issues with this particular phone (or any other).
I have all notification priority set as high and have all enabled as well.";2020-12-29 04:32:06;"So, after some research it seems this happens because Power Saving Mode is active (which explains why I never receive Gmail notifications whenever I have the power saving mode activated). I tested it for a while without the power saving feature and it worked wonders.

I also changed the lateral effect and it worked for a while but then it came back to the 1second display, which sucks.

Is there a way to override this or do  I really have to chose between battery life and real time notifications showing up properly?"

banned for no reason;5;kll0w5;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kll0w5/banned_for_no_reason/;4;"Very certain I've never violated any ToS or spammed anyone or done anything that would get me reported.

I believe the mistake is due to me being added to a stranger/spam group but I just ignore the group and did not leave/report the group thus probably mistakenly reported since I‚Äôm in the member list of the spam group.

so Basically, a SPAMMER ADDS ME and I GET BANNED for ignoring the spammer?

Customer support are all just automated replies too so pretty much means its useless.

Alright so it means people can just get random people banned just by getting a few friends and reporting random numbers for fun?

Like seriously wth. Whatsapp doesn't even check if reports are legit and just proceeds to ban people.";2020-12-28 09:29:41;"Am i not getting legit replies from whatsapp because its the weekend? Or do they just don't have humans working on the customer support line. yeah whatsapp support is a joke, although when i got banned a year ago all i had to do was email whatsapp support and they unbanned me. But they only do that once per account. Yes, you can get banned if someone adds you to a group that then gets banned.  Or if you're in a group and someone changes the name, and the group gets banned.  Or if a bunch of people get together to report you.

There is a setting in WhatsApp to restrict the number of people who can add you to a group, but I think the lowest setting is ""contacts"".

It's possible that the ban may be temporary. You may not be able to contact them.  Each of these huge tech companies is supporting 300 million to 3 billion free accounts with maybe 500 to 2000 Support people, most of whom are fighting abuse/spam or supporting advertisers who pay money.  The last thing they want is for a normal user to be able to contact a human in their company, they'd be overwhelmed."

What to do if I have a WhatsApp virus?;1;kl63kn;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kl63kn/what_to_do_if_i_have_a_whatsapp_virus/;5;"Hey,
I have stupidly clicked on a link sent to me, to be greeted by a virus.
What can I do to get rid of it urgently?

Thanks in advance :)";2020-12-27 19:08:49;"if you only clicked on a link, you probably didnt get any virus. 

if you got a pop-up message on that website saying something like ""your phone is infected with 23 viruses, download this antivirus"", just close the website, nothing to worry about.

if you installed something, you can probably check Settings - Apps and see if you find anything suspicious. I clicked before the virus, of course.
My sister called me and said I have sent her a message with a link, and told me that a lot of her friends (in my contacts) got the message as well. check Settings - Apps and see if you find anything suspicious.

another thing i would try is installing a trusted, known anti-malware app (like Malwarebytes Security) and do a scan.

last option would be a factory reset, after you saved your important files on a PC. That actually happened to me several years ago while I still had a Facebook. It's a scam, not a virus though, so I don't think you need to worry. You can, of course, download a reputable virus scanner (not required most of the time due to Google Play Protect). The people the message was sent to will still probable be pissed off lol. Just remember not to click sus links. I‚Äôll try, thanks :)"

Weird Interference;1;kku2wx;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kku2wx/weird_interference/;0;"First of all this is a genuine request for help, not a creepypasta or spam or a prank or anything. I truly do not understand how this interference is occurring. 

The first time it happened someone whispered my name while I was in a call with my mum. The only app opened was WhatsApp. My mum was the only one in the room and I was just opening my door to enter my house. There was no one else around. I asked my mum if she heard it and she hadn't. 

Second time it happened was Christmas morning, I'd called home while walking my dog to wish them a Merry Christmas. This time throughout my walk I could hear whispering that my sister couldn't. I don't know what the whispering was saying but it kept cutting into my phonecall with my sister, like there was a really clear break in the connection so I put it down to connection issues. Until whoever it was clearly called me a CUNT?? Which is definitely not something my Sister, Mum and 75 year old Gran would call me on Christmas day. 

The third time it happened to my sister and not me. I didn't hear the interference but it seriously freaked my sister out to the point where we've switched to calling via  some Google service or through traditional mobile phone services. We where both at home with decent Internet connections and up until the interference kicked in we could hear each other perfectly. 

I know this sounds like a stupid creepypasta or that I'm hearing things or that my family is playing a massive prank on me. 

But I don't get how they could change their voice the way they did or the audio quality to and from what I was hearing so seamlessly? 

I checked the second and last time it happened and I had full bars. 

Is there any way this would be possible? Is my phone compromised? I switched phones between the first and second times it happened and I've ran security on both phones with no negative results. 

This is legitimately quite scary and my sister is freaked out over it so if anyone can provide any advice or suggestions it would be much appreciated. 

If it happens again I'll try and get a recording of it. 

TLDR:
Weird creepy feedback on WhatsApp calls with sister.

Perhaps you're trying to video call your bf using WhatsApp? That would only work if your bf has WhatsApp installed.

If you're starting the call from outside WhatsApp, your phone operating system might be choosing which way to video call, which might be why it only works sometimes.

The best way to I can think of to check if someone has a WhatsApp account is to send them a text message inside of WhatsApp and see if they respond. I mean it shows FaceTime and WhatsApp as a video option and he says he doesn‚Äôt have WhatsApp but it‚Äôs showing as if he does so is he cheating on me .... or ...... If your husband's contact sheet in iOS offers you the ability to make a WhatsApp call, then he does have WhatsApp installed. It wouldn't be an option if he didn't have an account.

That doesn't mean he's cheating on you but, yeah... You can try to call him trough WhatsApp and then confront him with is lie to make things clear between you."

So while my mother gave me her cell phone and bought another, so I formatted the cell phone and put my chip to be able to communicate by phone, this without opening WhatsApp, but a problem occurred and that is that my mother was nosy and without my permission He got on my cell phone that he gave me and opened whattsapp and put in the data my phone and as a recovery account (alaurentdela\*\*\*\*\*\*@gmail.com) on December 23, so there are no longer my old conversations, which makes me very frustrated with her, so I ask for your help to help me with assistance to know what will happen when I can turn on my old phone again, can I put my data and recover my old messages stored in the cache or memory from my cell phone? Do I have to follow a different methodology? Can I hire or pay for an assistance service with my case?

Please I need help to make sure I can get my information back when I resuscitate my old phone, and I would appreciate if you could contact me.

Recovering photos from WhatsApp iCloud Backup;1;kk3ise;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kk3ise/recovering_photos_from_whatsapp_icloud_backup/;1;" \*moved here because post was deleted on apple subreddit\*

About   18 months ago I had an iPhone 6S that went bust, through all my  efforts  I couldn;t fix it and had to settle and buy a new android as  that was  all I could afford at the time. I forgot about the iphone and  went about  my life

Anyway,  looking back now I  want to recover some photos I'm missing from over  the years. I had  WhatsApp backup active, but I don't think at the time I  saved every  single photo I received from WhatsApp into my actual Photo  Galley to be  backed up on icloud photos(depending on the person who  sent it), but it  saved around 800 photos and videos but there are a  plethora of videos  and photos that I am sure I am missing.

If I could access my 6S I could gain access to it but I can't get it to work, which begs the questioon

If   I get a new iPhone, and I recover the chat (which backdates from May   2016 to May 2019), would it be possible to still recover the photos from   the messages I received or am I shit out of luck?

According   to my iCloud Whatsapp backup has taken up 1.8gb of space but I am not   sure if that is just the actual messages or the photos and videos are   included too

If anyone could give   me an answer I'd really appreciate it, I'm just holding onto my iPhone   6S if it can miraculously work and switch on again.

Merry Christmas";2020-12-25 21:25:49; Merry Christmas! As I know, WhatsApp will backup both the chats and the media files to iCloud.  So you just need to verify WhatsApp Messenger again with the same number on iPhone and then choose to restore from iCloud. Then you will be able to view the photos on iPhone.

Disable background data usage, also.

Whatsapp backups;1;kjwj0a;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kjwj0a/whatsapp_backups/;5;So if u delete ur messages on whatsapp they still are on backups which means the police could restore those and read the messages. But will they still able to restore messages if I delete those backups?;2020-12-25 12:42:05;"It's best to setup 2FA, if messages getting restored, are your concern. When WhatsApp has a fresh login, before the main area of the messages. You can use 2FA to access that area Whats a 2FA? Also are they still restorable after I deleted the backups? 2FA is Two Factor Authentication. Which can be setup within WhatsApp, it's a 4 digit code. So if WhatsApp is unistalled, and setup again. The code needs to be inputted to access messages.

Messages are restorable, if you have the backup with Google Drive. But as I've mentioned, if you have 2FA activated. The main message screen, cannot be accessed. Without the code Is there any way to delete messages completly? Like that they are not restorable on my phone? For example if police got my phone so that they cant restore it. On Google Drive, in the top left corner. You'll see an icon with 3 horizontal lines. Click the lines, then you'll get a list of items. One of which, is backups. Click backups, then you'll see the WhatsApp Backup File. Click the 3 vertical dots, next to WhatsApp. Then onto, delete backup"

Any help much appreciated.";2020-12-25 07:19:51;"Change your name and move to Canada This happened to me. I got my account back after the 12 hours. In the meanwhile, you should:

1) contact your friends and family to warn them 
2) email WhatsApp to deactivate your account 
3) set a timer for when you can get a verification code again and the second you can do it, get your account back Hi Op. This has happened to my wife today too, only she was hacked via a missed call from California and a falsified confirmation link from WhatsApp requesting PIN. Wife was hungover and clicked the link and entered the pin. Hackers are now working through contacts via code requests. We arent receiving the SMS codes to re-access the account. Have told Police and local phone company. How do we tell Whatsapp to de-activate the account? Do you know and are you now clear? Setting up 2 step verification after having sent the otp is like adding another lock to your door after you had already let a stranger into your home. He's already there. Yeah managed to get it back once the 12hrs were up, sneaky bastard sending those types of messages on Christmas eve night when they know people are likely to be drunk! Hi mate, did she have two step verification set up? Think activating that before I was logged out saved me a lot of hassle. I had to wait till the 12hr block was over then could log back in using the new sms pin and my two step pin and now everything is normal. 
I emailed support@WhatsApp.com support asking them to deactivate my account. Tell them your number with country code and no spaces. Based on what? I have sent messages to my number from various friends accounts and none have gone through to two ticks. Also, I received the email requesting my two step verification be removed so I'd assume that's because whoever has taken my account can't get through, or am I reading the situation wrong?

I wasn't logged out of my account until hours after sending the OTP. I figured you might have already gotten it back, but thought I'd reply just in case. My hacker is now threatening me with a virus lol. Anyone can gain access to any whatsapp account that hadn't enabled 2SV, if they get their hands on the otp sent to a phone number. This doesn't involve any ""hacking"".

 Enabling 2SV after the other person had already recieved access to your account doesn't do anything but you'll be locked out of your own account after a while. Wouldn't I be immediately logged out once they use the OTP?"

I don't know if the email played a part, but it's worth sending. She's got her WhatsApp back since yesterday morning If possible can you file cyber case about this issue? Usually you will get an automated answer and you need to reply to that so that a real person answers you. Ok. We will wait out the 12 hours and see if she can reaccess. God knows how many of her contacts will fall for the trick. I'm sorry I don't know what that is We posted warnings on Facebook and prevent damage as well as we could. I've called the people that were at risk the most (mother, mother in law, naive best friends) Hey did you manage to recover your account? This just happened to me and I‚Äôm not sure what to do Yes we did. Had to post on social media to ignore all requests and we logged back in on 12 hours after the breach. Moved to two step verification once we had account back. Sorry hungover. All requests from wifes account.

Help please! Anyone else have this problem?;2;kjbxkr;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kjbxkr/help_please_anyone_else_have_this_problem/;2;"So in short, I have an issue with the latest WhatsApp on IOS14. There is a toggle in the WhatsApp settings to ‚Äúsave to camera roll‚Äù which when enabled saves every picture you take in WhatsApp to the phone. However it seems that even when turned off this has no effect on the saving of photos to the phone. 

It‚Äôs terribly annoying as the photos I take within WhatsApp have no value to me after I send to the person intended. 

Does anyone know what‚Äôs going on? / experiencing the same issue?

Thanks guys";2020-12-24 11:38:19;"The save to camera roll function only applies to incoming media: https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/how-to-save-incoming-media

I'm not aware of a setting in WhatsApp to *not* save photos and videos you take yourself to your camera roll, but you might be able to do it by removing the iOS settings  that allows WhatsApp to access your photos. That will have other usability consequences though.

However, all photos WhatsApp saves go to the ""WhatsApp"" album so you can easily bulk delete them later if you want. Thanks for your feedback! Seems like quite an oversight especially considering that the photos taken in WhatsApp are of a terrible quality. 
I guess I‚Äôll have to go this route it seems.

Thanks again"

Lets hope he hasnt done any harm but please help if anyone knows what can I do;2020-12-24 06:18:45;"When you contact WhatsApp support make sure to mention that the account was hacked and you need the account to be locked and registration attempts reset.

Most times this happens when someone is tricked into giving away the six-digit code that comes via text message. Very often two-factor authentication will have been set up by the hackers so your dad will have to wait a week for that to expire as well, but as long as your dad keeps his six-digit code safe, the hackers won't be able to log into his account. Request a new sim card from your ISP and also email WhatsApp with the Gmail/iCloud account associated with your dad's WhatsApp backup. 

Once you activate WhatsApp, enable the 2 step pin verification. You can just wait out the timer and eventually you'll manage to take back control. When it happened to my wife WhatsApp support was next to useless, but after a few days of trying we eventually got the verification text and took back control.

She did already re-register and now she got back with her account, also turned on two-factor authentication now. 
The only thing we all scare from is what happened if the hacker had access with the media that she shared with other people ? 
If the hacker got access with all that media, this is a big trouble cause we have copies of our ID's and maybe even some bank account numbers (no passwords and secure numbers) we don't know how to secure that the hacker did not got with her media. No old messages or media will have been accessible to the hacker. Only new messages sent while the account was compromised would be visible to the hacker.

It's really important to never share the six digit codes with anyone, even if you trust them as it might be that your trusted friends account was hacked and it's the hacker asking you for the code. I know that believe me, however my mother probably think if a lady from France (we are not) asking for ""urgent help"" with sending those 6 digits is trustworthy enough to be true...We gave her a quick lesson of the 2021 media scams."

When restoring the messages,it takes forever,like 5 minutes maybe? Which i think is very long to wait for and also if i set my screen to sleep,it will stop restoring and i need to restore it again,its just i dont know how to make this thing stop.Other than the long time taken,the restoring process is fine Also,at one point,like maybe after a few weeks,my phone system would not allow me to open the app and i need to delete the app and install it again,and then the same process happen all over again. Ohhh okay, I'm met with a similar problem where I'll have this message pop up as well randomly, like in the middle of exchanging messages, and then I'll lose all the recent ones. Then as I begin to restore my preparing message bar would reach a certain percentage E.G. 35, and then drop down to 24... The only way I get the messages back is if I close the app as soon as it goes down, otherwise it also takes a long time, but will then only show me Group chats, with no chat history in then Ouh thats more severe problem than me

Taking a step back, though, the way the link preview works is different on each platform. It sounds like you're running into a condition that breaks the link preview on desktop but not on mobile.

Automatic daily backup bot working;1;kifbo6;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kifbo6/automatic_daily_backup_bot_working/;0;"Hi guys,
I‚Äôm experiencing an issue with whatsapp, the automatic backup (daily, weekly and monthly) is not working.
I have an iPhone 11 Pro with IOS 14.3 and i have this issue since i‚Äôve changed from android to IOS (8 months ago).
These are the tests i‚Äôve performed:
Erased all settings in the iPhone
Created brand new icloud account
Background app refresh is enabled.
Lowered rhe frequency of the backup.
Deleted icloud backup
I have 40 GB free on my icloud storage and chats are only 400 MB space.
The iPhone is always connected to the wifi.
Instead, the manual backup is working properly and if i keep opened whatsapp in the background, while my iPhone is charging and connected to the wifi, is working aswell, do you know why?
I‚Äôve tried to contact the whatsapp support 5 times but nobody is really helping me, they are always asking for information that i already provided over and over.
Thanks for help";2020-12-23 01:09:47;

"Whatsapp Web fails to sync and shows ""Phone not connected"" when app not actively open on iPhone";2;ki99wj;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ki99wj/whatsapp_web_fails_to_sync_and_shows_phone_not/;5;"After using Whatsapp (WA) alongside Whatsapp Web and Whatsapp Desktop for many years without any trouble, since a couple of weeks now, I have this new and persistent issue:

**Whatsapp Web and Desktop will only update/sync, e.g., effectively dispatch or receive new messages or otherwise interact with the associated phone, if the Whatsapp app is currently open and active on the phone. Not otherwise.**

This has become a major annoyance to me. My phone is an iPhone 6s Plus with the newest iOS 14.3. As computers, I tried on both a Windows 10 PC as well as a Macbook Pro running Mac OS Catalina.

What I have tried/can rule out:

\- it is not an issue of the phone not having Wifi. For example, the phone may be in use and I may browse in Safari (thus using Wifi), but still, no sync takes place with my Whatsapp Web/Desktop device unless I enter Whatsapp iOS app.

\- on the iPhone, Background app refresh is switched on for Whatsapp

\- From within Whatsapp iOS app, I have logged out of all Whatsapp Web connections and re-logged in.

\- The phone has rebooted many times.

\- iOS and Whatsapp iOS app itself are up to date.

Anyone having experience with this issue, that for me has arisen only recently?

Best,

Xerberus";2020-12-22 20:02:57;"My understanding is that Apple have been changing the way background notifications work in recent versions of iOS, which has made WhatsApp web more flaky for a lot of people using iPhones. Your issues sound like the worst I've heard of though -- for me notifications and syncing are delayed but eventually do seem to work.

Contacting the real WhatsApp support about the issue is not likely to help immediately but will give WhatsApp more signal that something isn't working right. Unfortunately, we may need to wait for the big multiple device update to solve the issue for good.

Edit: typo I have the same problem.  can't fix it by restarting or reloading app.   whatsapp now only works on laptop if my phone app is simultaneously open and active.   additionally, phone app won't  give me notifications of messages anymore.  I have to open it like email and wait for it to search for any new messages.  incredibly frustrating.  it started after I upgraded my phone ios.  still using mojave 10.14.16 on my laptop and very wary about upgrading.  everytime a new op system comes out all my programs and apps start acting kludgy.  expect much more from apple.  company made its name providing seamless utility for non-tech oriented users.  that's a pipedream now. Argh! I thought I was the only one. I've been googling this problem for two-three weeks now. I have the same exact problem to yours; I have to keep the app on my phone open and active, even if the screen goes to sleep, whatsapp desktop on my MacOS stops working. It's very frustrating because I hate having to use the phone to answer messages while I'm working. I really hope they will solve this problem somehow. Please update if you find a way around it. I too have tried every single suggestion out there, none worked. Indeed, in my case the issue does not occur just occasionally, it's systematic. I have already contacted Whatsapp Support and unfortunately they haven't gone beyond suggesting basic troubleshooting tips like restarting the phone, making sure cellular data is configured correctly etc.

It went back and forth twice by now. I don't know if by insisting I have a shot at reaching higher-level support. Very strange that I seem to be the only person suffering from this.

The background notifications in iOS in general still work since messages arrive on my phone when it is locked. I don't know if this extra information will help or not, but, it can't hurt.

Under the hood, WhatsApp uses ""video calling"" notifications to make WhatsApp Web work. ""What??"" You might ask. Yup, even when there's no video going on, WhatsApp (and many other apps) using video calling notifications because they give the phone more time to do things like encryption, connecting to the server, etc.

Apple is clamping down on apps using video calling notifications when they're not actually video calling, which makes things like WhatsApp web not work as well. 

This is now pure speculation, but It's possible that your iPhone is in a test either from Apple or from WhatsApp to see what happens when the video notifications don't work, and you're seeing the effects."
My dad started getting messages from random Indian numbers, then he got banned from whatsapp. What's going on here?;20;ki93fo;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ki93fo/my_dad_started_getting_messages_from_random/;7;;2020-12-22 19:54:19;"What were the messages? Appeal the ban to WhatsApp support.

When random messages come in, do not respond to them. Block them immediately.

Do not message people not already in your contact list.

Without more information we obviously cannot tell if this was a legit ban or not but WhatsApp support is usually pretty lenient to people who get banned for the first time. Happened to me also, but I emailed them regarding the ban and in no more than 5 days I got my account back. KEEP EMAILING THEM WITH DIFFERENT IDs I HOPE THEY WOULD RESPOND TO YOU PROMPTLY. ""Hi who is this"". He would block them and more came from different numbers. All Indian numbers. After blocking the 8th one, he got a pop-up saying ""your number is banned from using Whatsapp.""

Whatsapp is an essential part of our small business. I need this fixed or it could hurt me. It's not a business whatsapp account. Just his personal number. Perhaps someone that dislike him posted his number somewhere shady.. for now I'd try to get my hands on a new sim card and inform customers Try to email whatsapp support Isn't there any way to complaint to whatsapp authorities? That would help maybe"

I guess you already tried deleting the cache. Other things you could try is deleting whatsapp app data and unnistalling (if you really want to). 

If that doesn't work there's definetely a file and idk what to tell you, it must be somewhere, maybe inside the files of another app. It has to be somewhere, files in root folders should not appear on any app. Hidden files and folders are also not supposed to appear (but they are accessible without root). 

I would guess the file persists on being considered as new because of some metadata being weird and buggy. If it doesn't happen on other apps, whatsapp is probably just not doing a good job at reading that kind of metadata (which may not look like the common one) Yeah no matter what I do its still there...Even if I have a new pic or vids. It will still stay there..At this point..Idk what to do anymoreü§£ü§£ guess you are fucked until you find the file or delete all your files"

Why someone replied my receipts but ticks remain greyÔºü;26;khdeus;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/vd851eax5i661.jpg;13;;2020-12-21 11:40:58;I made some experiments with my friends and found out the only way to make it grey but replied is to set read receipts disabled... They could have used the quick reply option They probably disabled it they could have turned off their internet connection after the last message with two blue ticks then queued a reply and later connected to the internet which would sent the reply but if they didn't have whatsapp open then it wouldn't show the two messages in-between as read It means they responded without opening the app Because they have read receipts turned off. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre grey. They only turn blue if the receiving party enables read receipts. I disabled read notification and haven't enabled it in years. Some people used to hold the fact that I read and didn't reply against me. Not anymore! It's definitely this! How quick reply someone if you send them picsÔºü thank you is for the messages in between remaining grey and it's several hours after the blue tick one so it's maybe not about internet connection. Do you mean this person might reply me through Dropdown menu but didn't open our chat box then the ticks would be greyÔºü I tried with my friends, as long as you reply no matter reply it by notification or app, it'll show as read. Just like with normal messages that would probably also happen but idk if it turns the messages in the notification to read if you reply

The 15 WhatsApp tricks you should know;0;kgtzul;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kgtzul/the_15_whatsapp_tricks_you_should_know/;0;"

At this point in the movie, it is not surprising that **WhatsApp** is the most popular instant messaging application in the world, currently having more than 1,500 million users, 25 million of them in Spain alone.

It was born more than ten years ago, although it was not until 2010 that it began to resemble the application we know today. Since then, it has undergone several reconversions with each update, adding more and more features, some of which are not as visible or as well known. Therefore, below, we have collected 15 WhatsApp tricks that will probably make your life easier.

## NEVER DOUBLE CHECK BLUE

We are talking about the two blue angles that have been tormenting users of the messaging platform since 2014. Causes of arguments, misunderstandings and the occasional divorce, there is a way to end them. Silver bullets or stakes are not necessary, WhatsApp itself allows it, although the sneak is activated by default.

All you have to do is go to Settings (on Android it is accessed by pressing the three dots that appear in the upper right corner), select Account and press Privacy. Once inside this section, deactivating the Read confirmation box will be enough to end this 'bad'.

Although, it is not all good news. In groups they will appear, but in gray, also this deactivation does not affect the audios. People who send a WhatsApp audio to a user with this function deactivated will know that they heard it, both by the double check and by the point that marks the beginning of the audio, which will go from gray to 'telltale' blue.

## INDIGENOUS

In a world that increasingly dispenses with paper, things like keeping your shopping list by hand have been digitized. Yes, there are a thousand applications to create lists and notes, but there is nothing more comfortable than taking all those small notes of daily life in the application that, with total security, we use more times during the day.

We can use the chat of a person who blocked us as a notepad. Ex-boyfriend: -Buy lactose-free milk, jam, toilet paper. Buy a gift for granny's birthday. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't know how to take advantage of a breakup, that is.

If no one has ever blocked us (or you are an amazing person or a manual sociopath), we have a more ethical option, our own chat. How? Yes, a chat with our own number, something like the conversations between Gollum and Smeagol from 'The Lord of the Rings' but without unique rings in between.

Enjoying this function is as easy as adding your phone number as a contact, creating a new chat and searching for you on the WhatsApp list, a treasure trove of information.

## MIRON-PROOF AUDIOS

Despite being one of the simplest tricks, it is also one of the most unknown. How many times have you observed people approaching the speaker at the bottom of the mobile to their ear to listen to an audio. If we want to prevent half the city from listening to our conversations, it is enough to bring the mobile phone to the ear. As you hear it. As soon as the proximity sensor detects the proximity of the phone to the face, the audio starts to play automatically on the speaker for calls, so only you will hear it.

## BIG EMOTICONS

Emoticons were born to express complex feelings in a summarized way. Thanks to the imagination, which is one of the most important abilities of Homo sapiens, linked to creativity, the use of these characters has become a form of communication worldwide spread that, in addition, does not understand languages ‚Äã‚Äã(they could already have occurred during the construction of the Tower of Babel).

During the first years of the application, the emoticons were the same size as the plain text, something that has fortunately changed with the latest updates, allowing us to appreciate the details of the poop with eyes, the moon with the smile of Mona Lisa or the three monkeys from the Toshogu shrine (covering eyes, mouth and ears).

To see them with the maximum size they have to be sent one at a time, if we send two at a time they will look somewhat smaller, so on until sending four or more in a row, then they will have text size.

## FORMATS

There are people who stayed in times of the SMS language: 'tb' instead of also, '+' for more or 'tkm' for I love you very much. The escomia of language is no longer necessary to protect the pocketbook. On WhatsApp, unlike in the publishing world, you don't pay for words.

This paradigm brings us to the second type of people. Those that do not forgive a comma or a tilde (even the only one), that separate the information into paragraphs and do not send every three words. Those writers who would deserve the chair of the W (of WhatsApp) in the Royal Spanish Academy, who should be owners of an editorial group or the next Cervantes. For the latter, the application offers the possibility of making bold, italic, strikethrough and even monospaced.

If you want to write in italics, place an underscore before and after the text. (\_text\_).

If you want to make something bold, just put an asterisk before and after the text. (\*text\*).

To strike out the text, put a tilde before and after the text. (\~ text \~).

In the case of monospaced, three inverted quotes must be placed before and after the text. (\`\` \`text\`\`\`).

## THE ART OF ANSWERING WITH GIFS

Along with memes, interacting based on gifs (small animated clips, without sound and played in a loop) has become a new form of communication that is essential for new generations. Like many other functions, it appeared first on Telegram and later was added to WhatsApp. To start using it there are several ways.

First, sharing the gifs from the Gallery, which requires having previously downloaded it. You can also do a DIY ('Do it yourself', do it yourself in English) and make one from a video. At the time of sending it, in the application itself it will leave the option of 'Gif' as long as it is selected, dragging in the WhatsApp editor, a fragment of four seconds.

Another option would be through the Google keyboard, which has an integrated gifs search engine, or by pressing the emoji of the happy face, with which the menus of emoticons, gifs and stickers will be displayed (to send stickers).

## HIDDEN PROFILE PHOTO

One of the first steps after registering in the application is choosing a profile photo, the status and the name that will be shown to those who do not have our number on the agenda. If we use WhatsApp professionally, that is, for work, a profile photo of canes or a state that is a joke about the M√≥stoles empanadillas or a ""digamelon"" is not very serious.

This will no longer be a headache since it is also another of the application's customizations, which allows, through the Settings-Account-Privacy menu, to choose who sees this information, for everyone, for our contacts or hidden.

## WHO HAS READ WHAT

For the most 'stalkers' or gossips, there is the possibility of knowing who received the message that we send in a group and which people read it. You just have to press the message (be it text, video, audio or photo), select the three points and press 'Info'.

This information may be poisoned, if the chat is very crowded, it may be that the user has opened the chat, without specifically reading our message, but it would still be indicated as read.

## USE OF FAVORITES

Another of the less known, but more useful, functions of the application is the possibility of marking photos, videos, messages or any element that appears in a chat as a favorite. In this way, conversations can be somewhat more organized, being able to separate important elements from more banal messages such as ""I buy bread"" or ""it's raining in my neighborhood.""

To highlight an element of the conversation, it is only necessary to click on it, then several icons will appear at the top: an arrow to the left that serves to quote the text that is answered in the conversation, a star to mark as favorite, a garbage can that is effectively to delete the message, three connected nodes to share outside the application and a right arrow that serves to forward to another WhatsApp contact.

Indeed, the icon that matters to us now is the star. After pressing it, we will see how an animation of a star appears in the chat. It should be noted that this action is reversible and any element can be unchecked.

To consult the saved elements of a chat there are two ways. From the main menu, where all conversations are seen, if we press again on settings, we can access all the highlighted messages. Then, from each conversation, by pressing on the user's name, we will access the highlighted messages of that specific chat. In both cases, the items will be displayed in reverse chronological order to which we have marked them as favorites.

## CHANGE CAMERA

As in some social networks such as Instagram, if we are using the integrated camera function within WhatsApp, to change from the front camera to the rear camera or vice versa, simply press twice on the screen quickly.

There is a button for this function in the lower right corner, but if we use the mobile with one hand, this shortcut ends up being useful and indispensable.

## DELETE MESSAGES

After the update that added the ability to remove the blue double check, the delete messages feature is the next most popular. Attention because it can lead to confusion.

To delete a sent message, just press and mark the trash, then several possibilities will appear: Delete for me (we stop seeing the message but it does appear in the other person's conversation), cancel (to go back) and Delete to all, a function that marked a before and after in the use of the application, allowing you to delete that lag photo that you shared in a work group or that green joke that you forwarded to the ""Family"" group.

WhatsApp does not allow this second chance long for each message, so hurry to use it if you sent what it was not. Also, replacing the deleted, a ""message deleted"" notification will appear. The app is a tip but it's still better than nothing.

You can also delete the messages received, it can be in order to have your mobile checked, something that should not happen under any circumstances, due to the right to privacy. Be careful, if it is for a legal issue, even if the message is erased, the police can ask the companies for full conversations through the courts.

## SEARCH MESSAGES

They gave us the address of that restaurant awarded by the Metropolis Guide, but looking for it in a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãmemes and humorous comments is an Odyssey. WhatsApp has thought about this and has a solution, the option to search.

You can search within a specific chat, selecting the three adjustment points, marking the Search option and typing in a word that can accompany the desired message.

Another option is from the general menu, by clicking on the magnifying glass icon, yes, this search is general, although it indicates to which chat each search corresponds.

## SLIDE TO QUOTE

This function is very useful for answering specific questions. If we want to reply to a specific received message, just slide your finger to the right over the received (or sent) message, and the reply window will immediately appear just below it and attached to a box with the quoted text.

## SEND MESSAGES WITH THE ASSISTANT

It may happen that we are busy cooking or doing some botch at home, with the result of not being able to pick up the mobile with our hands to answer. Fortunately, assistants like Google allow you to answer and send messages through voice commands.

First of all, what we must do is activate the Google assistant with the voice command ""Ok, Google"". Then, we will indicate by voice command to whom we want to send the message (""send a WhatsApp to Mom""), always using the name by which we have the contact saved on the phone. Then, the assistant will open a dictation window to collect the words that we are dictating to it. Once we finish, we can confirm the shipment, re-dictate the message or cancel the entire operation.

## DARK WAY

One of the most demanded functions is already here, that of putting WhatsApp in dark mode, it uses less battery and our eyes will appreciate it. To replace the nuclear white in the background of the application, you just have to go to General Settings, Chats and in Theme, we can change from light to dark, very easy.";2020-12-20 16:29:08;

Hackers locked my dad out of WhatsApp;12;kgldd4;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kgldd4/hackers_locked_my_dad_out_of_whatsapp/;11;So about 5 hours ago someone (in a Spanish speaking locale) managed to transfer my dad's WhatsApp account to another phone. We're currently locked out of phone and SMS verification because this has been requested too many times - SMS verification is now saying to retry in 13 hours (up from 5 hours previously) and phone verification says to retry in -1 seconds. I know this is a bit of a long shot, but does anyone know whom I could contact to find out what is going on - there's a support email but I haven't heard back yet.;2020-12-20 05:05:10;"Same thing happened to my wife last year. There is an email contact you can email but to be honest they were completely useless. After each ""limit of SMS requests met, try again in X hours"" we just had to keep trying when the time lapsed until we eventually gained control again Support will come back in work days but Tweeting to @@whatsapp helped me in my case. If you have a support ticket id from their autoresponder then add it in tweet. As this is not a ban or block issue, support will sort it out. It will take time approx 4 to 10 days. Just wait for their mail and keep checking spam folder it might go there. Same shit happened to my WhatsApp account. Since then I literally never save no WhatsApp chats, nothing, I keep my WhatsApp clean at the end of the day. And yea, two steps Authenticator was not of a big help, unfortunately. Tell your dad to switch on Telegram app for more security. *whom* I could contact congrats

in whatsapp we do not know private message

all of your message

is our

&#x200B;

so everyone can access your txt LOL Thanks. Just to clarify, did they manage to gain control despite 2 factor authentication being enabled? I had 2 factor Authentication enabled. I was receiving non stop messages and phone calls, all in Spanish. I ignored everything and didn‚Äôt click no links. Later that night I had a notification, while trying to check my WhatsApp messages, saying: kinda sorry but your WhatsApp number is registered on the other device. I tried to send sms to verify my number but it didn‚Äôt work. I called and was able to verify my number at last. 

Same scenario happened one night later. 

I was totally confused weather I should continue using WhatsApp or not. 

But, because most of my contacts using WhatsApp, even though I recommended to switch and start using Telegram since it‚Äôs offering much better security. 

Anyways, I continue using WhatsApp but I made sure to switch off all chats back up etc. 

End of the day my WhatsApp is clean, zero savings. So, I am worries free. 

Many of my friends started to use Telegram right now because it is kinda worrying to keep private and or sensitive information on the chats when shit like that might happen. 2-factor can't do much if your device has been breached or someone cloned your SIM, though the latter is unlikely for a regular user. It's more likely that your dad clicked a bad link or got sent a file/GIF/video from a shady number. Some exploits on WhatsApp didn't even require the victim to open the received file, they just executed malicious code and that's it, the hackers have control. Just giving you a heads up that I finally tracked it down to the hacker taking control of my dad's voicemail account and then listening to the phone calls from WhatsApp that he didn't pick up. You may want to look into that as well as it's a broader security risk (especially for any other accounts you own that allow for verification via phone call)"

Why doesnt the database just overwite itself ?

nobody has any need for a dozen backup files !

&#x200B;

is there any way to switch this off or change it ?";2020-12-19 01:51:09;"Of course I have an answer because I googled it too. And yes, I am talking about local back ups. If you cannot find anything regarding this, I highly suggest you to reconsider your googling skills. Now, it is time to answer your questions which hadn't been answered because it has been answered thousand times before.

No, there is no way to turn it off. There are some apps that automatically delete those files and just keep the last one. No body needs these files? I believe that engineers at WhatsApp think this through more than you.

Why it does not just override to itself? Because they are back ups. Just a single copy is not a back up. It would be a copy! In order to make a back up, you should back somethings up. Just a single file can get corrupted or somehow get deleted. 7 of them makes the back up system much, much more redundant. Plus, it is more suitable for the consept of ""back up"". And, in case of a database failure, you can just revive one of your old backups. And just lose the time period between backups. A simple Google search would have answered all of your questions but instead, you are asking us? Google it sir, do not wait for us. u/JamesLemony

I am NOT talking about the backup frequency to Google Drive.

I am talking about the NIGHTLY BACKUPS to the phone which are stored in the phones WHatsApp DATABASE folder.Every night it adds a new file to the PHONE database.

Each file is between 30Mb to 40Mb.So, after 10 nights there are about TEN files there (totalling about 300Mb to 400Mb).

So, James, do you actually have an answer to this question?

I cant find anything online regarding this.

I can only find info relating to the Google Drive backup.

If you read (and understood) my questionand been helpful (rather than being rude in your reply), you would have seen I was talking about the PHONE DATABASE (and not google drive)."

(Question) Whatsapp Hackers.;1;kf4idr;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kf4idr/question_whatsapp_hackers/;0;"Hello. I am posting this on my mom's behalf. A lot of this happened in Spanish so I am generally translating what some of it. Yesterday someone hacked my grandmother's account and when my mom told the hacker ""I know you are not my mom"". The hacker then was spamming her through her actual number. When my mom told them she was calling the police, the hacker then kicked her out of her account and took over to run the same scam. He also texted my mom (through iMessage not Whatsapp) telling her ""this is what she gets for being a snitch."" My aunt told the family gc that the hacker was in there and she got kicked out of her account too. My mom immediately canceled her phone number. Afterward, my uncle called my mom's phone number and the hacker picked up and told him ""not to meddle Dr. (last name)"". The hacker then took over his Whatsapp and instagram too. He was trying to get money out of our contacts through Cashapp in my Grandmother's name but he was using the hacked accounts to say something like ""send x amount of money to (grandmother)"".

We already filed a report with the authorities but as expected they cannot do much. My mom contacted Whatsapp and they basically told her ""its impossible for someone to use your number, just log back in and the hacker will get kicked off."" My mom cannot log back in and the hacker has been going through her Whatsapp account using it for hours after the initial incident. 

My questions are: Has anyone experienced something similar? How could this have happened as while my grandmother did click a link my mother, uncle, and aunt did not they just pissed the guy off. And did anyone who experience something similar resolve it and if so how? Thank you in advance.";2020-12-17 22:38:35;

I found the Whatsapp folder where the various chat, media, etc are stored.

Can someone with my old account see my my old chats/photos on their phone?;2;keundl;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/keundl/can_someone_with_my_old_account_see_my_my_old/;3;"So I haven't had access to my old telephone number for a year or so but stupidly kept it linked to my WhatsApp. I woke up to a pop-up (one of those in-app popups, not like a text or anything) saying that the account was no longer registered with my phone:

""Your phone number is no longer registered on this phone. This is likely because you registered your phone number with WhatsApp on a different phone.""

This is believable, as my old number has probably been recycled by now, and someone else registered my old number on their new phone. I input my new number, got my 6 digit code (gave it to no one else), and seem to have created a new account. All my chats/contacts were seamlessly imported.

BUT I think someone is now on my old account. They were online even just a few minutes ago. Is it possible that they can see my old chats? I know that people may text them thinking it is me, but can they see old messages/photos that I sent? Or, because they're viewing it on a new device, can they not see any old photos/chats? And if they cannot see those chats, if one of my contacts texts them- thinking it's me- does that history come back and become visible for them again?

Rather nervous so any help is appreciated.";2020-12-17 12:56:22;"So you were still using your WhatsApp account even though you didn't have the number anymore right? Also do you backup your chats regularly to Google Drive or iCloud?

Let's call the person who has your old number M and your old number as *xxxxx xxxxx*. Theoretically, M downloaded WhatsApp on his/her own phone and used *xxxxx xxxxx* to get the verification code and logged into your account. Incase you backed up your chats, M would've got a restore backup prompt. **Good news is since M doesn't have access to your Google account or Apple account, M can't restore the backup from Google Drive or iCloud so it'll be blank. Bad news is M would still be in your groups, since it's your account and receive your messages.**

>""I input my new number, got my 6 digit code (gave it to no one else), and seem to have created a new account. All my chats/contacts were seamlessly imported.""

I'm assuming your old chats got imported because you had a local backup on your phone. Yeah, that's exactly the situation (stupidly using an account I no longer had the number for). And yes, I had local backups (I assume). Not to sound like a complete noob, but I don't think I've ever allowed for Google Drive or iCloud backups (at least I don't remember doing so, and I definitely don't do it regularly if so)- is that an opt in or opt out? I use an iPhone, if that matters.

Your comment has been extremely helpful, I spend the morning in a panic that someone was going to have access to every picture or message I've sent to someone for the last few years.

The messages/groups thing is frustrating, but I suppose I can deal with it. > I don't think I've ever allowed for Google Drive or iCloud backups

Oh okay. WhatsApp locally backs up your chats everyday at 2AM. 

You can turn on or turn off Google Drive/iCloud backup at any time and choose how and when it should backup.([https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/images/article/backup-whatsapp-icloud-1.jpg](https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/images/article/backup-whatsapp-icloud-1.jpg))

> The messages/groups thing is frustrating, but I suppose I can deal with it. 

I have an idea for this. **Please ask someone a second opinion on this if you will consider trying this. Idk much about iOS and there might be a much simpler method compared to mine.**

 It **theoretically works** for Android but I don't know how to implement it on iOS. There must be an iOS equivalent of this. 

1. After connecting your PC to your phone, copy the file named ""msgstore.db.crypt12"" from WhatsApp/Databases and all your media from WhatsApp/Media to your PC. 
2. Then on your phone uninstall the WhatsApp app. Then contact the person with your old number and explain the situation. 
3. Ask the person if he/she can allow you to gain access to your old WhatsApp account to fix things.
4.  **If the person M agrees, then do this:**
5. M should uninstall WhatsApp from his/her phone. Install WhatsApp on your phone, enter your old number *xxxxx xxxxx* to login and get the verification code from the person. 
6. Then go to **Settings >** **Account** \> **Change Number** \> **Next**. And enter your current phone number. Choose the option to notify your contacts about the change. Then your old account will be linked to your current number.
7. After that, ask M to login to WhatsApp with your old number on his/her phone. It should make a new account for him/her. Then you can thank the person and end your conversation with him/her.
8. If your old messages aren't there, uninstall WhatsApp from your phone, then copy the files you copied to your PC in Step 1 back to your phone. Then reinstall WhatsApp with your original account which is now linked to your current number."

There's no way to get that number back unless you work with the phone company, but I doubt they'll give you a number you haven't paid them for in a year. Is there any way if I unlock the phone and use the transfer my number feature to get my chats backs ? Only if you work with the new owner of the number, they give you the login code for the old number, and then you initiate the number change.

It sounds to be that you‚Äôre better off staying with Samsung than carrying two phones. Or on the other hand, it might be good to separate private life from work life.

Edit: I was wrong! The iPhone does support dual WhatsApp on the dual sim models, check the comment below Just went through this same experience. I must warn you that WhatsApp doesn‚Äôt transfer from android to iPhone. -_- I didn‚Äôt know this before switching. Had to buy a software to transfer from android to iOS. As a long time android user, android might‚Äôve been better to stick with. iPhone doesn't support dual sim, but you can install the WhatsApp for business app alongside the normal WhatsApp app, and register different numbers on each. This is what I do to keep work stuff and personal stuff separate and it works great.

The business app also has a few nice features like autoreply. Actually it does I have a 11pro max which supports dual sim. One physical one esim I had a personal WhatsApp app & a WhatsApp business on the same phone. Just wanted to clear that up what you stated was incorrect. Wait what, this doesn‚Äôt make any sense, since both android and iPhone users can use the WhatsApp computer app. 

I was pretty sure WhatsApp was just linked to the sim phone number, so if you keep the same number it‚Äôs the same WhatsApp account :) I delete my WhatsApp all the time. I don‚Äôt even back it up as I find it a waste. What‚Äôs that important that it needs transferring? I‚Äôm just curious and not being a douche üòÉ It does support dual sim a physical sim & a esim built directly into the phone. Thanks for correcting me! I did not know that and I should have done my research before posting, but it‚Äôs interesting nonetheless.

I‚Äôve placed an edit in the original comment as well. The problem comes when you want to transfer data like chats and images. On Android the data gets saved on Google drive, but on the iPhone it‚Äôs saved on iCloud. Those two are incompatible and you can‚Äôt transfer the data natively, you have to delete it, or do what the other person did and buy software.

WhatsApp, still have not fixed it! But hey, the now have shopping, a very useful feature /s Well... there are old messages from relatives who are no longer with us. Old photos, etc. Never heard of this before -- is there somewhere I can read more about this built in esim? I would have never thought of that. That is something you would always want to keep. Just look up esim supported devices any let iohone  from xs & beyond supports dual sim."

The max duration for a whatsapp video (at least on desktop) is 1 hour and 30 minutes or so;1;ke27rm;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ke27rm/the_max_duration_for_a_whatsapp_video_at_least_on/;1;"I can't find this online which is irritating for me. So I want to post it here

What you need to know: Yes I am aware that 65mb is the limit, but duration is also a limit. You can send long videos, but your contacts won't be able to watch them through whatsapp, they will have to find them on the gallery after downloading them.

If you want to know the details or the process of this, maybe you are doubtful or you think there is something that makes this inaccurate, please read [the comment I made below](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ke27rm/the_max_duration_for_a_whatsapp_video_at_least_on/gfzzwrf).";2020-12-16 07:24:42;"Here are the details of what led me to believe this.

# Task

I was asked to record someone's graduation (which was on zoom), and a family member wanted to access the recording. Problem is that he's not very good at devices, so whatsapp was the only option and it would take less time to do it this way than to teach him about devices (Taking in mind it's pretty hard to get ahold of him, and you can't point him to where he needs to click or tap in real time. A video tutorial was confusing for him)

# First conversion, reduce size

This is done on a desktop computer using the whatsapp desktop app (not the browser). The file was 400mb long and 10 hours long, mostly a static screen waiting for the meeting to start. So I trimmed the video and also compressed it using a program called Handbrake (with [this preset](https://pastebin.com/VJuk1aTg)). The end result was 116mb, 3 hours.

# Second conversion, split the files in 2 to reduce size

This is not good enough because the whatsapp size limit is 64mb. So I decided to split the files (using the produced video, instead of the source), not 50/50 because when I tried this, one file was too small and another one too large (I guess there was more movement towards the end). One video was almost two hours long, which gave me something a bit under 60mb, and another was a bit over an hour long which gave me something under 50mb. I tried to send them succesfully, but there was no preview, and when I pressed sent, you were only able to download it. It was here that I noticed that the videos were uploaded as documents.

# Third conversion, android compatibility

I tried to find info online, found people who suggested to use android presets, so I did it. The Android presets were very similar to my custom preset, the main differences are

* Interlacing was on default and on decomb, for me it was on off
* Web optimization and A/V alignment were off, mine was on
* The dimensions were different from the source files, they were lowered. (852x480 -> 720x473).

# Fourth conversion, encoded exactly the same, but only one fails

I ran it through handbrake with a higher crf than the android preset, and only one of them worked. The 1:50:00 video showed no preview, and I kept trying to find answers online about the duration, but everything I find kept saying ""65mb is the only limitation"". Two videos were encoded the exact same way, using the exact same preset and dimensions, and the file sizes were lower than 60mb, there is nothing different about them aside from the contents, the filenames, and the duration, I am not crazy- IT HAS TO BE THE DURATION.

# Last conversion, solved, split into 3

So, I split the files into three, each 1 hour. And there, it worked. All of them showed a preview and I sent it. I checked on my phone, and they were sent and could be seen as a video. They were not sent as a file that you were only able to download, and they didn't look like a document. And that is why I believe that 1 hour and 30 minutes is the duration limit (Or at least something in the range of 1:20-1:50)

\-

# Conclusion

Flaws there could had been?: These ""tests"" were only done on one device. I had also only tested on the whatsapp desktop app, Windows. No other operating systems were used, and this was not attempted on a mobile device. (I bet this also happens on mobile, at least the android compatibility thing, I had issues like this before on mobile but I didn't try to fix them like I did here)

Regarding privacy, laws, and alternatives: Another thing, I thought afterwards of uploading it to Youtube, but yeah it's better not to. Privacy concerns, and I also don't know the college nor the people involved, I may not be allowed, it's on a different country too (no idea why he transferred overseas). Even if it was unlisted, I know there must be ways to find unlisted videos. (This is also why I won't share the files, hopefully you can reproduce the issue on your machine)

Goal: If people try to find this with web search, they are going to get a result. Hey man, it works everytime, 100%, Reddit has never failed me.

Edit: Aftermath, my guy didn't watch the video. Why even ask me if you know it's gonna take me some time T\~T"

Is it possible to read a message without it showing as read?;2;kdvf5z;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kdvf5z/is_it_possible_to_read_a_message_without_it/;6;"I've got a friend who occasionally ""doesn't receive"" my messages and therefore doesn't reply.

The 2 ticks show, to say it's delivered but they don't turn blue to say it's been read. The next time I speak to them, (the next day for example) everything is normal but the message they said never came through is still not read.

This only ever happens with one person and I *would* put it down to occasional technical errors *except* last night the friend replied to the message that they hadn't seen. 

Basically, is there a way to read a message or dismiss it without showing it as being read? Am I being deliberately ignored..?";2020-12-16 00:52:42;"There are apps like Unseen that do this, on Android at least, by reading your notifications without having it ""read"" on the app itself. When you switch off Read Receipts in the WhatsApp settings, when you read a message it‚Äôs show as unread. But in return they cannot see if you have read their message. They are most likely ignoring your messages and or deleting to make it seem like they didn‚Äôt come through. There is a notification banner that pops up when a message is recieved. If it is short then one can read it there and it won't show up as seen. Even for old messages (those that are recieved when the phone was not actively being used)  it is possible expand them on the notifications drop-down and read them without it registering as seen. 

It could also be that they switched off the blue ticks feature like u/MrMQMan mentioned. Wouldn't this approach mark the message as 'seen' when replying to a later message down the line? I did wonder if they'd turned off the read receipt function but in my testing, when you turn it back on, the previous messages are marked as read as well.

Where as what I'm getting is only the ""undelivered"" message is not marked as read. I don't know how that is possible It‚Äôs likely that your friend has kept it on and from my tests the messages don‚Äôt show up as read after the feature turns off."

Question about merging backup files on Google drive;1;kctz4g;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kctz4g/question_about_merging_backup_files_on_google/;0;"Hi all :)

I have a question, I have a P20 Pro which I backup to Google drive every so often. However I also have some old backup files from another phone stored in this Google drive. 

Is it possible to merge all these into one file and use it on my current phone? I've seen a few things mentioned. Some mentioning you need some sort of key from the original  device to merge successfully, older backups into newer ones. 

Problem is I don't have my original device these backups are from and no key.

Any pointers? Is this possible? Do I need the original device?

Thanks for any help given. Much appreciated.";2020-12-14 11:43:56;

my friends and I noticed lately that WhatsApp is using our text and voice conversations for generating ads. For more context we use Facebook and YouTube on our phone together with WhatsApp. After texting or having a call through WhatsApp we see suggestions in Facebook regarding our last topic. YouTube lists videos regarding our last recommendations. This occurs very frequently lately. For example. A friend of mine just asked for a movie suggestion in a group chat. I replied with ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô and another friend got a video suggestion related to that movie right after that in YT. 
I didn‚Äôt find any checkbox in my WhatsApp settings regarding privacy and so on. I am using iOS. Thanks";2020-12-13 23:10:33;"WhatsApp is end to end encrypted as described in the white paper and cannot read your chats or listen to your calls. Countless security researchers have analyzed WhatsApp's white paper and verified that the app actually behaves as described. WhatsApp does not have access to your chats or calls.

Your allegations are also a bit silly... YouTube is owned by google and is a huge competitor to Facebook. These companies do not work together. How to prevent it? Use something else like Telegram or Signal. To counter: YouTube and Facebook sell data to each other."

Why do people no longer use Viber anymore?;3;kcb754;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kcb754/why_do_people_no_longer_use_viber_anymore/;4; Why it could not become as famous as whatsapp What is the reason behind the declining popularity of Viber?;2020-12-13 17:09:13;"Because people switched to other interesting and appealing platforms than Viber. In 2012, I had a Nokia (Symbian) with WhatsApp and Viber.
Symbian was losing to Android, and was clearly dead. Viber promised continuous updates and support yet (iirc) in 2014 they pulled off.

Meanwhile, WhatsApp gave updates until 2017. Yeah, three years later they were still providing support to that platform.

So why is WhatsApp more popular than, not just Viber, but every other app out there? Because they achieved what no other did: replace the SMS.

Opens fast, simple to use, the basic features everyone needs (whether they're advanced or not) do work (messaging, video/voice calls, profile pic) and it's compatible with the most devices. Viber has less features, has ads and works a bit slower as well. I always preferred WhatsApp and when I discovered Telegram I basically couldn't imagine using Viber anymore. I liked Viber, but only one person I know used it!"

If you're looking to change your number in whatsapp, you'll have to do that in the settings.
So changing your sim won't affect your WhatsApp account at all until you switch numbers in the app.

FYI: if you swap your numbet in whatsapp, your contacts will receive a notification that you changed your number, which will also show your new number. For a clean slate you should make a new WhatsApp with a new number. That way no one will be able to chat with you unless you start a new conversation.

FYI: If you want old chat back on your new number, you can log in with your current number on a different device. This will sign you out of your current device. Then you can log in with your new number and chose the restore chat option. Once it's done you will have all your old chats with your new WhatsApp number. People from you old chat won't be able to contact you. 
Your new number won't be able to chat in old groups. You will not lose your conversations but you will send your contact from the new number I think it‚Äôs going to ask you if you changed numbers and if you want to connect the account to the new number Also regardless nothing will be erased unless you reset the app."

Thank you so much. I had no idea. Will be switching all phone verifications to an app authenticator. Will that do the trick? Yep. 2fa should do the trick. Make sue to secure all your emails as well. Your old emails might be listed as recovery mails for your current primary ones so do update them as well."

Lost my account, can't request new code (Try again after -1 seconds), locked out forever?;1;kbklts;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kbklts/lost_my_account_cant_request_new_code_try_again/;0;"Hello everyone...

Just a couple of days ago I got my WhatsApp account hijacked and I haven't been able to get it back.

After waking up to many activation codes and missed calls from WhatsApp (Texas number), I was logged out of my account. I tried to log back in but I had to wait 5 hours for a new code. After waiting for 5 hours, I tried again, but I was too late and someone had tried to log in again, so this time I had to wait 12 hours.  


The following day I went to try again, but this time the countdown was stuck in ""-1 seconds"" and it has been like that for over two days now. I tried to uninstall the app and install again as many people suggested, I cleared cache, I changed the time in the phone, I restarted the phone a million times, waiting and not waiting in between... and nothing. I'm permanently stuck in here, without any chance of requesting a new code or do ANYTHING!

Has anyone else had the same issue? I found this video that seems to find a solution for the same issue, but also didn't work.

Please help! I really need WhatsApp for my business. My contacts are receiving strange messages asking to resend codes and it's creating a mess in my life in general.  


I understand as soon as I get it back (if that ever happens) I should activate 2 step verification and all kinds of security features I can, but how can I even try to log in?

She gets a notification of a new message and opens whatsapp and sure enough there would be an unread chat but when she clicks on that chat no messages show.

She would have to clear all recent apps multiple times or at times even restart her phone for the messages to show.

Now last week she changed her phone and the dammed problem is there on the new phone as well indicating that it was nothing to do with the phone she was using. She's on Android btw.

I have cleared the whatsapp cache and also reinstalled it but to no avail.

Please help.

Phishing: scammer logged out my wife's WhatsApp;2;kbhwn8;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kbhwn8/phishing_scammer_logged_out_my_wifes_whatsapp/;3;"My wife started receiving WhatsApp verification codes, and then a request from a South African number to give them the code. Naturally she didn't do this. Next thing we know, her WhatsApp account says that she has been logged out after activating her account on another device and that she needs to reverify if that's not right, yet the SMS and calls for verification codes kept coming.

I'm assuming they had somehow logged her out without successfully logging in at the other end (since they didn't have the codes), but I don't know how this would even work. We've reverified on her device and she's back in, but it's very concerning that this is even possible.

Has anyone experienced this before?

Edit: We're also installing an anti-virus on her phone to scan for viruses in case there's something that can intercept the messages.

Edit 2: The correspondance:  https://imgur.com/jXHk1Vf  - The message is fairly normal for the type of scam, her being logged out of her account isn't.";2020-12-12 06:33:53;[deleted] Yes that's exactly what happened. I wasn't aware that WhatsApp had 2fa. I'll get her to do that, thanks. It gets weirder. She enabled 2fa yesterday and this morning she found that she had to reverify her phone number to continue using it again. This time she also had to put in the PIN number, but she hadn't received any verification codes initiated by someone else. I'm beginning to lose faith in their security. [deleted] The problem with that is getting everyone else onto those. WhatsApp is even an official way to contact shops in Hong Kong, so it's what my wife and all of her friends use. I don't think there's much chance of switching. If there was I would have already to be honest. Thank you anyway though, the info is appreciated.

I sent a picture in a group chat, and pretty much 3 minutes later, regretted it and deleted it for everyone. 
My question is: after I deleted it, is the picture deleted from everyone else's gallery, or just WhatsApp? 
I'm asking this because I've searched online, and I come across posts that say the pictures are deleted from the receiver's gallery, and posts saying the picture isn't deleted from their gallery, only the WhatsApp. 

Some of the receivers told me the picture had been deleted from their gallery, but others showed me their phone, and the picture was still there, so I'm really confused? as to what happens, since I want the picture gone. 

Thank you for the help!";2020-12-10 15:23:13;"It depends on whether the photo got downloaded or not. In whatsapp there is a setting to auto-download media on wifi or cellular or both. 

If the photo gets downloaded automatically or the person manually downloads it (which means it will also get saved in their gallery) and then you delete it, 
1) For iPhones - the photo will get deleted in Whatsapp but stay in their gallery. 
2) For android - the photo will get deleted in their gallery also

But if the photo is not downloaded automatically or manually (which means the photo is not in their gallery yet) , it gets removed from their Whatsapp and there is no trace of it in their phone. This is not true. Whatsapp links its media to files in storage. If something gets deleted for everyone, Whatsapp will absolutely also delete the file if it can. Just tested on my 2 iphones and no, the photo is still in the gallery of the 2nd iphone after I deleted for everyone in my 1st iphone. It just disappears only in whatsapp.
Will also test on android and update. Must be an iOS access restriction then. On Android it's definitely deleted. Tested on android and u are right, photo gets deleted on android :)"

I spent some time investigating this today and I have [an answer that explains what's going on](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kuiuc1/the\_youtube\_link\_share\_problem/).

**TL;DR: YouTube is producing invalid HTML with `<meta>` tags in the `<body>` instead of the `<head>`, and this is causing the WhatsApp link previews to not work properly for YouTube links.** Google did something at their end..

If you share a link on WhatsApp, it opens that link and gets the metadata of page and it displays preview. So, my assumption is Google did something at their end which is rejecting whatsapp request for page ( maybe Google thinking it is a bot request and rejecting it) probably the headers Whatsapp app uses are blocked by google

Its working in web whatsapp and no issue there Not working for me either Not working for me for days. Both iOS app and macos Firefox/Chrome. It's pissing me A LOT. Android user here and I can report it's also not working. My gf reports the same on her iphone. That's weird. Why would it happen in the first place, do you have any idea? If that's the case they should ban the in app player, but still allow the preview to be displayed Atleast links should display title of the video, a plain link looks spam-ish to me. so is it Youtube or Whatsap engineers that are a bunch of dicks? 

Youtube link preview work on Telegram, but not Whatsap >Its working in web whatsapp and no issue there

its not working in both for me Its not working for neither for me. This has happened before (like, years ago). They eventually fix it but its still annoying to deal with. Most likely broken by WhatsApp update"
Whatsapp Account Hacked - Can‚Äôt Log Back In;3;ka9ml2;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ka9ml2/whatsapp_account_hacked_cant_log_back_in/;6;"Hi everyone. I‚Äôve become a victim of ‚Äòsocial hacking‚Äô - where someone on your contact list sends you a Whatsapp message asking you to verify a 6-digit OTP and you receive an SMS with that 6-digit OTP. Unfortunately I‚Äôve fallen victim to one after just clicking the link in that SMS.

Now I‚Äôm unable to access my Whatsapp account. My friends have been messaging me on other messaging apps asking me if my account has been hacked. I‚Äôve already uninstalled and reinstalled Whatsapp, but I have to wait 12 hours to be able to send a request for a new verification code and 6-digit OTP. I‚Äôve also emailed Whatsapp Support but have yet to receive a reply. This is freaking me out, knowing that I can‚Äôt do anything for 12 hours while the fraudster‚Äôs doing who knows what on my account.

I‚Äôve seen websites on this but they‚Äôve never mentioned the 12-hour waiting time that I‚Äôm experiencing. What‚Äôs gone wrong? Have I taken the right steps so far? Thanks.";2020-12-10 08:43:34;"Call/email WhatsApp. Waiting for 12 hrs doesn‚Äôt work as hacker needs to enter wrong info and you will be out for another 12 hrs. If your whatsapp account has been banned , either for a period of 12 hours or 24 hours ..

from here via video

https://youtu.be/yim2PGVmxWI Try setting your phone clock 12 hrs ahead Already tried emailing but Whatsapp support has been unresponsive lol. It‚Äôs fine though I managed to log back in after 12 hours, guess the hackers might‚Äôve moved on Or you can follow the explained steps via this article

WhatsApp took unexpectedly amount of resources;5;ka6f1j;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ka6f1j/whatsapp_took_unexpectedly_amount_of_resources/;2;"I've used WhatsApp on PC client for well over 2 years now. I don't know where to say this but, I think I can count this as an feedback. I have 2 different PC running WhatsApp periodically (office use, and personal use).1st PC (my own), had R5 2600, GTX 1660 Ti, 16GB Ram - Can run WhatsApp pretty well.2nd PC (office use), had i3-9100, GTX 1650, 8GB Ram - Had trouble running it.

It can pin the cpu to the absolute limit if I tries to switch from chats to chats if there are upcoming picture needed to load.

I don't know what causes such basic tasks can cause full-usage of the CPU. This only applies to PC client. Browser client is another story, it can run ([WhatsApp](https://web.whatsapp.com)) seamlessly. No matter how much or how fast I switches between chats, the CPU just won't pin nor spikes.

My question is if I can still access my login history, as I didn't get a good look at it and it didn't occur to me in the moment to take a screenshot. However, I think the notification said that the login happened on December 10th and today is December 9th (lol). But I'm not sure about this, since it all happened very fast.

Since there is a good chance that WhatsApp will be split off from big daddy Facebook if the US courts get their way.

Hopefully the company that will end up with the ownership of WhatsApp will do a better job. But it does mean that until things are settled it's unlikely we will see FB do any major investments/changes to the application as it would be a waste of their money.

In case you don't have google drive backup you can try and restore local backup (don't delete the msgstore file if you don't have google drive backup). Force stop the app. The backup data with something like titanium backup. Should I delete the google drive thingy cause I dont have back up?
Also should I wait for all this to be deleted or I can start to local backup now?? Unfortunately this isn't really useful advice if you aren't rooted. I'm a root user myself and won't use an Android phone without root, but most people are not like that. üòâ You should uninstall WhatsApp before 2 am local time. That's when the app updates backup (in your case it will delete all your messages from local backup). 

When you reinstall whatapp again it will give you an option to restore from local backup. 

I apologise if it's confusing but the way WhatsApp works is that even if you delete all your messages it will only update the local backup (msgstore.db.crypt12 file in whatapp folder) at 2 am. You can copy that file to somewhere else and you won't lose your messages. Thanks for helping, I tried this but it didnt really work"

"Locked in WhatsApp Business API. Need help to ""reclaim"" our number";2;k8tu4d;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/k8tu4d/locked_in_whatsapp_business_api_need_help_to/;4;"Hi Reddit, first post here. 

We have a WhatsApp Business App account where we recently moved to one of the designated ""solutions partner"" so that we can utilise CS platforms to handle our increasing number of CS requests.

The problem is, the solutions provider is providing a sub-par experience for us when compared to the native WhatsApp business client on an app.

We found this out only of course, migrating our number over and set it all up.

Now our CS staff are in an uproar and we are desperately trying to go back to using just the Business App to handle our services. 

So I emailed said solutions partner and they just informed me that there is no way to for the number to be removed from their system or use with WhatsApp

Here is our problem. We have published this number on our media since we started business. So we cannot simply just get another number. 

So my question to you all is? Can a Facebook/WhatsApp partner screw you over like this by taking what is essentially our rights to our number over permanently?

Can someone tell me if there are any recourse or solutions to our situation? We can't even contact Facebook for support as the number is no longer listed in our business manager settings";2020-12-08 03:53:57;"contact whatsapp and they will get it back for you ONLY IF YOU OWN THE NUMBER (if you got it from some shady site it wont work) WhatsApp Business API is far more superior and then the app. You can do lots of things which app can't. The reason why you care locked in is because your solution partner don't have much to offer or they are unware about latest changes in whatsapp api.

I have been helping business coming on to whatsapp business API platform since a year now and some of them have daily unique interaction of around 9K new people and it seems to be working very smoothly.

I am tech consultant myself. If you can share your tech specs then I can advice more in details. Thanks for the reply. It is an actual mobile contract number so yes. Do you know where we can reach out to WhatsApp support team from? We have looked around and have not seen any directions to get support Hi thanks for the reply. We are only a small startup and our CS staff are mainly agitated by the lack of features and subpar experience to handling CS messages, for example we are not able to see which messages are waiting for customer replies, which we need to reply, and we can't even have closed ""tickets"" from the same customer and have them reopen a new ticket the next time the same person contacts us.

And even basic things like setting autoresponder for after office hours is not possible with our current partner.

Or simply the playback of customer sent recordings in whatsapp' ogg format on an iPhone client

Of course, we know the Business API is the future to go to scale.

But at our current scale, because we have faced these issues with our current provider and they themselves take a few days to answer your queries or in some situations simply ignores you.

We just want to go back to the way it was before we evaluate another partner provider.

But by all means if there are solutions providers that can provide these services, please let us know.

Thank you!"

Short Answer: Backup messages right before switching phones. Restore backup right after switching phones.

*Detailed Answer: To ensure you don't lose any messages, first click on Backup Now on your iPhone 11 and do the iCloud backup. After that login to WhatsApp account AAA on your iPhone 7 (when you do this you will be logged out of your iPhone 11) and restore the backup. Go out, use your iPhone 7 and then when you reach back home click on Backup now on your iPhone 7. Then log in to your WhastApp account AAA on your iPhone 11 and restore the backup.*"

Trying to reduce WhatsApp size, deleted a ton of media but can‚Äôt seem to figure out what the yellow bar is or how to reduce it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Even I want to know about it. Were you able to figure it out? That makes A LOT of sense in hindsight ü§£

Thanks üëçüèªüëçüèª It's a little confusing, Whatsapp should definitely clear this up a little.

""Used"" only measures the ""Whatsapp Media"" in **Blue**.

They don't provide a size for the **Yellow**, that's everything else on your phones memory.

They do provide your phone's ""Free"" memory. 14 GB in this case.

You can double check this by going into settings and looking up your used and free memory. But you can also calculate the Yellow from just the above information.

Yellow = Phone's memory size - Blue - Free. Assuming 64GB memory:

Yellow = 64 - 5 - 14 = 45 GB. Np! Thanks for explanation, and yes, WhatsApp should clarify this, its really confusing!!"

I‚Äôm sorry if that title is a bit hard to understand, as I didn‚Äôt exactly word it properly, so I‚Äôll explain it here. For quite a while now, whenever I open WhatsApp, at the top of the screen, usually where it shows the contact‚Äôs name, it shows: connecting... I‚Äôm not exactly sure why it does that, as my WiFi is always working and runs quite fast. This is a very irritating problem and I wonder if anyone could tell me how to fix it.

the disclaimer on whatsapp when u open a chat talks about how its end-to-end encrypted and no one outside the chat, not even whatsapp, can see the contents. I find this funny because literally all u have to do is screenshot/screen record and anyone can see the conversation lol. how many screenshots of whatsapp convos do we see posted on social media. seems like the disclaimer does fuck all.

&#x200B;

 but i digress. my main point is, is it really as simple as deleting/clearing chats for them to be gone forever? part of me feels like if the feds/government really wanted to see a whatsapps chat contents they could...somehow...";2020-12-06 01:13:49;"No they are not gone forever. The encryption refers to the messages as they are sent and stored. People taking screenshots is separate to that There's one more place they might be stored: backups in iCloud and google drive Once you've cleared the chats and both phones have done their next backups (or if backups are disabled), then the chats do not exist anywhere (except perhaps screenshots as you mentioned, but screenshots can be faked).

I will also point out that end-to-end encryption is just that and only that. It means WhatsApp, and governments, and hackers, can't access your messages -- it is technically impossible without compromising the entire phone. This raises the difficulty of spying on you by orders of magnitude. Systems like what Snowden exposed at the NSA cannot access WhatsApp messages like they can text messages, emails, etc. Care to expand True. But are they stored/accessible by someone somewhere even if both chats are cleared and deleted from receiver and recipient"

If yes, then you can clear all WhatsApp data and reinstall it again, revalidate your phone number and, in the end of the re-validation, choose to restore the backup. Nothing.

Can WhatsApp read end-to-end encrypted messages?;6;k5zjol;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/k5zjol/can_whatsapp_read_endtoend_encrypted_messages/;16;"WhatsApp has content moderators that can see messages sent on the platform. To me, this means that messages aren't encrypted end-to-end in a proper way and WhatsApp can actually see the messages whenever they want.

I wanted to ask about this as I am curious. Are messages actually encrypted end to end with no one but the sender and recipient able to read them?

The 2 conflicting sources I found on this are as follows:

Website claiming WhatsApp is truly encrypted: https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/what-is-whatsapp/

Website claiming it's not: https://www.slashgear.com/you-should-stop-using-whatsapp-right-now-02586098/";2020-12-03 18:42:36;"The whole point of encryption is so no one can see it except YOU, your phone has the key to read and send the messages, if you don't have it, you can't see them. Which also means WhatsApp CANNOT see them.

Reports with screenshot evidence can of course be seen Nobody here can give you a definite answer unless they work at WhatsApp and are willing to tell the truth. WhatsApp *claims* to have E2E and the last time this was 100% undeniably true was the year it was implemented. Because at that point their words were confirmed by someone people actually trust - the guy who created that encryption method.

After that, nobody audited it, nobody checked its integrity and nobody knows whether the encryption is still there and intact. For all we know, it's all been gone for a while.

Alternatively, yay, the encryption is still there. However, it's possible that they still have the decryption keys as we have no idea what the server-side code is like.

Basically, your security using this app depends on Facebook. So the question is... do you trust Facebook? What about group messages? It is end to end encrypted and no one can see your messages even whatsapp Is it open source? Easy to publicly verify their claims End to end encryption but it would be hard to say whether WhatsApp themselves can read it or not. That would be very hard to be sure of Ok, here's a proper answer for you: the latter website looks correct.

Despite the content of the articles here's what I understand: WhatsApp does use E2E encryption HOWEVER the ""meta data"" is available. 

This is critical!!!

Example: Whatsapp knows that the number you messaged last night belongs to hospital that specializes in cancer treatments... whatsapp doesnt know what you wrote though... they also know you messaged 10 minutes at 09:33 later to a lung specialist doctor, but they dont know what you spoke about... because ""end to end encryption"" ‚Ä¶ they know that the next day in the afternoon you messaged a health insurance company, but they still dont ""know"" what you wrote because it's ""encrypted"" but they have a pretty good idea now what's up.

&#x200B;

Meta data is all this associated data with numbers and messages and basically a very clear picture can be built. Oh hey you messaged a known cocaine drug dealer? they have nooo idea what you spoke about... nope, none, none what so ever /s  


So what to do about this? Use ""Signal"".

Its basically a ""blue whatsapp"" it was designed by the same guy who originally made whatsapp. It's all encrypted, no meta data.

Stop using whatsapp! (I am here curtesy of r/random ) Encryption can also be used to make sure no one but the sender, receiver, and WhatsApp can see the messages.

I know that's not the point of e2e encryption, but if they see messages for moderating, then... They're lying.

It's FB at the end of the day, so definitely possible. I just wanted to see if anyone knows for sure what they do. It's actually verifiable by decompiling the apps and comparing the implementation to the white paper:  https://www.whatsapp.com/security/WhatsApp-Security-Whitepaper.pdf

WhatsApp is used by over 2B people and lots of security researchers check that this is how it actually works. If it didn't work as described, it would be a huge news story. But it does work as described, and there's no broad conspiracy.

You'll note that because of the way it works, there is no way for WhatsApp to collect the encryption key. Yes, in theory an app update could change the code to leak the encryption key, but again, a security researcher would discover that and it would be a big news story.

As other commenters mentioned, there are other ways for WhatsApp to look at a small subset of reported messages: via screen shots or the ""report conversation"" feature (in which one side of the encrypted conversation sends a small number of messages as part of the report unencrypted to WhatsApp). This is the primary tool WhatsApp uses to fight spam, by the way.

The truth is, despite being owned by Facebook, WhatsApp is the worlds largest truly end to end encrypted communication platform. Group messages are also end to end encrypted, but it works a little different to 1:1 messages, as described in the white paper: https://www.whatsapp.com/security/WhatsApp-Security-Whitepaper.pdf

Instead of sending unsigned messages, group messages are signed by the sender and use an encryption key shared by the group. The encryption keys are regenerated by each client every time the group membership changes, so old members can't decrypt messages once they've been removed from a group, even if there was a glitch and their client revived the encrypted bytes. No. So we have to trust Mark Z There's your answer. Stay away from WhatsApp if you value your privacy. Telegram the best piece of software ever made (the source code is a mess thoüòú) Nope, sorry. Don't agree there. Telegram is probably the best app in terms of usability. But not much better in terms of security/privacy. Privacy it has (simple things as not sharing phone number, so on). Security can be discussed, but in seven 7 years not serious scandals about security and data leaks as in others supposed to be more secure...

And as others say, I don‚Äôt care what they do with my data if I feel pleased with the service (GoogleüòÖ) If they collect your data then that's not private at all."

Someone actually hacked my WhatsApp account...;26;k5s2s9;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/bdmb4m8m2x261.jpg;16;[deleted];2020-12-03 09:32:37;"Weird thing happened to me last night... someone actually hacked my WhatsApp business account. I was receiving non stop messages and phone calls for about 10 min (in Spanish language, not sure as of why) from ‚ÄúWhatsApp‚Äù to get a verification code, which I completely ignored. I went off doing some stuff. Few hours later all I saw was what you can see on the picture. Surely, I was stressed out because we all have pretty much important information in our chats. I was not able to verify my code cause it said that‚Äôs my number is registered on another phone. However, I was able to get a phone call to verify my code. I completely deleted my WhatsApp account. Reinstalled the app. Set a new WhatsApp account under the same number. Done all and chose not to storage chats (off). To mention that I had my phone and my sim number on me and I had a two steps verification on previously set.

Speaking generally, shit like that never ever happened on my experience. It is just confirmed to me that I would better go for Telegram app instead. First I'm hearing of someone bypassing authentication. Wow, how can it that be.... first time to see this I feel sorry for you, I have authentication enabled so I god forbid hope this doesn't happen to me.

Tell EVERYONE YOU KNOW (even colleagues) that your WhatsApp is compromised and to ignore any incoming messages.

P.S I have a tip for phone number security, enable SIM CARD Lock, this'll prevent the Sim Card from even connecting to the network and you most enter its PIN. 3 failed attempts will make you enter the PUK code (Pin Unlock Key) which you must get from your provider.

10 failed attempts of the PUK code will permanently block the Sim Card and you most get another one. LAST night THE same shit happened again! I have no fucking idea how is this possible?!?!?!?! How someone can hack my WhatsApp account on the other side of the planet ??? try getting WhatsApp Support to help you, they should be able to help. tell them the issue, and they should be able to get your account back How do they bypass two step verification I have really no idea ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I tried to google it, there are some possibilities but really I don‚Äôt know.. Thanks. How to do a lock on a sim card ? Thanks Thank you for the advice üëç I mean ever since I switched to iPhone I‚Äôve always been doing this, first time I turned off my phone a few years ago I didn‚Äôt know what I was supposed to do and ended up blocking my sim hahhah
Not sure if it‚Äôs just with my sim or my device No fucking idea.... I answered a call firstly and the lady  bot ü§ñ speaking Spanish. I hanged off immediately. Via messages I didn‚Äôt click no links, nothing. Sim cloning is a possibility. The calls might have been them confirming who the phone number belongs to, for example. Look in your phone's security settings and you should see aim lock. Faaarr out just crazy Absolutely crazy and had to warn all my contacts to mind what they text to me"

cheers";2020-12-03 02:12:59;"Yes, if the number is linked to the whatsapp account they could potentially set up the whatsapp on a different phone. (Since they are able to get the verification code).

The way to stop this would be enable to Two Step Authentication under Settings > Account.  This would be a code you set up which they will have to use if they set up the whatsapp account on a different phone.

Make sure to set up an e-mail adres as well which will be used to recover the password in case you forget the PIN. SIM card is one of your identity. If you lend your identity to someone else, you're stupid. While there's a way to prevent WhatsApp hacking, like enable 2FA, it's not a 100% way. They could abuse your number for many things. mine backs up to g drive once a week anyway Also, make sure to backup your whatsapp as well to safeguard your chats etc. But the only thing with 2fa is if the friend tries to set up the account on his phone, they both will be logged out. If you lose your phone, someone can take your SIM out pretty easily and just use it, unless you have a PIN code, which is not enabled by default for many carriers. Even then, you're not safe by any means, getting a new SIM by identity theft used to be trivially easy. Depending on SIM card for any kind of verification is insecure and should not be used at all.

EDIT: Any vendor that solely uses phone number/SIM for identity verification is a luddite and should not be relied on in terms of keeping your data safe. Thats why I urged him to back up his whatsapp."

If you're on an Android phone, the power management can interfere with tasks like this. First, log out of all web.whatsapp sessions. Uninstall, reinstall WhatsApp through OTP. Even I didn't do anything wrong and in 5 days registration without contacting any stranger how it's can happen will you tell me Yeah exactly nothing to worry about I've changed my phone 2 to 3 times in hope of such case but unfortunately that wasn't the case. It happened in every single time or any given phone and nothing i could do to make sense out of it. Even I got banned on 1 registration after receiving OTP as I'm new user I don't know why More than 5 people have reported your number.

If someone knows how it would be appreciated:D;2020-12-02 21:42:54;"Yes, using 3rd party programs where you export you chat to them and they show you a bunch of stats about the chat You can use dr fone to export your chat to pc. There is no need to pay for the software because you don't need to restore your chat later. Once the chat is exported, search for msgstore.db in explorer. Open it using WhatsApp viewer (it's free software that you can find from a google search). Located the desired chat and export it in JSON or txt format. 

You can count your total messages from there (for example you can open the JSON file in notepad and count the number of times 'fromMe' appears. That's your total message count. 

It's a bit tedious process but you only need to do it once. After that, you can directly export chat from WhatsApp after a month or two (depending on how active the group is). You can manually combine all the chats in one file. I wrote a little python code to combine chats automatically that I'll be happy to share. 

Message count should be a feature in WhatsApp and I don't understand why full export isn't an option on android. They say it's because of constraints on email size but it's been about 3 years since they have other export options.

PS: You can use GBwhastapp to export the chat too if you don't wanna use dr fone. But I have heard some users getting temporarily banned from using moded WhatsApp.

If your device is rooted then you don't need to use dr fone or GBWhatsApp, you can get the msgstore.db file directly from data/data/com folder.

Be sure to backup chats on google drive first. 

Hope this helps. :) Just download a program called Backuptrans on your computer, connect your phone to pc then the software will display all messages from your phone.

Hi everyone,

Where do the recommendations in the notification come from?  
Can anyone tell me how the recommendations work?

&#x200B;

Is it from a WhatsApp cloud AI, where my messages are sent to, to analyze what someone would answer? (Which would be funny, 'cause well.. there goes the end-to-end encryption.

I've never written a text like this (never mind the language).

That's why I don't think it's from my android keyboard which would statistically give recommendations based on my history.

Best

To your specific ask about where the suggestions come from:

> The important thing to remember here is that the machine learning is done on the device, so your privacy is secure. That's another big topic for Android 10 this year, privacy. So it's good to see that this machine learning data is not going up to the cloud and hitting Google's servers."

Is there any way to backup messages without freeing space on ios;7;k56bff;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/k56bff/is_there_any_way_to_backup_messages_without/;1;Got the 12 after a good 5 years of a 16gb iPhone 6. Majority of the space(around 9gb)is being taken up by WhatsApp media and I wish to save them all. To back up my WhatsApp the phone says to clear up at least 6gb of space, which means in order to save the thing I want I literally need to delete that very thing. Is there any way around this where I don't need to free up space? Thanks much.;2020-12-02 12:39:23;"Hey man, 

Its a simple process

1. Back up your iPhone 6 to the computer.
2. Restore the backup to the iPhone 12.
3. Insert the sim card from iPhone 6 to iPhone 12 and start WhatsApp. 

All your data will be there, all 9gb of it. 

Let me know how it goes."
YouTube Link Preview not working?;26;k55sop;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/k55sop/youtube_link_preview_not_working/;18;I use WhatsApp on android. For the past few days if I share a YouTube link on WhatsApp, the link preview doesn't pop up at all. Is this a WhatsApp bug? My internet speed is great and I've checked for other settings which are all okay.;2020-12-02 11:53:39;"Having the same issue here (Android also). Just started a few days ago. This guy solved it by adding a missing letter to the link, that worked for me at least, its not very practical but for the timebeing i think nothing else would work..
https://youtu.be/8O5pTWbpB50 I have same issue Same problem here in iOS. For some reason it works if i use mobile data. On wifi it do not load the link preview. Been days and still not fixed It might be that Youtube has pulled the plug and no longer wants to allow users to preview videos on Whatsapp as we are not using the YT website? If this is the case blame on them I still have this problem despite updating the app. Has anyone found the fix to this? I spent some time investigating this today and I have [an answer that explains what's going on](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/kuiuc1/the\_youtube\_link\_share\_problem/).

**TL;DR: YouTube is producing invalid HTML with `<meta>` tags in the `<body>` instead of the `<head>`, and this is causing the WhatsApp link previews to not work properly for YouTube links.** I tried this but no luck This is the only solution I found that worked for me. Thank you.  That helped. So here's the work around,  for now at least.

1. Switch to mobile data only

2. Add timestamp at the end ?t
     So whatever your link, add ?t at the end

3. If that doesn't work, try same link without the secure s:   http:// only

Hope this helps days? maybe you mean years or decades that's what i suspect Same on iOS No luck with me either. 

EDIT:   
Ok so apparently it's a problem with the most recent version of Whatsapp in the app store.   
So I uninstalled Whatsapp (backed up first), and then downloaded a beta version from apk mirror: [https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/whatsapp-inc/whatsapp/whatsapp-2-20-206-18-release/](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/whatsapp-inc/whatsapp/whatsapp-2-20-206-18-release/) 

That worked Still doesn‚Äôt work for me on iOS, after updating WhatsApp.


What does work is pasting a link, and change it from youtu.be to ‚Äúyoutube.com/embed/ the rest of the link‚Äù I'm hoping they know this and solve it in the next update lmao That worked! Thanks!"
Going crazy trying to figure out how to restore my backup on my new phone.;6;k5553o;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/k5553o/going_crazy_trying_to_figure_out_how_to_restore/;7;"Please help...I'm at wit's end. The sequence of events is:

1. 1.5 weeks ago my Pixel 4 XL has a battery issue. I back up my system, and I also had nightly backups to drive on for whatsapp.
2. I leave the phone at a repair shop and put my sim card in a Pixel 5, to test it out. Whatsapp restored normally during phone setup, no issues.
3. Google has to ship me a new Pixel 4 XL because mine is unfixable.
4. I transfer everything from the Pixel 5 to the new Pixel 4 XL.
5. I open whatsapp on the new Pixel 4 XL, and notice nothing has restored and I wasn't prompted to restore.
6. I go back to the Pixel 5, run another backup (which appears to run and complete successfully), try again on the Pixel 4--no dice.
7. I go check the backup on google drive and see this:
https://i.imgur.com/HyMulgA.jpg
8. I try a few solutions I find online--resetting all permissions and then trying to backup and granting permission when requested, giving whatsapp on both phones the max possible permissions for everything, removing lock screens so there's no phone security, uninstall/reinstall, etc. No dice.
9. I take the local backup files from the Pixel 5, copy them to the appropriate locations for the Pixel 4 XL, and follow the instructions from whatsapp to restore from a local file, which say to uninstall and reinstall and I will be prompted to restore:
https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/chats/how-to-restore-your-chat-history/?lang=en
10. I am not prompted to restore when I do this. My old chats still are not there.

Is there anything I can do? I've found posts on here and on the google support forms with similar issues, but not all of these together at once, and as far as I could see they were pretty much all unresolved anyway. Is there any third party app out there that can do whatsapp backup and restore?

Thank you...";2020-12-02 10:58:15;"This is a very strange issue that should not happen at all.  Are you logged into your google account on the new Pixel 4 XL? It could be an issue with google drive. Try to backup WhatsApp on a different google account from your old device and log in through that on the new one.

If all else fails you can resort to third-party software like dr fone. I used it to backup my WhatsApp on pc and it worked.

Best of luck :) i had the same problem years ago.  i've since rooted my phone and use Titanium Backup.  the first requirement is that you have rooted your phone.  root access allows you to access files normally unaccessible.  whatsapp files are located in 

&nbsp;

/data/data/com.whatsapp

/sdcard/WhatsApp

&nbsp;

the second location is where photos, videos, documents, voice clips are store.  after a while it will easily go over 30 GB.  i think mine is 60 GB.  it is prone to problem when you are relying on the backup method using Google Drive.  i learned the hard way.  root the phone first.  buy Titanium Backup.  do a test run how to backup and to restore WhatsApp complete with photos, videos, etc

&nbsp;

i am sorry to say that your present situation is a bit too late Hey, thank you for getting back to me, I appreciate it. Out of curiosity why is it too late? I still have the old phone and currently still have it as my active whatsapp account. I've rooted and used titanium backup before (although it's been a while), so I could do that and backup the old phone now, and then restore on the rooted new phone? take a backup of your good copy of WhatsApp.  use Titanium Backup to backup

&nbsp;

use any file explorer that support root.  copy /data/data/com.whatsapp

&nbsp;

copy /sdcard/WhatsApp

&nbsp;

keep a copy of those three

&nbsp;

on the new phone, install WhatsApp and register your number

&nbsp;

once activated it will still be empty

&nbsp;

use Titanium Backup to freeze it

&nbsp;

restore those three to the new phone

&nbsp;

use that file explorer with root access to change permission of /data/data/com.whatsapp and its children to allow access to all

&nbsp;

defrost WhatsApp

&nbsp;

if everything went well, you can go back to WhatsApp and find all of your old messages including photos, videos, etc.  in my case, the stickers I already saved are gone.  but that I can still live with

&nbsp;

good luck and let us know how it goes Fantastic, really really appreciate this--I will keep you posted! unfortunately didn't work out--nothing wrong with any of your instructions, but I barely made it into the process at all, was unlocking the bootloader and cmd window gave me a ""connect any device message."" Everything was fine with computer detecting pixel 5, all drivers up to date, disabled auto install of new drivers, but couldn't get it to detect pixel 5 in fastboot mode. At this point just going to call it. thanks for your help though, definitely going to root my next phone and get titanium backup on there in advance of issues like this!"

Is there any other way to retrieve them, or at least the contact details of the person sending them?;2020-12-02 10:39:42;"WhatsApp is fucked up in this manner mate. 

1. They don't back up properly everything

3. No automatic storage in cloud. 

Better to shift to telegram. 

1. Everything is backed up in Cloud
2. You can delete messages any time unlike WhatsApp

I didn‚Äôt pay my phone bill for a while and now my cell phone number is given to someone else. I was kicked out of whatsapp and someone else is using that number. I even texted to a group that has the old number and saw the person read it. I‚Äôm paranoid now about them accessing data from my groups/chats, and how can I potentially retrieve those whatsapp chats? 

I have another cell number with WhatsApp active.";2020-12-02 01:18:33;"The other person won't be able to see your old chats. Your google drive or iCloud backup requires you to log in before restoring your chat.
Try asking the other person to give you the authentication code from whatapp. Then you can log in again and change your whatapp number to the new number.
If nothing works and you have your old chat in your cell phone you can try to restore that by putting the encrypted files of your old chat in the appropriate folder and reinstalling whatapp. You can log in with your new account and see if it gives you an option to restore chat from local backup. 
Best of luck :) I'm not sure how a cell phone can be instantly given to someone else without the handset being restored/wiped and the cell phone number being formally reassigned to someone else instead of given.

It seems like the phone has been taken out of your hands as it was and given to someone else to use from that point forward? Unless the new owner gives you access you don't really have any other options I hope you solve this. 
Maybe try contacting the new owner? Mobile phone number is the only method used by WhatsApp to identify who you are. If your phone number has been lost or used by others, I think the only way to get your account back is to contact your mobile phone number provider. See if they can help.

 In our country, mobile phone numbers are tied to personal information identities, so phone provider usually don‚Äôt sell your mobile phone‚Äôs personal information to other people without your permission, and It is illegal. Even if your mobile phone number is no longer used, they will automatically clear your previous records before giving others to use.

&#x200B;

Hope you got your issue solved Sorry edited my post. My cell phone number was given :( cellphone is with me but I was kicked out of whatsapp Try contacting the person itself and explain it to What country are you in? I'm astounded that because you forgot to pay your bill, you phone company instantly gave your phone number to someone else."

Because if you report him, he may use another number or other social media to leak the information without your permission. Paying the money will always be the worst thing to do. Maybe go to the police like the other redditor said. [deleted] Thank you so much, I‚Äôll mention this and look into it thank you Where does a person go if they want to start filing a cyber case? Nobody is going to kill you for 2000 bucks. Posting your nudes are other matter. If you're minor, he can't post your photos without getting himself in trouble.

File a case for extortion and blackmailing. He'd go to jail. Don't delete his chat. It's a easy form to get 2000 bucks. I recommend you to change your phone number but firsts screenshots. If you are really really really scared, you can go to the police station and ask for help. It depends upon the Country and Local Jurisdiction.

For Example I Live in India and Near Kelera, So I Can File a Cyber Case Online via [https://cybercrime.gov.in/](https://cybercrime.gov.in/) or going local police station and filling an FIR (First-Information Report) aka Case. I agree! and... if is in Whatsapp, you police can easily recognize the stupid person who is behind."

&#x200B;

I've done it when my father switched from android to iphone xr a couple years ago, and recently when my wife switched from android to iOS.  Everything transferred over (with over 10gb of meda files) without a hitch. I just switched from Galaxy S10+ to iPhone 12 pro. Found this video via Google search https://youtu.be/ZU592-doP_0

Tried the app mentioned in the video and it worked for me. It transferred all the chats and media files (from the year 2017) to my iPhone 12 pro. It costed me INR 1500/USD 20 for one month subscription. Now I cancelled the subscription because I don‚Äôt think I will need it again. It sucks that still there is no free way to do it. I just used Dr. Fone:

It cost me about $38 CAD to purchase through the site and you can also pay via PayPal. Everything was smooth, taking you step-by-step with easy to follow instructions. Did take me about 20 minutes or so, however highly worth it since chat history is important if you don't want to lose some of that data. Would recommend. Cheers!"

Can people randomly add you on WhatsApp?;1;k3ki56;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/k3ki56/can_people_randomly_add_you_on_whatsapp/;8;[deleted];2020-11-30 03:02:55;"What is ""random"". If the person has his number they can sent him a message. His number might have been leaked from a website for example. Of course anyone can add any number and message it. Just like with text messages, normally this means the 2 know each other but that's not necessarily the case. No Yes its Possible, Some of the Possibility are

1. Leaked from Database or Websites or by Friends or Family Circle
2. Bulk Phone Numbers like +91874XXX0000 - 91874XXX9999 using a spam bot and pretend to be honey trap (As you mention she and no links and other things not given).
3. there is a 3rd Party app in Play store that gives number to Strangers to have chat. Hi, random as in, he did not have the person‚Äôs number in the first place and had no idea how he got his number. It could be possible his number was leaked, but I would expect scammers to message him. This might be a scam, what type of message did she sent him? Was it a message from an stranger or just someone he/she met before but never gave his/her number?

Anyways, you can just add a random number as contact in your phone and see if it is activated in whatsapp, no need for the other person to give you the number or accept a friend's request.

Once you sent a message, the other person gets the message and the option to block/report your number but other than that, nothing more. [deleted] One thing you can do is search your friend's number in google and see if it is not coming in any web site or so.

It could be that someone else's gave this girl a ""fake"" number instead of their real one and just turned to be your friend's number.

Or just a typo which also turned out to be your friend's number."

Still, for multiple reasons I need to keep using WhatsApp with that number for as long as possible. But I'm afraid of what will happen if someone else gets the number and registers WhatsApp.

Will I at that point still be able to automatically notify all my contacts of my new number so that at least those with open conversations see the change?";2020-11-30 02:16:39;"I would tell them now because as soon as the number is used with WhatsApp again, you‚Äôll be logged out and won‚Äôt be able to send any messages. Are you sure about it? Is there any way to avoid it with two factor authentication or something?

That's basically what I fear. That somehow I have no more access to the account and no way to change and automatically notify about my new number. WhatsApp sends an SMS  to verify the number. That‚Äôs not going to work as you no longer have the number. So you only have two choices. Either notify everyone of your new number now or try to get your old number back."

Note if you're using 24 hours close then you need to change it to 12 hours before exporting. Thank you!"

Chances are, someone posted your number in any WhatsApp group. I feel you, unfortunately there is nothing you can do other than block and report You could change your number. 
Depdens where you live, the police might help you also. Just block them and report spam. This will stop. My friend had the same problem, someone posted her number on a dating app with nude pics and she was receiving messages from like 60 contacts, the only way is to ask these contacts were did they find ur number and to report the person who posted it I would report the numbers to the police. Also, if possible, you can get a new number, which I would recommend since they might start calling you as well.

You can definitely do a cloud backup (so if the phone is lost/broken, the data is still available) but I'd also reach out to WhatsApp to ask if maybe they help transfer the data into a readable format, maybe some kind of tool to turn it into an html page or pdf, so you can read through your convos. https://youtu.be/NwjN2OVZrvw

I hope this helps!
Sorry for your loss, stay strong! Okay,
Another alternative option is
Install a chrome browser extension like GoFullPage
Use whatsapp web
Open the chat from the earliet message you have
Click on the camera üì∏ button on the tools bar in chrome ( this appears once you insall the extension)
Your whole chat would be exported to PDF what is your phone ?  ios or Android ?  i use an app called FooView on my Android.  it will automatically scroll down and take a screenshot.  There is another app that will do exactly the same but i like FooView better because it has other functions so i tend to use it more often Thanks for your help, i messaged them and am currently waiting for them to answer. I hope they have an idea. Hey, thanks for your help. Sadly I seem to live in the only country (germany) which doesn't support exporting chats. Still can't wrap my head around why they would make it this hard for us... I have Android...

The Problem ist that i think the picture might be too big.. It's 6 years of daily conversation.

I tried GoFullPage yesterday through the web Version, it almost took an hour to unfreeze my Laptop. Can you login to web.whatsapp.com and screenshot all the chat history instead? i would give FooView a shot.  it will 

&nbsp;

automatically take multipe screenshots

&nbsp;

automatically scroll the screen down between screenshots

&nbsp;

automatically sticth those screenshots into one longer screenshot

&nbsp;

automatically stop when it reached the max limit

&nbsp;

at this point you need to manually save the stitched screenshot and repeat the process until you have all 6 years saved

&nbsp;

note : FooView takes a bit of learning curve, let me know if you need help doing this

&nbsp;

i would do this if i knew this 20 years ago.  my mom passed away before the times of WhatsApp and Android.  dumb smartphone back then.  good luck.  let us know if you find a different way.  hopefully will be useful for others.  if you read this until this line, my Instagram is budiQX **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

Export +40,000 Messages?;2;k2cpkv;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/k2cpkv/export_40000_messages/;3;"Hello,

Is there a way without either a) rooting my phone or b) paying for software, that I can export as .txt (or export somehow and convert) a thread with over 80,000 messages in?

Secondly, does anyone know if there's a way to access how many texts you've sent someone/gone between you now? It used to be in data, but they've reworked that screen to just include images which is absolutely useless.

Thank you!";2020-11-28 03:00:37;"one thread with 80K+ messages can be exported into a txt file without any app.  WhatsApp itself supports it.  You don't need any root either You can use dr fone to export your chat to pc. There is no need to pay for the software because you don't need to restore your chat later. Once the chat is exported, search for msgstore.db in explorer. Open it using WhatsApp viewer (it's free software that you can find from a google search). Located the desired chat and export it in JSON or txt format. 

It's a bit tedious process but you only need to do it once. After that, you can directly export chat from WhatsApp after a month or two (depending on how active the group is). You can manually combine all the chats in one file. I wrote a little python code to combine chats automatically that I'll be happy to share. 

PS: You can use GBwhastapp to export the chat too if you don't wanna use dr fone. But I have heard some users getting temporarily banned from using moded WhatsApp.

If your device is rooted then you don't need to use dr fone or GBWhatsApp, you can get the msgstore.db file directly from data/data/com folder.

Be sure to backup chats on google drive first. 

Hope this helps. :) How? When I export it caps out at 40,000. There is no way of getting more than 40,000 texts by exporting?"

Does anyone know how to fix it? or is this a problem with whatsapp or youtube itself?  does anyone know what's going on?";2020-11-26 19:46:51;"I currently have the same problem, so it's probably a bug on WhatsApp's end.

This happened before occasionally. I imagine WhatsApp is working on a fix. It's not a bug, it's on YouTube's end. They change something about the way their embeds work and previews disappear. This happened before both here and on Telegram. it realy was on YouTube's end, they have fixed it. Same link from Android works but when posting it from iOS it doesn‚Äôt show preview Still not working for me. Still works if you use WhatsApp desktop application, which seems weird if they disabled it for that reason. WhatsApp Business youtube sharing working fine
But its not working in the original WhatsApp.

Please fix Same problem on Android and in Whatsapp desktop for MacOS  (10.14 Mojave).

In both, you get a preview for YouTube iteslf if you erase the link backwards, when there's just [https://youtu.be](https://youtu.be) left.

I have a feeling that this won't be fixed. Yeah I believe this is deliberate so you don‚Äôt simply watch in the preview screen. This way you have to click the link & actually go to YouTube where of course you are bombarded by ads unless have ad blocker. They are working on a fix for this then? Did it fix for you? doesnt work for me either...any thoughts? Whatsapp desktop or web client doesn't work for me but the mobile app does. Go figure... I've just uninstalled and reinstalled in Windows 10, and the got damn thing still isn't working for me. It's probably random at the moment who it works for and who it doesn't! Most likely, yeah. It usually takes a day or two and then the previews are back. yes. Youtube/Google has probably pulled the plug, Whatsapp/Facebook being a competitor and all, and not enough incentive to allow it. Same as when Alexa devices stopped playing YT videos or iPhone stopped playing YT in background / no  PiP support and so on and so forth. Well it's been a few and no change yet :\ i hope not, after all, the users are the same, we use all of those products, so the more they interact more we will use then."

WhatsApp Desktop Writes 30 GB To Disk;2;k1dqch;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/ouyg1jdijk161.png;2;;2020-11-26 14:33:56;"Occasionally (i.e. once a week or so), I discover in TaskManager that WhatsApp has suddenly written several gigabytes to my harddisk - see screenshot. I write ""suddenly"" because normally it's in the 50-100 megabytes range - still a lot for an app that manages mainly text messages but quite ok. And then, within an hour maybe, it spikes to 30,000 megabytes!

 Fortunately, I don't yet have an SSD, it would be soon destroyed.

My question is: What the hell is WhatsApp doing? Does it send ""home"" my entire C: drive for studying my personal computer use? I am not a fan of conspiracy theories, but this stinks... any idea what could be the issue here? I finally cornered that WhatsApp bug: It starts writing to disk, at a rate of 3MB per second, when you post to somebody **a link to a video**. Yes, a URL, not the video itself. Every sane programmer would say ""oh, a URL is just text, that's 50 bytes or so"", but nope, buggy WhatsApp starts writing **3MB per second**.

Account takeover;2;k1101a;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/k1101a/account_takeover/;1;"Today sometime very strange happened, I got a notification from WhatsApp with a registration code. I had not requested the code since I had not changed my device or anything. I ignored it since I knew that if someone was attempting to takeover my account they would have to get the code somehow. 

A few seconds later I got a pop up message on WhatsApp that my device had been delinked or deactivated from my WhatsApp account, then I got an option to get a new code via text or a call, I chose call and I received an automated call with the code. I input the code and I got my account back. The strange thing is that in those few seconds, whoever had taken over my account had changed my profile pic.

My question to anyone who might know, is how without the code sent to my phone, my account was taken over. I didn't click on any suspicious link nor did I receive a text asking me to share the code. How did this happen?";2020-11-26 00:11:47;It might be brute force or hacked try enable two step verification immediately

This does NOT happen with voice only Whatsapp call. It works just as intended. 

The workaround that I found effective is to start the call as voice call and once the other person answers switch to video. In this case the bluetooth headset works as intended.

Is this an Android or Whatsapp problem?

Deleting WhatsApp photos after backing up and upgrading to new phone before syncing to google photos;1;k0u5li;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/k0u5li/deleting_whatsapp_photos_after_backing_up_and/;1;"Hi all, I recently upgraded from my Samsung Galaxy S7 to the Pixel 4a 5G. Before switching, I back up all of my photos/videos including my WhatsApp photos & videos to Google Photos. I also removed the nomedia file from my sent WhatsApp folders so they'd be visible and uploaded them as well.

Now that I've switched over phones over, I restored my WhatsApp from my WhatsApp backup, which immediately downloaded all of the WhatsApp photos/videos onto my new phone.

Here's my question: I'd like to turn on the sync for the WhatsApp folder to capture all new photos that come in (my wife and I send a lot of family photos back and forth this way), but I'm afraid that if I turn on sync for that folder now, it'll just re-backup all those already uploaded WhatsApp photos & videos from my last phone's backup and then I'll have a bunch of duplicates. Would that be the case or would Google Photos go ""ah, I've already got all those photos from before, no need to upload"" (even though it's on a new phone)? Do I need to just delete all my media through the WhatsApp app (knowing that it's already backed up on google photos and can be viewed all through there)?

If I do delete it all and then turn on the sync for the WhatsApp folder, the only photos that will be uploaded to google photos will be the new ones, I assume?

Many thanks for any help.";2020-11-25 18:27:44;GPhotos ignores duplicate files.

She wasn't to know that this would occur, there was no such warning in the app, so the data loss in my view is not on her.

Why is the app backing up while a restore is taking place? Seems a bit of an obvious thing to have it NOT do?

And given iCloud only APPEARS to store one backup, is there ANY chance that her data can be recovered?

Google drive doesnt let me do much to the file or whats saved in there.";2020-11-24 21:49:47;"I don't why WhatsApp does that, as the local backup is often the newest one. What I do is switch on airplane mode at that point, so it just can only find the backup from the SD. just locate the dbcrypt file to databases folder

it will local restore than gdrive Uninstall whatsapp but don't delete the app data

Disconnect your whatsapp backup from Google drive. 

Drive>settings>manage apps 
Scroll down to whatsapp messenger. 
Click on options and select disconnect from drive.

Once this is done, reinstall whatsapp.

Verify and then it will pickup the database folder from the phone and restore messages. They should give a choice actually. 
To restore from drive or local . I've tried that. Still picks up the file in google drive Just tried that. It still searches for the google drive and theres nothing there. Its either the google drive or nothing it seems It shouldn't search for Google drive once it is disconnected. I had to restore from local a couple of days ago when I changed my phone and that's what I did. 

Weird that it is still searching for Google drive. Yep. Doesnt seem to want to look in my files. Frustrating Did you try what I suggested? In airplane mode it will obviously not access Google Drive. Are you sure your files are in the internal memory and not the SD one? Post the whole path or a screenshot of what you have if you cannot solve it. Yeah tried that approach but it was just stuck searching for google drive.
 The file is in internal memory. 
I've done this before when whatsapp would look in the internal memory. Its just this new google drive bit thats thrown me off"

U can either introduce any of these things. 

1. Only the first notification of the messege is heard. And u can see only pop ups for the rest of them for like 1 minute. Until u see that messege after going inside the chat. After coming out of the chat the next notification again becomes first notification from the same chat. 

2. Or you can introduce just pop ups seen feature. Not just a notification icon when the messege comes when muted. 

Kindly introduce this because talking to such people is too annoying and we cant tell them in face that u type so slowly so i dont have paitence to see ur messeges so i mute u and see other things.

But, if for some strange reason you are not able to get your phone number back, maybe writing your history urgently on Medium would help you in getting more attention from them.

But more details will be needed. How did it happen? Ie how was your account compromised? I had a strange experience today regarding my WhatsApp that I'm still trying to wrap my head around. Just write to them saying hacked , please deactivate my account (give only your number with country code with no spaces). Once your account is deactivated the hacker is gone. If he set up 2fa, then you have to wait 7 days until you can reset it. It's locked anyway so you are safe. Their reply time varies but shouldn't be more than 24 hours sometimes in seconds. The way things work you are likely to be replied earlier if you don't keep on writing, most support has a time frame, you don't want to leave your line by going back asking again or creating a new query. I have my phone number but not the WhatsApp nor the 2fa I accidentally gave out my code I can‚Äôt because their customer support only sends me automated messages I have yet to speak to a person no matter how many emails I‚Äôve sent Your phone number and whatsapp number is the same. If you forgot your 2FA PIN, then it's on you. How did this turn out for you? I have the same issue now No my 2FA was activated by a hacker so I can‚Äôt get in I had to reset the pin and wait a week and got it back So you didn't turn it on? It's 100% on you then. 2FA exists for a reason and would've prevented this. What do you mean by reset the pin? I feel like I should be able to reach customer support to atlesst reset 2FA.

My wife and I had moved countries couple of months ago. She got a new sim and phone, started new chats with her old contacts on her new number as she wasn't aware of the change number feature but she now wants to change the number on her old phone to merge the old chats. However, my concern is that once she does that in case if there are conversations with the same contacts on both numbers would it wipe out the new chats?

Thanks in advance for your help.";2020-11-23 21:15:37;"Partially answering your question. You don't lose any conversation if you:

1. Put the new SIM on the same phone where the conversations are *(no matter if you remove the old SIM or not)* and inform WhatsApp that you have a new number, or
2. Put the old SIM on a new phone, re-validate your WhatsApp number, gaining access to the latest backup and, after restoring it, execute step 1 *(put new SIM and inform number changing)* If she already started new conversation with the new phone number separately, I suspect that she **will lose the new conversations** on both cases below:

&#x200B;

1. if she puts the new SIM on the old phone to use the ""change number"" feature, or
2. put the old SIM on the new phone in order to bring the old number and its backup and, later, informing the number changing... Therefore, if she values all conversations made on the old number more than the new ones, I recommend that **she stop continuing the conversations on the new number separately** and, first:  


1. Put the new SIM on the old phone
2. Inform the number change
3. Ask WhatsApp to do a new backup
4. Reinstall WhatsApp on the new phone (or clear its ""App data"")

In native WhatsApp it's not possible, and AFAIK there's no API for WhatsApp so it's probably pretty hard to write a bot to do it.

Free up space;1;jzcm76;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jzcm76/free_up_space/;3;"Hi All,

I have a question about the 'Free up space' feature in Whatsapp. It's worth saying firstly that it appears to be a really great feature added to streamline the process of erasing data on the device.

When I use the feature to clear, say, all pictures & videos for a particular chat, is this media *definitely* available still in the backup? And when the phone backs up in future will these files (now no longer on the device) remain or will they be deleted from backup?

I am pretty certain I am massively overthinking this. However a lot of my WhatsApp data is of huge sentimental value and to lose any of it carelessly would be a disaster.

I've tried WhatsApp's 'ask a question' page but all I got was a stock answer whuch didn't give me the confidence to press the button. I'd really like if a human who knows for sure could give me some advice.

Thank you!";2020-11-23 09:39:40;"What you backed up on your google drive should be there, the free up space is the data that is there on your device. If you are unsure, try doing a mock for a test chat. delete it's media after backing up on google drive and restore to confirm.

I personally keep my data safe on an external hdd or my laptop. WhatsApp backups mirror the local backup. If you delete it from the phone, it'll be erased from further backups as well. Thanks for the reply. I had thought about doing something like this. I'll give it a try. üëç"

I tried to take the sim card out of my old phone and put it on the new phone, but it doesn't transfer all of the data. I have 5 groups on my Whatsapp, but only 4 groups also by any chance I can transfer chat history as well?

Mt situation is quite different. My mom actually is using my old phone which contains my iCloud and app sotre and other information. She just using a rechargeable phone card and not a sim card from roger, bell, etc... Now that I changed my phone, I can give my old phone to her.

I have asked her to just buy a new phone with Simcard, but she said no. She said she doesn't need a new phone as she barely uses it. We immigrant to here, nobody will call her as she really doesn't know English and she doesn't go outside alone so basically a phone is unnecessary she said. She just wants a WhatsApp so that she can chat with her family.

I use iTunes to backup my iPhone5 and I planned to restore it on my iPhone6, but my question is will it affect my Iphone12 since we both shared the same iCloud and  AppStore account.";2020-11-23 04:38:10;"Yes If you are not getting the complete backup, you need to ask in WhatsApp Settings to create a new backup.  


Only after creating this new (recent) backup, move the SIM to the other phone, reinstall WhatsApp, re-validate your number and accepts the backup again (that will be more recent). If the backup option doesn't work or doesn't appear, be sure to login into your Google account first (for example, by installing Google Drive and logging in first), so WhatsApp will be able to do the backup accordingly.  


Also, on your new phone, be sure to login into your Google Account before reinstalling WhatsApp, for the same reason."

I tried whatsapp web and on the latest chrome and edge, the same happens. However on firefox it works fine. I uninstalled chrome and put Firefox as a default in windows, but the app still has the same issue. Im guessing its using edge as default renderer but i cant uninstall or downgrade edge..

Worst case i can use whatsappweb in firefox, but j prefer the app.

Any ideas please?";2020-11-22 14:15:10;"For anyone interested I managed to solve this. There is absolutely no info on the net regarding this issue, all the info I found was related to whatsapp web not working in a browser,  but not specifically to the desktop app not loading the QR Code correctly, not even Whatsapp support offered a solution.

To re stress the issue, my QR code WAS loading it just wasn't loading correctly, it was like bad quality, not rendering entirely.

I solved this issue by running the app in compatibility mode and choosing Windows Vista (service Pack 2). After doing that, the app runs perfectly and the QR Code was rendered correctly. I'm guessing this is an issue with the latest windows updates since it also seems to affect Whatsapp Web on the latest Chrome and Edge. I've seen a few others mention this issue as well. Can you share a few more details like screen resolution? Some people say it happens on high resolution screens more often. Sometimes different browsers work better as well. Once you have more info, sending it to the real WhatsApp support (support@support.WhatsApp.com) will let the developers get more data about what causes this issue.

This may be related to buggy hardware accelerated rendering in some web browsers (eg chrome). Try turning hardware acceleration off in your web browser and see if that fixes the issue for you, and let us know if that works. It was happening on 4k ultra wide. Latest intel graphics driver update fixed the issue. Previous to the update, removing hardware acceleration on Chrome also fixed it. Another fix was to run WhatsApp desktop in comparability mode as windows 7 so I don't see how it can be due to resolution, it's a intel driver issue."

Weird;1;jydbrm;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jydbrm/weird/;0;Does anyone have some Weird problem I use iPhone on iOS 14.2 and when i try to send photo od video the app crashes and just exit;2020-11-21 19:13:46;
Wi-fi issues;1;jycg10;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jycg10/wifi_issues/;0;"So, i have this weird issue with whatsapp, specifically. My internet works fine on absolutely everything, but whenever my phone is locked for too long, i will loose connection to whatsapp web.

Once i unlock my phone, if i try to send a message to anyone (i do this on a group i have with myself only), the message doesn't even gets sent. The only workaround for this i've found, is disconnecting my cellphone from the wifi, then reconnecting it. After a few seconds, either it pulls up my 4g and sends the message, resuming service as normal once wifi is back on, or the wifi just works again - until i lock my phone again for whatever reason, then its a crapshoot when it will happen again, but it will happen.

Also, the same problem doesn't happen with my 4g, granted i actually have coverage wherever i am.

I know this is a niche issue, but has anyone else come across this?";2020-11-21 18:21:59;
Adding 2 New Cool Features In WhatsApp;1;jybgtf;whatsapp;https://cutt.ly/uhrNdF5;0;;2020-11-21 17:19:10;
This is how I screwed up backup, I'm legit not feeling great right now. I need help.;1;jybgsd;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jybgsd/this_is_how_i_screwed_up_backup_im_legit_not/;2;"So my best friend told me about my WhatsApp being an older version, so I went to check and update it. However, there was no update button. So my dumbass went to Uninstall and Reinstall. Now here's the problem: I set my Google Drive to backup messages weekly. So, poof. One week worth of messages are gone.

I got so mad because:

1. I got notes there
2. A girl and I are very close, we text each other a LOT. But just because of my dumbass, 1 week worth of memories are gone.

(Currently texting her much less because I don't wanna be a simp, I just show some social activity and she'll know I am human too and that I'm not needy)

I tried doing the whole rename the crypt thing, but it doesn't work, and my best friend sent pictures of his assignment so it probably got overwritten. I backed up the recent one, and now I won't be able to get back the info. Could someone perhaps help me if you know how to solve this? I'm legit mindfucked rn. Without the notes and texts, my mind will be in a legit mess.

TL;DR: Friend told me update, I reinstalled WhatsApp with only a weekly backup, one week of notes and texts with a girl gone";2020-11-21 17:19:07;"Nope. Check backup before uninstall.

The memories are in your head. Live on. Make new memories. I will live on, but for now I just can't help but feel extremely disappointed at myself because I'm such a fucking dumbass."

Whatsapp send location as Facebook pages, can it be changed?;18;jy9uzh;whatsapp;https://v.redd.it/y2hhw8ov5l061;3;;2020-11-21 15:21:56;"Seems like the app which is the default for opening map locations is set to your browser. Try resetting the default opening options for your browser which is opening. Settings > apps > your browser > default settings (this is translated) > reset default settings. Ok so this stopped it opening directly in Samsung Internet, but the ""open with"" options are Chrome or Samsung Internet. I have Google Maps installed, but doesn't even give me an option. And even when I open with Chrome it goes to Facebook, not Maps. So it does seem to be defaulted to Facebook. I can't find any defaults or settings in WhatsApp to stop it using Facebook. Frustrating! Well you could try clearing the defaults for all the apps in question. WhatsApp, Facebook, Maps, Chrome and Samsung internet. If nothing works, try the nuclear option ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ"

Solved: iCloud backup not found;2;jxz1hr;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jxz1hr/solved_icloud_backup_not_found/;0;"Posting here and hopefully this may help one of you one day.

I have moved my WhatsApp from one iOS device to another and got a message that ‚ÄúWhatsApp can‚Äôt/doesn‚Äôt find any iCloud backup‚Äù while I have made a backup just a few min before.

What I found out is that the backup is tied to the name of the phone
Settings-general-about-name
And that name must match the name of the phone used for the WhatsApp iCloud backup 

So what I did was to rename the phone to the right name then reboot and then install WhatsApp and it found the backup

Whatsapp Web (Microsoft Edge) not working AFTER update.;2;jx6925;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jx6925/whatsapp_web_microsoft_edge_not_working_after/;1;" So, my whatsapp web was working fine until just a few hours ago when I was met with this. I was confused as when I opened an InPrivate window it worked fine, so I just left it for a bit, hoping it was just a glitch.  
After a few minutes, it became clear it wasn't, so I decided to try and just update Microsoft Edge, but it became clear that it was not the issue as my Edge was up to date. So, I decided to update my Windows.

After about 3 hours (I have bad internet and a slow PC) it was finally updated, I booted microsoft edge and started opening all the tabs I had closed, I came to whatsapp, tried to open it and again... doesn't work, even though I have JUST updated Windows. I even checked to see if I need to go on and update my Edge now and AGAIN, it's already fully updated (see bellow picture) and is even ABOVE version 80, just like it says it needs to be!

Once you have more info, sending it to the real WhatsApp support (support@support.WhatsApp.com) will let the developers get more data about what causes this issue.

This may be related to buggy hardware accelerated rendering in some web browsers (eg chrome). Try turning hardware acceleration off in your web browser and see if that fixes the issue for you, and let us know if that works. Hey thanks for the reply and sorry for my late reply, the monitor I use normally is a curved 1440p monitor, but the issue occurs even on my laptop (not curved and only 1080p), I'll try turning again as I recently turned hardware acceleration off in chrome, thanks for the tip I hadn't heard that one before."

Is this not just a timed Mute button with extra PRspeak on top? i think this would be useful for group chats that i have to be in, but don't need to participate in often. so it'll be nice to have those chats dormant, until i need to participate again at any time.

even with the mute button, the group chat is constantly being pushed to the top, and it's a risk for many people that accidentally post things into the wrong chat, especially with chats if over 100 people.."

The only thing that has resolved this is that I ended up getting an iPhone 12 Pro anyway and now everything works as it's supposed to. Once i had the same issue but with fv Messenger and i have no idea how I fixed that...but do one thing.  
Go to the settings and look for ""accounts"" and in there turn on the sync for WhatsApp. Let me know if this helps. Have a wonderful day ahead!! I had this issue but it was fixed when I paid my data service. What do you mean by ""it is running in the background""? Do you mean that you are not getting notifications when you close WhatsApp if you swipe it up?

Reset my phone, now whatsapp media not loading, all question mark;3;jwcbxx;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/gallery/jwcbxx;4;;2020-11-18 11:45:09;"Hey guys!

question here. ive just reset my phone and used a backup to reinstall my iphone. now that i've done that whatsapp asked if i want to use a previous backed up which has over 13gb. I clicked yes but once i've downloaded the app, all my chat history is back BUT my medias (including photo,videos, gifts) are all showing up as question marks!? I tried to log in on my mac too through the web app. and there i am able to see about 10% of the photos,videos. still most of it are missing.

&#x200B;

What frustrates me is that i know for a fact these date are backed up in my icloud. whatsapp even tells me i have over 13gb of videos etc. but it only LOADED my chat history. makes no sense!  (my icloud drive is also turned on) where can i access these videos and photos? i cant seem to do that even tho i know for a fact it's stored in my backup. anyone had similar issues? 

you'll see in the attached images that it only loaded 330mb or so..and it says the media will load in the background. I've tried this several times since yesterday. downloading, install, uninstalling the app, reseting the phone etc and nothing seems to fix this.

&#x200B;

at this point i just want to find a way to extract those medias and in the future i will keep my own backup outside of whatsapp. it seems very unreliable.

&#x200B;

anyone know what to do? would be great if someone can help me out here! thank you! When you do a restore, it downloads the messages first and then the media in the background. (So that you can get on and use it). You should find the media will slowly appear. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt try messing around with backups while it‚Äôs doing this or it might never complete.  

If the media haven‚Äôt appeared in a day or so then contact WhatsApp. Hi man!

I am having the same problem. Did you ever find a solution to this? It's weird. I have never had a problem doing this with my previous iPhones. WhatsApp doesn't even have help desk. I called Apple but they didn't have a clue either. It's a very frustrating problem...

I am looking forward to hearing from you! Thanks! it‚Äôs been 2 days already and still doesn‚Äôt load. i‚Äôve contacted whatsapp unfortunately not to my surprise they are not helpful at all. but thanks fro the rec üò≠üò≠"

I called her out on her scam so she posted my number in a comment on my friends Facebook page. She said she would only remove it unless I bought a steam card which I obviously know better than to do that.

1- no profile picture
2- no last seen
3- no status/description
4- no double checkmarks when texting them.
they all have to be gone for you to be blocked, if only 3/4, or 1/4, etc are or are not showing,  you aren't blocked. If you see two ‚òë it means you're not blocked Thanks for your detailed answer!"

- Add a pre-defined message in link
- Shorten generated WhatsApp link
- Create branded links by adding Slug / Slash Tag to your short url
- Simply copy and paste number from your recent call logs
- WhatsApp text formatting (coming soon)

I hope this helps you. Lol such a pain. Nobody ever thought of a ""send message to number"" feature after all these years that whatsapp is in existence?

I just moved to a country where whatsapp is main mode of communication which is why I just started using the app. The UX is horrible on so many levels lol. What a pain. Its probably worse than just saving the new number as a contact a d messaging them. Why isn't there just a ""send message to new number"" option in WhatsApp and I type the number... Completely agree with you. WhatsApp needs a heavy revamp in the UI and also more features need to be added. The dev team is horrendous. Compared to Telegram, WhatsApp is way far behind in developing their shit To reduce spam, most likely. I get more spam from whatsapp than any other messaging service so thats definitely not the issue lol Out of curiosity, do you report the spam?

Interestingly, I've never gotten spam, but I'm American and WhatsApp isn't super popular in the US like it is in some countries. Yes of course..but in SEA...you can imagine lots of loans and money spammers from all over Asia lol. And sadly no setting to make it so only contact list can message me or only people from my country can send me messages, since my country has really strict spam rules its always from abroad"

Whatsapp hacked. I didn‚Äôt forward any code! Pls help.;5;jun1bd;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jun1bd/whatsapp_hacked_i_didnt_forward_any_code_pls_help/;13;[deleted];2020-11-15 17:54:29;"It seems like your (old) provider just assigned your old number to someone else and you aren't hacked. You should've changed your number earlier to the number you actually used. 
I'm not sure what you mean that your local police changed to Spanish.

WhatsApp works by phone number, so are you saying that the phone number of the local police station changed to a Spanish phone number, or a non-Spanish phone number now has a Spanish sounding name?

The names in your WhatsApp are set by your contact book I thought. Can you explain more about what's going on or give an example (that doesn't dox yourself of course). I'm not as familiar with iPhone as with Android devices but I believe the app is the same.

WhatsApp doesn't store contacts, each what'sapp account can be edited by the owner to include a picture, name and status which can't be edited by anyone else.

When a message is sent to another WhatsApp user it combines the phone number with the babe for them in your contacts and the owners picture. If you don't know the contact messaging you instead of the name showing you just get the number and photo. 

Therefore if your getting these new numbers attached to names them something is wrong with your contacts, not WhatsApp.

MY GUESS: a contact backup or auto merge similar contacts went wrong ( Google is bad for this, their merge tool does my head in with family. If I put dad and Steve's dad as 2 contacts it wants to merge as same person)

You probably have multiple accounts on your phone ( Apple, Google, Microsoft etc) for various apps, all of which are capable of storing contacts. 

SOLUTION: you should hunt through your contacts options ( I'm not an iPhone guy so your on your own finding it) and find the different accounts to work out which one WhatsApp is using and then fix it, easyiest way will likely be to change your contacts that are correct to default account so that WhatsApp picks them up.
Also make a note of one of the new phone numbers and start typing that in to your dialer or contacts search and see what comes up. Also vice versa make a note of a friends number and send a WhatsApp message to that number and see what if it labels the message and if it does what to. If it's a different name Search that name in contacts and see what's there...

Contacts are the key

Good luck, if you need more explaining I'm happy to help Hello, check your messages(normal) and look for WhatsApp verification code texts. If you see any of those and you have not requested the there are possibilities that your account is being hacked. this is the special features from whatsapp

&#x200B;

everyone can acces your whatsapp account

enjoy it :)

/s You should really backup your contacts on Google ""Contacts"" app. [deleted] [deleted] I don't know about that but I think that that is just some weird syncing bug with Whatsapp. This completely sounds like the classic number got assigned to a new person thing.

&#x200B;

Try reinstalling Whatsapp. It sounds like you have two different problems then. I don't think someone taking over your old account has anything to do with issues with your contacts on your new account. I'm wondering if the number is in full international format or US-only format? Does it start with +1 or (for example) 340?

If the latter, then it might be that WhatsApp changed how it interprets new numbers, maybe because you changed countries as well?

Edited to add: Did you by chance use to live in the US Virgin Islands?

I'm guessing this because Spain's country code in +34 and the U.S. Virgin Islands use area code 340.

Edit 2: Oakland, California area code is (341), so that's another possibility.

Edit 3: Ottawa, Canada is 343, and the Cayman Islands are 345. Houston is 346. 347 is New York City. [deleted] So the number changed but the name of the contact stayed the same? Am I understanding that correctly?

If so, let me research how WhatsApp contact syncing works. Keep me updated, but I think Whatsapp just had a bug. [deleted] But in Whatsapp, with that new profile picture, status and number, it still says ‚ÄúX Police Department‚Äú?"

[Whatsapp FAQ Staying Safe](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/staying-safe-on-whatsapp/?lang=en)

Can you log in to your account?
They need to have the Sim card with your number to keep the account logged in.

Don't use third party apps like blue whatsapp or other than official whatsapp in app store or ios store.

Do you download anything?
Uninstall apps you may or may not have installed with the link provided or you think you didn't downloaded from official stores. Email support say your account was hacked please deactivate, give only your number with country code. And then you can try to login. If you can't see the timer, contact them again and say I need the code to login and they will reset the timer. Nope because i need a 6 digit code which i suppose is redirected to them Yes i foolshily cooparated and i cant log to my acounnt sense i need the 6 digit code which i does not seem to be sent to me
I have used obly the offical app from google play and i got it from a friend or some phone call That‚Äôs odd, it sounds like they may have taken over your phone number as the change number feature of WhatsApp requires a 6 digit code to be sent to the old number The 6 digit code is a two factor authentication feature the hackers turned on. Your only option is to contact WhatsApp support to let them know your account has been stolen and you'll be able to get your account back in 7 days. Don't fall for this again! ive tried and i have been able to call people eith no problem it seems like only whatsapp has been infected
The only thing wired about my calls are that i keep getting some from numbers i dont know Alright ive got the code but now i supppse they added 2 step verifucation and linked one or their emails so i cannot get in eithout the pin it says there i eill be in in 7 days but is there some way to bypass this https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/verification/about-two-step-verification No there is no way to bypass it.

Changing number question;4;jukque;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jukque/changing_number_question/;6;"When I change my phone number will my contacts receive a message saying that I changed?

Generally your friends already saved your phone number on their phones . once you change they get notification . hey you changed phone number?  oh you always change your number? But is this notification really a message they receive or is just the yellow/blue bar they are only going to see if they open a chat with me?

Normally we see this yellow/blue bar in groups, when people change their numbers but I don‚Äôt if it is the same for the individual contacts It will be a full alert, like normal whatsapp messages, with sound alert and all. And a pop-up saying ""rods2292 have changed his mobile number to xxxxxxxxxx, do you wish to change it for the old one?"" or something like that, but only for those who you have on your address book, not in groups only 1-1 conversations. Thanks! I didn‚Äôt know that!

At some point they must have changed the ""default"" setting on this thing. Because some of the folks had it on, and I can tell you there is no way my non-techie aunt in Germany turned it on.

I'd definitely contact WhatsApp support so they know about the bug too. I tried both Chrome and Edge but the code comes up that way on both. I tried disabling dark mode and all Chrome extensions (don't have any on Edge) but that didn't work. The code looks wonky on the desktop app as well. It did render properly on Firefox when I tried it there, so I'm guessing it's Chromium related.

I contacted WhatsApp support but they haven't been of much help. Strange! Sorry I can't help more. I wonder if using chrome dev tools to inspect the CR code would provide any insights though.

Is that possible?  Thank you for your help :)";2020-11-14 15:23:58;"You can go to settings, account and privacy, adjust them like you like. The last seen option will not allow anybody to see when you are online or not. And you want to disable lecture confirmation to.
If you don't want absolutely no one writes you beside that 1 person then block all as previously advised. Block everyone you don‚Äôt want to know you have it is the simplest way Thank you very much for this reply.  I'm guessing that people will be able to see that I've suddenly installed Whatsapp, they just won't know if I'm actually online or not?

Ideally I wouldn't want anyone else to know I had it but that doesn't sound possible? The last seen options does show when you are online it doesn‚Äôt display when you were last seen that‚Äôs all it does. Nice username! Thanks for the reply. Can I install the app and just block people or are they all going to get a ping ""FuzzyServe has just installed WhatsApp""  ? They will only if they search in theirs whatsapp contacts, no they won't know if you are online or not.
No, I mean is possible only if people don't have your numbers.
Yo also make it appear like you installed but uninstall, just don't add photo, disable lecture confirmation, in this case if they send you a message and you don't respond they will think you have uninstalled the app and because there is no photo to show, they may ask you by call or sms and you can tell them you didn't like it and uninstalled but actually have it to chat only with that 1 person. Nobody gets told you installed it by notification, just install and immediately block and nobody will be any the wiser This is all really great and clear advice thank you. I think I'll go ahead and install it. I really appreciate you going go to the time and trouble to put this together for me - thank you again. I really appreciate your help, thank you so much billybellender"

One small difference is if there's a group you're in, you stay in the group even if you delete all the messages, and you can see other people in the group as well to determine their numbers."

WhatsApp loses connection to server every time I close app (iOS) - no notifications;13;jtqkoy;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jtqkoy/whatsapp_loses_connection_to_server_every_time_i/;10;"Latest iOS version running on iPhone X, with latest version of WhatsApp.

For the last 12 days or so, I have not been getting WhatsApp notifications. I have worked out that this is because every time I close the app on my phone, WA loses connection to the server. People sending me messages get only one tick. Only when I reopen WA, does it re-establish connection to the server, I receive any messages pending in the server and only then get them. When trying to use WhatsApp desktop app, it only updates when my WhatsApp is open on the phone, and when I close the phone app, the desktop app says the phone has lost connection.  


Video 1:

This is a screen capture. It shows my home screen with Whatsapp icon visible. There is no notification on the whatsapp icon to display ¬†that I have received a new message. I have notifications enabled for whatsapp. The beginning of the video is just staring at my home screen whilst a friend sends me a message. You will see that when I open whatsapp, the new notification only appears when the app is open and the connection to the server is established again.

[https://youtu.be/NNXM\_Y2zbA8](https://youtu.be/NNXM_Y2zbA8)  


Video 2:

This is a video of my Mac screen and phone screen at the same time. You will see:

1. The Mac app says my phone is not connected. When I click on the phone app to open Whatsapp, you will see that the Mac app now shows connection and notifications appear on both Mac and phone apps

2. When I close whatsapp on my phone, after approximately 45 seconds the Mac app says my phone has lost connection

3. When I reopen the phone app, the connection to the whatsapp server is re-established and both apps connect again, with new notifications coming through

ie. Whenever I close whatsapp on my phone, after about 30 seconds it loses connection to the whatsapp server and this connection remains lost until I reopen whatsapp again. Only once this connection is reestablished do I receive any notifications. I do not receive notifications on whatsapp when the app is closed as it has no connection, and I have confirmed this on my friends‚Äô whatsapps - when they send me a message and my phone app is not open, the message is not delivered to me. It is only delivered when I reopen the phone app and reconnect to the server

\- restart phone

Have been in touch with WA support but whilst they were previously replying after about 24 hours, following me sending them the videos above, they haven't replied in a few days. Can anyone help? This is a major problem and I'm sometimes missing vital notifications. Having to constantly open the app just to see if anything has come through. I believe this is a problem that other people have experienced as well (one person I know of personally, others via various forums where I've also posted, with no luck in figuring out why).";2020-11-14 01:58:07;"How about just waiting for a WhatsApp update.
Mine is not daily backing up. Thank god I‚Äòm at least not the only one experiencing that damn issue. I did the same things you did and even got my battery (iPhone X) replaced because I thought that‚Äòs the rootcause. It said ‚ÄöService‚Äò and Apple Diagnosis recommended a battery replacement for having full performance again.

Guess what... didn‚Äòt help at all...

Have you solved the issue yet? Got feedback of WhatsApp support? Hey man, I am experiencing the exact same issue as you, with the difference that my iPhone is brand new and running 14.3 Have you found a solution yet? No help from WhatsApp and they stopped answering when I sent them video proof of the problem. There is one other more popular Reddit thread on this issue with others saying the same thing is happening to them, as well as a thread I created on macrumors which others also corroborating the same problem. 

In the end I was going to get an iPhone 12 Pro anyway, so that arrived a few days ago. I set it up as a new phone, restored WhatsApp via backup, and was no longer having the issue any more. Then all the other Apple apps restored via iCloud and I manually installed the remaining apps I wanted. A long hassle process but sorted in the end. Think this is an issue with WhatsApp, iPhone X and iOS 14.2. Just as a precaution I‚Äôm not installing 14.2 on my 12 Pro. Might just wait until 14.3 next month. Sorry can‚Äôt be of more help. Afraid I don‚Äôt know what the answer to this is. I ended up fortuitously getting a new phone around that time which solved things. And different people have suggested different solutions so I‚Äôm not even sure why that would be üòû Thanks for your reply.
Congrats on your new phone!

I‚Äòm on iOS 13.5 so the issue is not exclusively present on iOS 14. You might wanna wait for 14.3 anyways - better safe than sorry

Is it possible that you share the links to the posts you‚Äòre referring to? Via DM for example?

Thanks in advance and stay safe :) Ah ok, yeah think I‚Äôll wait any just to be safe. 

Here‚Äôs the MR thread - https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/notifications-suddenly-not-working-on-whatsapp.2265080/

Reddit won‚Äôt load older posts for me for some reason at the moment but the thread was posted in this subreddit in the last 10 days with a similar title so it shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult to find Thanks so much!

I looked into it and digged depper through other forums and stumbled upon some kind of workaround:

WhatsApp Business!
I downloaded it, ported the data from Regular to Business and now push notifications are working again.

Switching back to regular WhatsApp again breaks push though... so I‚Äòll use the business version while waiting for them to fix the damn issue.

I hope this approach comes in handy for some of you.

Stay save! :)

Source: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250814508 Good stuff! Good to hear there is a workaround.  What are the differences with WhatsApp business compared with regular? You CAN link your shop website, implement a catalogue with your products and set automated replies.

I‚Äòm using none of those features and well... it works.

**TL;DR: YouTube is producing invalid HTML with `<meta>` tags in the `<body>` instead of the `<head>`, and this is causing the WhatsApp link previews to not work properly for YouTube links.** Yeah some links work most dont I know that maybe just a glitch in the fw  i'll try a reflash Nope still not working on my device It only seems to affect yt on my device. I dont have an issue with web links. Nope still doing it sometimes. I can't believe they haven't pushed an update out what a joke. Could have to do with your connection, at the time of pasting the link in a request is sent and if that request is not fulfilled the link won't show up. You can try reloading the app and pasting it in a few more times to see if you can get it to generate but I agree it's not the best UI. It actually fixed for me but now its been messing up on my friends' phone who didn't encounter this problem before,so annoying maybe yt updated thier api or something? It has to be the youtube api i don't think they want people viewing it inside whatsapp. Instagram did the same.

I know this is probably a common question... 

But, I have a friend that chat with on Whatsapp who lives abroad. Yesterday, I sent him a message and I noticed that it has 1 checkmark, but I can see his profile picture? Have I been blocked, or has he been logged off his account? I can't see his recent activity status, but it just shows his profile picture and 1 checkmark.

Thank you very much!";2020-11-13 05:56:55;If you can see his profile picture he hasn't blocked you, he's just offline. Oh, okay... I read on the website FAQ that even if there is a profile picture and 1 checkmark that you could still be blocked, so I wasn't too sure... I blocked someone a few months back and my DP immediately vanished for that person and the FAQ said the same thing even back then. I just assumed they didn't update that FAQ.

I want to read the messages on it but I don't have the sim card anymore. Can I reregister whatsapp with my new number and still can see the old messages?;2020-11-12 22:39:18;"No you can't. Messages are stored on the client, so if they're still on the phone you should be able to see them.

If you get a new SIM card, you can go through the change number flow and still read the old messages.

However, you cannot register a new number on a new phone and still access your old messages -- this would defeat the purpose of encryption, etc.

Why do some videos send as a downloadable MP4 file, instead of showing the video?;18;jrp7ce;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/aeavu44b6gy51.jpg;20;;2020-11-10 20:26:56;"Sometimes people send photo's and videos as files, that way the quality stays the same, because when you send it as a video or photo, the quality is worse than it originally was and you only get a set limit on how long the video is that you can send, so sometimes you have to cut parts of the video out I think you have to click ""Attachments"" button and choose video i guess I dont know with whatsapp web but with you phone if you send it in the ""picture"" menu it will be sent as a viewable video and if you sen it as a simple file it will send it as a file like your picture Maybe try sending the video on your phone instead of WhatsApp web? Sometimes I've realised this happens to me too when I use WhatsApp on my computer. Maybe it just detects it as some other type of file intead of a video file? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This happens when the video file was recorded or downloaded in another format than MP4 and then converted to an MP4 file. The way I found to solve this is to open the mp4 file with any video editor and select ""Save as..."" then save as mp4 file, now try to send the new mp4 file that you saved and, Surprise! now it's sent as watchable video.

It's a problem with desktop codecs and formats, I guess. Thanks everyone for the help, it turns out that there are different types of MP4 files, I did not know that, using an online converter to turn the MP4 video to an MP4 video worked :) usually whenthis happens to me i send it to my own facebook chat, then download directly from there, then send the one i downloaded from facebook, it works...but yes junky... Its because yr uploading as document  Is there a way to send it as a watchable video, even if it worsens the quality?  
on google it says that the video limit it 16mb, this file is 14mb...

do I have to manually worsen the quality or make it smaller for it to be a watchable video? Still sends as a downloadable file instead of a watchable video I'm dragging the mp4 file into the chat, on most videos it sends it as a watchable video, but there are a few, like this one in the photo, that send as a downloadable file... Are you on IOS or Android? Have you tried swip & drop? Maybe it dkesnt support this type of mp4 encoding. There are different ways of encoding mp4. I think you simplu cannot at this time Android, I'm using my PC though, Whatsapp Web No, what's that? On android you just select
1. Attachment
2. Gallery 
And then you just select the photo or video you want to send if it's small enough
On whatapp web you can't send files from your computer, or at least I can't, but you can view it though whatsapp web if someone sent it to you ir if you have already sent it from your phone Not swip sorry drag & drop skdndndkd sorry for mistake, you have to drag your video in some chat. That's what I did, dragging and dropping or selecting the file uploads as the same thing, a downloadable video I think on PC it's always gonna be a file"

Therefore you never know wether the recepient automatically sends an unencypted copy to google or apple.
The claim that ""No one can read the messages"" is therefore false, unless both sides disable backups either apple or google or both can read the messages, the only one who cant, is whatsapp. 

For the same reason, the disappearing message is useless. It disappears for you, but not for google or apple.
What whatsapp would really need, is an option to opt-out from the backup. 
An option where my chats arent included in automatic backups of other people."

Even if I'm using my normal number on iOS? Perfect thanks! Did that work for you? Curious cuz I'm about to be in the same boat. yeah it worked, Android phone has old messages on, iPhone started afresh. just had to set up my old WhatsApp with a different number and then backup from my Google account"

Earlier, it used to show total messages shared, total size of media shared etc as part of Storage Used feature of Settings. Now, it's only showing the media (photo, video, doc etc) that was shared. Count of messages seems to have vanished... Am I missing something?";2020-11-09 06:29:28;Yeah! I'm missing that badly already. It's a shame they removed that feature (apparently). Let's hope they bring that back cuz I need that feature so badly. I just tried it and its still there- I scrolled to the bottom and clicked on storage usage and it all came up for me. Did anyone figure out how to view total messages sent per contact or Group? I can't find this info in What's App iOS.

I know its only 0.99 pence, but never forget.

Still feeling silly.



How can i get my money back from what‚Äôs app?

Need advice please.

Thanks.";2020-11-09 04:43:41;"The refund period is probably long over. Like, really long over. You can't get it back now. https://discord.gg/gGHxvyp84H refund discord Why did you purchase the app if you didn't think it was worth 99p? They didn‚Äôt refund, you could also pay ¬£5 for a lifetime subscription when you renewed . I did and then days later they announced it was going free. At the time the refund window was two hours. I contacted them and they said NO. So, I ended up paying ¬£5 for about a weeks service. 

It‚Äôs not a biggee but still occasionally causes me slight irritation all these years later. What a way to treat early adopters. Its not fair:( Fuel/petrol prices were way cheaper in 2010, we should get a refund for all the extra we've paid since then.  

Life isn't fair.  Suck it up princess.  If all you have to worry about is 0.99 pence, you have a pretty good life. It is. At the time it was 1 doll for a year and then Facebook bought whatsapp and removed the yearly subscription fee. You paid for a year which is over and they shouldn't reimburse you.

[microphone](https://ibb.co/5vZzLXH) Disable voice typing in gboard Thanks for your reply but didn't work as i still get the ding tone You should not see the microphone icon itself when you disable it. 

Go to gboard settings > voice typing and disable it. 

Then the icon itself should disappear no chances of accidental touches. Ok, thats not what i want

I still want to use the microphone to send voice messages...but it plays a loud ding tone when i start recording and stop recording Oh ok. Sorry i think i assumed wrong. 

I don't think there is any way to disable the sound. If your phone is on sound mode it will make that ding noise on accidental touches. Ok but thats very loud regardless of my ringtone volume Because it depends on your media volume. You'll have to keep that low to avoid getting such loud dings. It was already off

https://ibb.co/fdLQsFX Interesting because on my pixel 2xl if my media volume is low the ding becomes low. Maybe explore the vibration and haptics option. That might help you."

Use two factor authentication on Instagram. Change your password and don't share it with anyone. But Im so confused? How would they even send my Insta messages to my Dad?

Meaning your data is kept in your phone's cache, you can save to cloud (restore only once upon re-install) but if you lose the file when restoring (my phone crashed once in that process 5gb file) you will lose everything.  In the other hand, if you backed them up somewhere manually you might still be able to read them.  I have 2015 conversations when I used to have a Windows phone, if I remember correctly, there was an ""export chat"" feature that, I don't think is available anymore.  I exported lots of chats this way and sent them to my friend for safekeeping.  Of course, I still have them, but NO thanks to WhatsApp.  I don't even think the export chat feature is available anymore.  Windows Phone sure isn't :(

PS other chat clients do save chats in their servers: Facebook Messenger and Telegram (my 2 cents!).  Good luck! Thanks for reply :) I think I will try to get old phone running again and see if there's backup file"

At least I thought so. All went perfectly until I was told it was a success, at which point I ejected my iPhone where it went into a bootloop and I can't get it out. I don't want to lose my messages but also worried to undergo the six hour process again...

Does anyone have any advice?";2020-11-07 21:53:27;"Same here :-( Having the same issue... <.<

**UPDATE:**

Backuptrans's support team tell me to try another time, because other customers successfully transferred the messages after another try. u/lacrimal- u/Backflip_Frontflip How did you resolve the boot loop? I am considering purchasing it too. Thanks Damnit.. I spent 2 hours copying over my SMS messages from Android.. and then did this Backuptrans Whatsapp transfer.  Everything showed working.  I disconnected and rebooted my phone.. and now... BOOTLOOP. I tried two times, both 14.1 and 14.2, and both enter bootloop and have to restore. I've emailed support for advice, if there's no solution I'll ask for refund. I'm considering trying other apps too. This app worked perfectly to me. I switched today from a pixel 3 xl and I was able to transfer all my WhatsApp history without problems. Just for reference: They released two updates meanwhile and the process is working without any issues again. Hey, im having the same issue. Have you resolved it? Just have to enter DFU mode while plugged into a computer for iTunes. Same here! Same issue, terrible PITA. Now again spending multiple hours to set my phone up from scratch and WhatsApp messages still missing. I will request a refund as well. I wiped and did it again and it worked! Hey! I actually started the process again (wiped the phone and restored from my android again) and it worked perfectly, with my pictures and everything. Just took a bit of stress and a lot of time switching debugging on and off Having the same issue. Going through the process to restore my iPhone at the moment. Thanks! did you retry the transfer after you restored from backup and got the WhatsApp messages transferred? I am having the same issue. I am very very tensed right now.
Can anyone please walk me through the process of restoring the phone back.

Its ok if i don't get my data back. Just give me detailed walkthrough of solving the bootloop. I really really appreciate the help. I did not. I am getting a new number anyways, so i've decided to leave the whatsapp chat history behind for now. I did get a refund for the product though after asking for one. Look up instructions for restore mode. It‚Äôs pretty easy Thanks! Got it bro, did the restore and solved. 

Thanks alot Sorry, I haven't logged into reddit on my new phone! It did work for me on the second go so I wish you luck Thank you! I am having the same issue. I am very very tensed right now.

She got back in thankfully Next morning it worked Why do you think there is a support team huh? They know people do this kinda stuff. We can get back our acnt Nope... I'm on Public Build...

He can only see the groups you joined from your account. That too without names. He can't access your chats or anything personal private stuff. All he can see is which groups you are in. And, support team won't take days. They will reply you within hrs. They are pretending to be my mom and contacting everyone in her contact list asking for help. And asking to zelle money to an account. It‚Äôs kinda easy to notice that it‚Äôs a scam. But my mom has a lot of older friends who I‚Äôm afraid are falling for it [removed] That's awful. How exactly are they asking for money? Bank transfer or what? **Hello.**

I'm facing an issue with WhatsApp on iPhone. The application does not¬†find any backup to restore from after I completed a restore of my iPhone as a new device. When I install WhatsApp on my new phone, it says that it does not find any backup to restore.

I have tried to do all of the following:

* I checked that a backup existed in Whatsapp and in iCloud drive¬†before¬†restoring my phone
* I checked that I have 2.05 times the space needed on iCloud Drive
* I checked that I'm using the same phone number and iCloud account
* I checked that a backup existed in iCloud Drive on my new phone
* I tried to delete my WhatsApp backup and did one again
* I have signed out of iCloud, turned my phone off, signed back into iCloud
* I have tried to reset my network settings

* I have checked that all of my devices are using iOS 9 or later

All of the solutions above do not solve my issue.¬†WhatsApp is still unable to find any backup after I restore my phone.

Has anyone faced a similar issue and managed to solve it? Any help would be amazing :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ps: I have tried contacting the WhatsApp support but they have been useless so far and keeping me in a loop for the past two weeks.

Ps: I'm not sure if this is connected but I've noticed that the app behaves strangely. During a manual backup, the upload process jumps from a low size to a high one in a split second (i.e.: 220.8MB to 7.91GB) which seems very odd. This happens every time.";2020-11-07 11:58:14;"Hi, I‚Äôm facing the exact same issue. Even with the strange upload jump. I will report back here if I find a solution. Did you make any progress in the last few days? Thanks in advance

Edit: Fixed it by just trying again and again. I think waiting untill my full iCloud account by charging the new phone fixed it in the end. Also the phone was plugged in while the restoring option became available. I also made sure the old iPhone and the new one had the same name. i don‚Äôt know either also having the same issue it‚Äôs really frustrating! will report back if i have an answer UPDATE: I managed to back up my WhatsApp and restore it on my new phone. I'm not sure what fixed it in the end but here is what I did:

1. Deleted my iPhone iCloud backup and my WhatsApp backup (in iCloud Drive)
2. Turned off iPhone Backup and WhatsApp backup
3. Made my WhatsApp backup  smaller by deleting big videos and files. They recently added a new feature where you can manage all your media.
4. Waited a week
5. Turned back my iPhone iCloud backup and my WhatsApp backup
6. Did the whole backup + restore as a new phone process and it worked :)

Hope this helps some of you!"

transferring from android to iphone, i'm afraid i lost all of my data, but hoping that there is a way to access it still;1;jpced8;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jpced8/transferring_from_android_to_iphone_im_afraid_i/;0;" my number was ported from the android to my iphone, disconnecting the android from the internet.  i downloaded whatsapp on the iphone and it asked me to login and i did.  it texted me a verification message, i confirmed.  no data in there except two new unread messages.   i opened whatsapp on my android, all old messages were still there.  i connected my android to the internet and it instantly logged me out and stated something along the lines that my account was logged into a new device, and if it was me.  before i confirmed/denied, i somehow lost sight of that screen in my confusion and fear of losing data.  i wanted to say that it wasn't me, but never made that choice.  i was at a regular login screen.     

&#x200B;

i had no warning that i may lose my data, and had no real reason to think i was at risk of losing data, other than my own ignorance.  i would have thought upon logging into a new device that i would be prompted of possible data loss if that was the case.  i didn't realize that whatsapp was stored completely locally until doing some research online after fearing my data loss.  i also learned about backing up to google drive and doing the transfer that way, but i am afraid that i'm too far along the process of losing data for that step.     

&#x200B;

there is a small chance that i turned on google drive backup long ago within whatsapp, but i don't know if i did for sure, or which of my several google accounts i would have used or if the google account attached to my android was used as a default.  i have looked a bit in a couple of my google accounts, but i don't know where to look to see if there is a whatsapp backup.  (currently looking from a desktop through a browser, but can look from android/iphone app as well)     

&#x200B;

i feel that all of my data is likely still in the whatsapp app data, locked away from my access when i was auto-logged out of whatsapp.  i'm afraid logging back into my android whatsapp app and verifying with the text message sent to my iphone will yield nothing but emptiness on my android and probably overwrite the appdata there.     

&#x200B;

i understand i didn't follow the proper backup procedures.  i didn't think that simply logging in on a new device would nuke everything on my old device, but i fear that is the case.     

&#x200B;

so i guess the real questions are: where inside google drive can i look to see if i have a whatsapp backup?  are there any other places on the android app that i may have turned on archiving/syncing?  is there any way to access my data on my android phone after being logged out?   

&#x200B;

tldr:  i transferred my phone number from an android phone to an iphone, logged into whatsapp on my iphone, and instantly got auto-logged out of whatsapp on my android and am afraid i lost all of my data on my android, and am trying to regain access to the android whatsapp data.  i don't know if i had any kind of archiving/syncing enabled or how to look at this point and am afraid that logging back into my whatsapp on android will wipe the app data clean.";2020-11-06 23:09:18;

Trump (Leading)

Yet, when I try to post this as a WhatsApp status, I get the warning of *exceeding 700 characters*. If I ignore it and post the status anyway, the last lines of the status get trimmed out at the end.

Someone exports chat of person A and sends it to person B  and then deletes the message ( .txt file) from the conversation with person B ( chooses option delete for me)

Whatsapp doesn't Load from backup;1;jnduqw;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jnduqw/whatsapp_doesnt_load_from_backup/;0;"So after resetting my phone to factory settings, I've been encountering some issues on whatsapp. 

Whatsapp can't load from my backup. I'm pretty sure I had backup, or at least that it was set to be done automatically every week/month.

Only the ones I have since the day of resetting my phone to factory settings.

I have a Motorola Moto G5 plus. For some reason it has been crashing lately. Screen freezes so I have to hard restart the phone. Not sure if this is relevan to my problem, but just putting it out there.

Whatsapp Desktop Problem - Not Opening 2nd Time After Closing?;9;jn8lzy;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jn8lzy/whatsapp_desktop_problem_not_opening_2nd_time/;9;"This was just recent, but it started to happen yesterday (Mon, Nov 1).

Never had any problems with Whatsapp Desktop but after opening and closing it initially, it stopped opening the second round. Not sure what the case or if anyone else has this sudden issue? I've tried the following methods but still no luck in solving the problem completely:

**Method 1**: Task Manager > Finding Whatsapp Desktop background process > End tasks.

* This would briefly solve the issue and allow to open it, but once closed you would need to do the same again. Which is totally inconvenient and time consuming.

**Method 2**: Uninstall & installing back.

* This doesn't solve the issue as well, once installed, opening at first is alright but once whatsapp desktop is closed it would not open the second time.

Hoping to find a solution to this problem.";2020-11-03 14:23:22;"https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jm18kv/windows_desktop_version_wont_terminate/ Whatsapp acknowledged the issue to me, saying they were working on a fix.  No ETA. Same problem here, I hope they solve this quick cause its really annoying. It's happening to me as well since a few days. Awful, but at least there's a workaround. Hope they fix it soon. Well, whilst we wait for a Whatsapp Desktop update... my alternate solution at the moment is to revert back to Whatsapp Web Browser instead.

Haven't used it in a while, but at least it gets the job done for the time being. This is happening to me too! XO This is happening to me, and this time it's not opening and there's nothing in task manager >.< Just an update guys, after waiting a couple of days...

So, when i start my PC whats app will load fine ( from the windows store ) but when i close it and then go to re-open it, nothing happens it just seems stuck.

Then when i terminate the app through app settings, it says ""the current call will be terminated""

I have tried reinstalling, resetting, i am not sure how to fix this.";2020-11-03 09:41:06;"Same issue, had it for a few days now. Probably a bug connected with a recent update.

I am using the x64 Windows version directly downloaded from [whatsapp.com](https://whatsapp.com), not from Windows Store. For me it just keeps active in task manager and I have to force close it to be able to open it again. Same issue. Thought it was just me Same issue here, you need to kill the app from taskmanager for now.

\---- Edit ---

You can use this batch to start whatsapp from any location:

`@ECHO OFF`

`TASKKILL /IM WhatsApp.exe /F`

`START %UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Whatsapp\Whatsapp.exe`

`EXIT` Same issueüò≠. Had to open WhatsApp on the browser If you are using windows create a .bat file with the below script:

`TASKKILL /IM WhatsApp.exe /F`

`cd ""whatsapp_directory""`

`start WhatsApp`

&#x200B;

Just replace whatsapp\_directory with the path where whatsapp is located in your system.

This will kill the existing program and will launch the whatsapp for you.

&#x200B;

Lets hope whatsapp fixes it soon. Same, both the store version and the version downloaded from the site at least we know its not just us This. Exactly this. Luckily I made a .bat script to kill and restart WhatsApp The same happens with the whatsapp downloaded from the store. thank god someone else has it, i thought it was me to and something was funky with my whatsapp Tried it out now, works just fine. I just placed the .bat directly into the WhatsApp program folder - it's at C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\WhatsApp if you've got the standard desktop version installed - which allows to omit the `cd` command, so my bat looks like this:

`TASKKILL /IM WhatsApp.exe /F`

`WhatsApp.exe`

Made a shortcut to said bat, gave it the WhatsApp program icon, done. Should've searched reddit first! Wasted a lot of time trying to fix the issue. Tell me more Can you enlighten us, who are less wise in the ways of science? Yup, me too did the same.. Well, I just search for the PID (process ID) of WhatsApp and killed them. Then I ran WhatsApp. What we want is for you to post the contents of the bat Ooh I like this. Straightforward. I'll do it tommorow morning, it's almost midnight here make a .bat file and execute if before opening the app, command is:

taskkill /F /IM whatsapp.exe and add start """" <path to wa.exe>"

There is no official way to solve this.

1. According to [https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-in-a-final-stage-of-testing-for-the-multiple-devices-feature/](https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-in-a-final-stage-of-testing-for-the-multiple-devices-feature/) whatsapp is currently working on the multi platform sync feature. You might want to enroll via the beta program and eventually have this solved
2. As far as I can tell, the only software that promises to solve this problem is : [https://www.backuptrans.com/](https://www.backuptrans.com/) , I have however no insight on how and what they do with your data etc.  -> [https://www.backuptrans.com/android-whatsapp-to-iphone-transfer.html](https://www.backuptrans.com/android-whatsapp-to-iphone-transfer.html) read here for more.

&#x200B;

For me it means I am still unsure whether I will actually try enrolling for whatsapp beta or just swallow the pill and live without my old whatsapp messages... I am on the Android beta channel and I have not seen it."

I tried doing the same thing re-installed twice but still same issue it is so frustrating Last night it was updated to 2.2043.2**2** and the issue ceased.

My Nokia 6.1 Android phone died suddenly 2 weeks ago (completely dead - can't even boot to recovery - definitely can't access any files from the internal memory). It had years' worth of Whatsapp messages. Google backup was on and from what I can see there is a backup (dated the day my phone died) on my Google Drive.

I bought a new phone online, but until it arrives, I am using a very old Android phone. When I installed Whatsapp on it, I never got the option to restore my old messages (old version of Android?), so messages just start from 2 weeks ago.

(I haven't enabled Google backup on my temporary old phone, so it doesn't overwrite any of the backups from my dead phone.)

When I get my new phone, will I be able to restore my years' worth of Whatsapp messages from my Google Drive and also merge the last 2-3 weeks messages from my temporary phone?

I am certain having used it with some zoomed out settings for years that the text size is now different and out of proportion with some of the other text on the screen. 

For example messages size compared to the 'last online' text size is sooo different, the last online is miniscule to the point of invisibility to achieve the messages text size that I had previously. It's driving me crazy!

I wondered why this has happened or what settings I must have changed?";2020-11-01 21:33:30;"Press ctrl+0. It resets your zoom setting if you've changed it accidentally. Then you can adjust it as required. For some reason mine got messed up as well. While everything else seems fine, the text font size looks too big. It‚Äôs more that the zoom options appear to affect the different text separately, like some text gets very small zooming out, some doesn‚Äôt? Does that make sense? It‚Äôs really strange! The web app is fine so I‚Äôm mostly just using that, if that helps - but I‚Äôm yet to understand why it happened in the first place ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Unfortunately, I can't understand. I use browser version and not the installed one. It looks good on my end. Sorry. ‚òπÔ∏è Thanks for the tip! Guess I'll stick with WhatsApp web for some time to see if they fix the Windows app.

Last week I sent them an email explaining what happened and they asked for screenshots, as if it was too hard to understand without a picture. No, thanks, I'm not gonna send them my chats."

Windows desktop version won't terminate;29;jm18kv;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jm18kv/windows_desktop_version_wont_terminate/;34;After desktop version silently auto-updated itself... the new latest version 2.2043.21 apparently won't terminate itself when you close it. It will stay in the background process and prevent you from launching another one. The one that stayed in the background cannot be called up anyway with hot keys or task manager. I have to manually terminate every single background process until there're no traces left before I can restart whatsapp desktop. This is getting old man. They keep letting this bug creep into the desktop version.;2020-11-01 15:10:29;"Thank god, I thought I was the only idiot facing this. Was about to reinstall my windows. Exact same thing happening to me.

&#x200B;

Also, terminate the one using the highest amount of memory, it will close all others. I thought I was the only one. It's really annoying because I have to go to Process Lasso and manually end the process to be able to reopen it again later. I have the same problem, it started from one minute to the next. Tried reinstalling already which didn't help. Glad I'm not the only one. I've contacted support too, I'll let you know if they get back to me. Yeah, it's infuriating. Tough luck if we accidentally close the desktop app.   
They should just revert to a previous version, while in the meantime they figure out what's going on. I wasted a lot of time trying to debug this thing before I came across your post; I thought the problem was from my side. That WhatsApp.exe just seems invincible, it remains in AppData/Local after uninstalling. Tried unistalling whatsapp from control panel, and removing registry entries I could find it still remained. With 3rd party unistaller the uninstall was clean, but the problem persisted after fresh installation. (In the process I even uninstalled McAfee out of frustration)

Are the earlier versions that can be found on some other websites like [https://whatsapp-desktop.en.uptodown.com/windows/versions](https://whatsapp-desktop.en.uptodown.com/windows/versions) safe to use? Can I stop auto updating of WhatsApp? I'm having the same issue Yes I've been experiencing this too since yesterday. Annoying the hell out of me. I have the same issue with Version 2.2043.21. Same here, for the last two days or so. Was there an update or something?

I've already reinstalled the app about 2 dozen times, cleared all cache folders, even tried the MS Store version, same thing. I was facing the same problem and the simple fix (we can do for now) is to end the processes and then launch it again.  
But that was getting very tedious.  


So I created a small batch script that just has the two command lines to kill the processes and run WhatsApp again.  


Just paste these 2 lines into notepad and save it as a .bat file like ""WhatsApp.bat""

`taskkill /im whatsapp.exe /f`

`""%localappdata%/WhatsApp/WhatsApp.exe""`

This will open WhatsApp whenever executed. Has anybody found a solution? Try This Solution.  


1. Check your windows Version if it is 64bit  download whatsapp desktop 64 bit version.
2. uninstall the whatsapp on your computer.
3. Then go to C:\\Users\\......\\AppData\\Local\\ and delete whatsapp folder
4. Install downloaded 64bit as administrator (right click on setup and choose ""run as administrator"".
5. Done.  


Just check is it fixed or not.  
Thank You. Me too.  Tried to roll back to an earlier version, but their installer ""helped me out"" by substituting the most recent (broken) version. Update released. Problem solved. Yeah.  I reverted a restore point, to no avail of course. I've been going back and forth with the support and showed the problem with a video yet they still have no freaking clue what problem I am having. I told them repeatedly you can't reload/rerun whatsapp after I close it, due to the processes running in the background. You have to manually terminate them first. This only happen with the recent version that auto-updated today. They still have no clue and can't understand what I am trying to say. Microsoft Store version groups the processes into a single entry. 

It's easier to close FB/whatsapp are typical arrogant tech companies that will never admit their mistakes. They won't even budge on the ugly new fb ui despite users complaining. These tech corp have too much politics within them to deliver results even if the results are undesireable. >taskkill /im whatsapp.exe /f  
>  
>""%localappdata%/WhatsApp/WhatsApp.exe""

Thanks man. Works like a charm. >WhatsApp.bat

Thank you. I've been having this issue as well. Your temporary solution helped and works perfect. Hopefully WhatsApp pushes an update soon to fix this annoying bug Same here. Please let us know if they managed to understand what's happening. I just came here to post the exact same issue and found out that it's not just me. apparently the issue got solved already They just know a lot of people don't have other options as there are no quick replacement. Agreed, seems like they are more concerned of preventing people to use the old layout than actually trying to improve the new layout.  
Their idea of the layout is that it works better for them, it objectively works better for everyone. Regardless of what users think.  
Can see why WhatsApp is being like this, after all it's owned by FB. >24 

Ditto. BTW, they have already pushed a patch in the Microsoft Store version. They got back to me. Here's the reply


""Hi,

Thanks for your message.

Sorry for the inconvenience. We are aware of the issue and we are working on fixing it in a future update of WhatsApp. Unfortunately, we can't comment on any future release dates at this time.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us. We'll be happy to help!"" Meh, I switched from WhatsApp to Telegram as my main messaging app a while ago and I'm loving it. It's easy to replace since Telegram has all the same features and extra ones on top. Thanks, how can we find out if WhatsApp has an update on their website for Windows install? Does Whatsapp auto update or do we need to manually check their website? So nice of them. Telegram is anyway superior, but you can't take your whole network with you. I guess, it auto-updates by default"

I've looked around for advice and she has tried the following with no success

- She has tried restarting the phone
- She has made sure she has latest Whatsapp updates 
- She has tried listening to it like a phone call with the phone up to her ear to activate the other speaker

So none of these have worked and I've been unable to find a similar problem while looking around and am just hoping against hope that someone on her can be of assistance

Also Dr.Fone installed a alternative WhatsApp on my Android because I can download the official one on Play Store. Will it do this on my iPhone too? Because surely that means I'd be running an unsupported WhatsApp which won't get updates. Defeats the whole point of transferring over. Before the transfer No with this method you can upgrade whatsapp normally Is that on the iPhone? Because I currently have two versions of WhatsApp on my android after using Dr.fone to backup.

I cant transfer across to iPhone for another 12hrs because of the activation lock out I don't know, i used wonder mobile transfer, followed the guided process of the software and it worked for me"

EDIT2: Found an old version here: whatsapp-desktop.en.uptodown.com/windows/download Works fine on 7, though no idea if it will auto-update later on or how to stop it from doing so if it does. Also this whole thing honestly pisses me off, because they basically bricked Whatsapp on 7 *yet old versions still work just fine, so it's not like they created a major update that couldn't possibly work with 7, since I can message people just fine on this older version!*

I hope it's just an accident that Whatsapp doesn't work on 7 anymore, but the fact they removed it from the main website tells me they probably knew it didn't work on 7 anymore and just updated everyone even if they knew it would break the program for some. I wouldn't be so angry if old versions didn't work, because of some intrinsic property of the update that only works with new computers but no, old versions work just fine so why not leave a download link on the website for an old version that never updates or something? This is just a simple chat program and the old version works just fine, I can connect and chat with friends fine and even see media, so it makes no sense why a new update would just stop working when a version back worked and *still works  today when you install it!*

So I really hope they fix this because if not and if this starts auto-updating for me back to the newest version I'll probably just find some other chat program to use.

EDIT3: I think I may have fixed the auto-update thing by setting the folder to ""read-only"" in properties. Whatsapp consistently worked through a few restarts that way. Just go to Windows 10 honestly, way better. technically u r right... but to me... I prefere the standalone app rather then webchat. A tab doesnt feel right for whatsapp. hey... my older version asked me to update whatsapp this morning. clicked and its working alright now. latest version. This isn't what yashifique was asking about. How about no? It isn't ""way better"". This isn't like a decade or two ago when new versions of windows brought a ton of extra features because of technology still evolving fast, right now I can literally do all I ever need, play all the games I want, etc, etc all in Windows 7 and if I switch to 10... I won't get anything new that I couldn't already do in 7. 

The only main difference is the aesthetic, which I fucking hate in 10, since it feels so blocky and clunky and like it wasn't made by an actual human, instead being made by an AI or something. Nothing flows or anything and my experience using it has always been worse than 7, since there is nothing to outweigh the HUGE negative of the aesthetic, since that is the main difference between 7 and 10 and the main difference you feel in everyday use. It's like telling me to use a worse looking and feeling car because ""oh well it can connect over bluetooth to your phone!"" when that is such a small feature and something I will never use, and isn't enough to outweigh all the other negatives of switching over. (and I get that 7 isn't updated anymore, but I visit way less sketchy sites than I ever have in the past, and even then I never got viruses or anything, so I'm pretty sure I'll be safe)

tl;dr W10 isn't ""way better"" since the main differentiator between it and 7 is aesthetics only and 10 has way worse aesthetics and it just feels more clunky and worse to use. (though if you like 10 more because of those reasons, because you like 10's aesthetics over 7, then fine, that's great! but that's you and it doesn't mean it's objectively ""way better"" since the main differences is aesthetics which is subjective. The only way I'd say to use 10 over 7 even if you hate the aesthetics is if your a complete newbie to PC's so you don't know how to easily avoid getting viruses) 

And like Soup said, this doesn't even answer the question anyway. (I know my rant doesn't either, but I had to give my 2 cents oof) My Dell Inspiron 15R 5520 cant run windows 10 because of drivers. Dell doesnt provide drivers for windows 10. Windows 7 isn't even getting security updates and other updates so good luck with that. I would rather use linux Oh, as if those security updates were such an essential thing! 

Duh... Hmm I hear leaked NSA exploits in my ear."

Keyboard shortcuts for WhatsApp for Windows desktop

If you‚Äôve installed the WhatsApp app on your Windows 10/8/7 desktop, you might find the following keyboard shortcuts very useful.

Start new chat Ctrl+N

Create a new group Ctrl+Shift+N

Open Profile Status Ctrl+P 

Undo Ctrl+Z 

Redo Ctrl+Shift+Z 

Cut Ctrl+X 

Copy Ctrl+C 

Paste Ctrl+V 

Select all Ctrl+A 

Search Ctrl+F

 Zoom in Ctrl+Shift+= 

Actual size Ctrl+0 

Zoom outCtrl+- 

Next chat Ctrl+Shift+\] 

Previous chat Ctrl+Shift+\[

Archive cha tCtrl+E 

Mute Ctrl+Shift+M 

Delete chat Ctrl+Backspace 

Mark as unread Ctrl+Shift+U 

Close Alt+F4 Hey mate, I was annoyed as well that they completely removed Ctrl+Tab, so I made an Autohotkey script to solve this. 

	#NoEnv  ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
	SendMode Input  ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
	SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.

	#if WinActive(""ahk_exe WhatsApp.exe"")
	var := 0

	CoordMode, Mouse, Client
	SetDefaultMouseSpeed, 0 ;

	~^*$Tab::
		if (var == false) {
			var := true
			MouseGetPos, xpos, ypos 
			MouseClick, Left, 9,82
			MouseMove, xpos, ypos
			Send {Tab}
			Sleep, 50
			Send {Tab}
			
			if GetKeyState(""Shift"", ""P"") 
				Send, {Up}
			else
				Send, {Down}
			
			return
		}
		
		if GetKeyState(""Shift"", ""P"") 
			Send, {Up}
		else
			Send, {Down}
		
		return

	~LCtrl up::
		if (var == true) 
			Send {Enter}
		var := false
		return
	#if
	

As always, I urge any AHK guru that sees this to please improve upon my code, but I've been testing it and so far it hasn't failed ^^^that ^^^much . The only point of failure is during the sleep. 

Since there's not a single place between the conversation list in which you can position your pointer and click without changing to another conversation, I had to instead ""click"" right above it (in the search bar.

Then, pressing Tab will activate the search bar and doing it again would focus the cursor on your current conversation. But doing it too fast (as in AHK-fast) results in only one of the Tabs being registered and the cursor staying in the search bar. 

That's why the ""Sleep, 50"" is there. It ensures the search bar is activated before pressing Tab again. I noticed, though, that depending on my CPU load the time requirement would be lower or higher. If you try the script and it gets stuck in the search bar, I'd recommend giving it some more time (in milliseconds), but not so much that it feels slow.

Ight, imma go ahead and shamelessly page every other person that replied to your post expressing some kind of frustration.

Edit: It's back to normal shieeeet I liked the old ones :( I don't like ctrl+1 ctrl+2, etc Yup, that's what I mean well, for me the archive chat isn't working. any luck there? This was useful af, but now I need to use two hands to switch windows. This update fucked everything up Mark as unread not working for me :cry Thought I was going mad when the shortcuts stopped working. Why would they change from an almost universal ctrl+tab to using \[ and \] keys?! That's an awesome idea! Although, when trying to run it, I get ""Erro: Unable to parse line 3"", something with SetWorkingDir.

Is there a special configuration for autohotkey I need to use? I send a email asking if there's any way to roll back and then i keep you updated That's weird. The first three lines are put there by default when you create a new AHK script, so I just left them there.

You could try deleting that line, since the script doesn't work with any file or folder. 

I don't know if it has anything to do, but perhaps you're running an older version of AHK that doesn't support the command? That's the only explanation that comes to my mind. That's amazing! Thank you :D Cheers. What a stupid fucking update.  
I can't believe they changed good shortcuts and added new ones.  
At least give us an option??? I have a prior version downloaded that I tried to install, but it auto updates :( I do have a hope that this is a bug for this version only, but ever since has not been updated. I guess that we can only wait and hope to be fixed. you can archive a conversation? Ctrl + E to archive right? No I'm able not to on the latest WhatsApp version for Windows"

What is the best service (preferably free) I can use where I can get a US number to use for What's App, and then, when I am back in the US for good, I can port this same US number to a real contracted phone number (like a T Mobile, for example).

Just choose one and stick to that. I'd be best if you don't lose it though in case you need to get an SMS to that number some day. nice yeah i know.  but i don't have a steady number.  that is the problem.  and if someone else gets a number from a previous sim card, they can boot me from what's app.  this has happened before when i had a malaysian number for 2 years.  the sim card company in malaysia gave the number to someone else and i lost that.  luckily i had an icloud backup so i didn't lose most of my messages, but i had to contact everyone again to let them know to delete the other number.  

it's a pain but i guess i'll just find a permanent US number and then transfer it once i'm back in the states long term"

I always do them manually. Emojis are cut off on the bottom, the text box doesn't grow bigger when you add them and the send button doesn't work until you press in the textbox. Super annoying. Not sure if it's Whatsapp or OnePlus or Android's problem. Happening since you updated to Android 11? So it's an Android 11 bug? Sigh, I just hope it's happening to enough people that it's fixed soon. Going to try uninstalling and reinstalling Whatsapp now. Emojis are not working correctly, they aren't being registered by the textbox so the textbox doesn't get larger when you add them and the ""send"" arrow doesn't show up (as seen in my screenshot) Report this to whatsapp support Well I don't know for sure if it's a Android 11 bug, WhatsApp beta bug or GBoard beta bug. Yes I see. All you need to do is add the emoji as you have and then hit the back button to minimise the keyboard and the send button will appear. I have. I think it's an issue with GBoard probably, the keyboard I'm using I'm using SwiftKey and non-Beta WhatsApp but am running Android 11 so looks like it's the latter... Yep but it worked fine before, they need to fix it so you don't have to do that :) It's not an issue with Gboard. It must be either Whatsapp or OxygenOS 11 or Android 11 When did it start?

Whatsapp not backing up at 2am anymore;3;jjmh47;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jjmh47/whatsapp_not_backing_up_at_2am_anymore/;4;I have my Whatsapp set to back up daily and it would usually do this automatically between 2am and 4am.

Is anyone else having this issue?;2020-10-28 15:05:24;"What is the battery capacity level when the backup fails on days between 2am and 4am?

I have personally observed in my case when battery capacity is less than 30%, backup fails unless my phone is on charger and battery capacity in excess of 50% Above 62% should be fine for successful backup that is configured  for daily backup. 

I don't why daily backup failed when battery capacity was above 50%. 

Have you checked your device perhaps if Whatsapp is not in sleeping mode? Some days its below 30% so I guess that was the reason then. But this morning it was 62% and it didn't start backing up until actually opened the app. Yep I checked to see if it was in sleep mode and it wasn't.  I guess ill try charging just before bed tonight to see what happens this time. If that doesn't help then I guess an Uninstall and reinstall is the next step."

I wanted to know if the ""**Online**"" text you see below a contact's name mean that they have you in their list.

I am NOT talking about ""Last seen"", I'm talking about ""Online"".

Does it still show to you if they deleted you **without blocking you?** Or is that an info displayed only if both of you have **each other** in their contact list?";2020-10-28 13:34:22;"It is not linked. You can see status from anyone. Even from people that deleted you? Because you're not supposed to see that someone is Online if they don't have you in their list. You can talk to someone even if he / she is not in your contact list. 

How you do it:

\- You can share your link to WhatsApp.

\- I can access your WhatsApp and I do not add you to my contact list. I start a conversation with you.

\- I just have your number. I do not have your contact in my contact list. 

\- I will see your status.

Let me know if this helps."

Recently changed my number when I moved over to a new iPhone (long story but wanted a new number)

I followed the instructions on the WhatsApp website but I seem to be having an issue. Here is what I did...

iPhone 1 with original number, backed up via iCloud.
iPhone 1, changed number via the settings menu. 

iPhone 2, downloaded WhatsApp
iPhone 2, signed in and registered with new number. All chats restored and media restored etc. 

Now, I have just text a friend and despite him adding my new number into my contact card on his phone (he got the notification I had changed numbers) I have come through in WhatsApp as a new chat but the same name. On my side though it's all in the same thread. 

Have I done something wrong or what's happened. Ideally I'd like it all to be in the same thread on both sides.

2. Go to iPhone -> Setting -> Whatsapp -> Notifications -> Show Previews = Never It does seem to work though I no longer have privacy lol Turn the message preview off in the WhatsApp so that it would only show the contact name and not the whole msg üòÉ"

It is really sad that there are still so many restrictions in iOS on this. 

iOS really needs to allow users to add customs tones without having to buy them or having to use GarageBand. And those tones should be accessible in the whole system. Really annoying! Unfortunately, you can only set the notification tone within the Whatsapp app itself - and Watsapp have only offered us the standard iOS tones. 

You can‚Äôt use custom tones for whatsapp :( Sorry for the late reply. I'm on the same boat as OP. Have a bunch of purchased alert tones and want to use them in Whatsapp.

Is this an iOS limitation or has Whatsapp just been very slow to implement this feature? I believe it‚Äôs controlled by the app only, as there is no feature in iOS to change the tone... but I‚Äôm not at all an expert so could be wrong."

2. Is there a way that I can back-up my whatsappp chat history from google drive somewhere safe so that in the future if I move back to Android or if I need to retrieve some old chat, I can just enable whatsapp on an android device and have access to it?

2. You can even transfer you chats and media of WhatsApp onto your pc. Just connect your android to a pc with a cable and copy and paste everything of WhatsApp. This will be a backup of whatsapp Thanks for the revert. Even after connecting the android to pc, not able to extract the backup.

Coming back to the uber question, if a year down the line if I decide to move back to Android would whatsapp be able to retrieve this backup? The backup from android yes, the one from ios I don't know. Not for free atleast Thanks! Appreciate it"

WhatsApp as SMS?;2;jg6n0i;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jg6n0i/whatsapp_as_sms/;4; I'm a touch confused -- I've friends & people I follow who are in Europe and based on what they say, WhatsApp is the go-to messaging server and completely replaces SMS. How is this a possibility when SMS is completely different than Messaging? What am I missing?;2020-10-22 22:28:44;Where is a difference between sms and WhatsApp? It's both a way to chat with one another. No one cares if it uses data or sms everyone already has a data plan. Unless one is low-income. I have a data plan right now, but I'm low-income. I got the freebie lifeline phone from Assurance Wireless so that if at any point I'm unable to afford my Tmobile data plan, I'll still have access to a working phone. Just trying to figure the best way to utilize messaging / apps to get the most out of the smaller data plan granted the lifeline users. Looks like you're from the states. Over here in europe most cheap phone plans don't include a sms flat. They're more likely to give you more data than free sms. That's just because most people don't use sms anymore and use WhatsApp instead. But you shouldn't have a problem with using whatsapp with a small data plan. If you don't plan to use it for sending a lot of media all the time, it practically doesn't use any data at all. That clears it up. Thanks so much.

Many new [android phones](https://www.android.com/intl/en_in/) are coming, including Samsung Galaxy S30, OnePlus 8T, and more. The best thing is that Android smartphones are getting better day by day, and some iOS users would love to buy them.

I'm in a different country, couldn't top up, so the number expired and the provider I'm guessing sold it to someone else. I'm guessing that person used it to register with whatsapp. Today when I opened my whatsapp, I see a pop-up message which reads... 

***Your phone number is no longer registered on this phone. This might be because you registered it on another phone.*** 

***If you didn't do this, verify your phone number to log back in to your account***

I don't want to lose all my conversations. What can I do?";2020-10-19 03:23:53;"Give up and change number. That number does not belong to you, and you lose all means to get it back.

Oh by the way, you had ample time to transfer all your chats and data to the new number, but you didn't do so. If you backed up all your conversations to the cloud then yes you'll have them all. I had to change my number when I got a new phone and couldn't verify my old number (which is inactive). Backed up my conversations on the old phone, registered on new phone with new number and restored from cloud. This, you should have changed number of your account :/ I can change number no problem, but will my chats be there? When you get the pop up message, do you tap on the ""verify"" or ""OK""? 

You can try uninstalling WhatsApp and reinstalling, and if somehow WhatsApp asks to restore the data found on your phone, you're in luck.

Otherwise, you're screwed. Do not uninstall I really can't remember anymore. What does the pop-up say? 
***Your phone number is no longer registered on this phone. This might be because you registered it on another phone.*** 

***If you didn't do this, verify your phone number to log back in to your account*** I can't remember sorry. Try to verify with a new number and see if it works. If not, then say OK and verify with new number. I remember it being relatively straightforward"

Whatsapp Backup Issues;2;jdfyt9;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jdfyt9/whatsapp_backup_issues/;5;"Hi all

&#x200B;

I've tried searching and can't seem to find a resolution so hoping a fresh post prompts a reply!

&#x200B;

My huawei p30 pro mate backs up to google drive every evening. I've had this set by default. I went to the shops today, opened whatsapp and it said there was an issue and to restore messages. I clicked the 0200 backup which got to 44% hangs, then says it can't restore from that backup and to try an ""older backup"". What it then selects is a backup made at 0431 this morning (instead of 0200 this morning). 

&#x200B;

When doing that backup, it literally sits on ""restoring messages"" for as long as it wants and never loads up the backup. If i cancel it out it loads the chats but not actual messages dating back to last year. 

  
I've gone into google drive and can see the backup from 0431. I've located all the chats within my phones whatapp files so they're all sat on my phone but i can't ""load them"" into whatsapp.

&#x200B;

Can anyone offer any advice on how to get a back up loaded from like the last couple of days?";2020-10-18 16:02:35;"Hello me to have same problem, do you fix it? I found a solution,

&#x200B;

1-Firstly download that app and extract key file

[https://github.com/MarcoG3/WhatsDump](https://github.com/MarcoG3/WhatsDump)

&#x200B;

2- Use that tool for decrypting your messages and photos

[https://github.com/B16f00t/whapa](https://github.com/B16f00t/whapa)

&#x200B;

when you decrypted you retrive your all messages and photos like this:

Also you can use it for create new backup

Whatsapp doubt - Please need help - urgent;1;jdetz4;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jdetz4/whatsapp_doubt_please_need_help_urgent/;10;"So, all these years i used Whatsapp on my Dubai number. Moved to india only for 3 months; got a sim card indian number and also ran ( a seperate )  whatsapp on it ( the indian number too; using parallel space- multi account )   Now I lost my Dubai job and am leaving Dubai forever. My sim card and number wont be vaild anymore. So I need to change my dubai whatsapp number to the indian one.

Now, the Dubai number whatsapp has all the imp chats. I don't need the indian number chats at all.

So how do i transfer dubai number whatsapp to indian number whatsapp ( both which are running seperate whatsapp accounts ) ?

My thinking / Solution :

\-Delete the Indian number whastapp account.

\- change number of dubai whatsapp account to that of indian number.

But my question is will this ( above ) work ? or is there anything that i need to know of ?";2020-10-18 14:35:20;just do the thing Yes, your steps are correct. You need to delete your Indian number account. You'll lose the chats in that account. Take screenshots of whatever you need. Then go to Dubai number account and change your number to Indian number. All your chats and data will be unaffected. Yeah, what you described should work just fine. It might require a bit of time after you delete the account to reassign a new one to that number, though, but the data will be transferred easily for sure. i just want to be safe and ask if that would be fine because I cant afford to loose all my dubai number whatsapp data. So i would like to know if those steps are right and if my data would be safe. this is incorrect. if you do this in the new whatsapp update you will lose all your data, whatsapp has even said this in the update notes. this is incorrect. if you do this in the new whatsapp update you will lose all your data, whatsapp has even said this in the update notes. you have to do the thing and it will be safe Really? Damn, this worked for years, just swapping the number in the settings. so what do i do then ? any idea ? you have to call up WhatsApp and they will guide yiu through the process

Let me know if that helps. Thank you for the quick answer. I revised my questions. I hope that makes more sense. I think the answer to the second question is no, you have to call any Whatsapp user via Whatsapp. You could try facetime if the other end also has an Iphone.

Hope an update soon fixes it. Annoying. Well at least I'm not crazy.  Wish I could figure out how to solve it Pixel 3.

Where I would have days of the not connecting unless I unlock issue, seems last couple of days or so... no issue. odd. wondering maybe a whatsapp update fixed issue??  i did see an update go through a couple of days ago. Also I was fiddling with Samsung power management settings... not allowing it to power manage apps determined not to be used much. Maybe that's an 11 feature? I've had this problem intermitently for three years or so, across multiple phones and computers, and I never found a solution. Now you mention it, you're right. Haven't noticed the problem in a couple days.  Maybe it's solved!"
Bulk Importing contacts for broadcasts;1;jcepze;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jcepze/bulk_importing_contacts_for_broadcasts/;2;"Hi all,

I'm working for a client that wants me to import over 100 contacts into their WhatsApp account so they can send out broadcasts. 

The problem is I'm across an ocean and they don't want to manually enter the contact information they have. 

Does anyone know away to bulk import contacts as broadcasts? Or a way for me to remote access their account?

I'm afraid I know the answer already, but thought I would ask here. Thanks!";2020-10-16 20:57:16;"Maybe you can make a .vcf contact file if you can code / script. Open that on the phone and then use the broadcast function in Whatsapp. Hi I did this video for you.

Get WhatsApp Messages without verification;1;jcemm7;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jcemm7/get_whatsapp_messages_without_verification/;4;"Hi all,

Bit of a strange situation I'm in, my partners mother died recently, a friend of hers has decided to challenge her will stating she left everything to her, it emerged the friend of hers who was supposed to be taking care of her was actually stealing from her....(bank statements were reviewed) long story short a note in one of the mothers diaries stated that whatsapp messages would clear up the will.

One of my partners sisters has her mothers phone but after a recent update whatsapp is asking for sms verification, the awkward thing here is that the ""friend"" was able to get the phone number deactivated 2 days after her death...sub human but I won't go there.

So is there a way to get into whatsapp and ""by-pass"" the authentication? Or can the files be copied onto a PC and transferred to another phone or viewed?

TLDR - read the last paragraph 

Thanks all, appreciate any kind of help. Based in the UK if that makes a difference";2020-10-16 20:52:21;"There's still WhatsApp folder in the phone. Back up files in that folder. Also there could be back up on Google drive. Try these options. Otherwise, once sms authentication is active, you have to go through it.

Another way is to involve the police. They might have a way. Thanks gaugar, I was thinking of using android studio. Damn update screwed it but all failing that it will likely be a call to the police I really hope it all sort out properly. Good luck. Thanks man, it's a messed up situation."

I have an iphone 6s and suddenly, out of nowhere whatsapp deleted all my stickers, including the ones in favorite. I did nothing different than i do every day.

Why did it happened and how can i get them back? i tried upgrading the app but that didnt work. Thank you";2020-10-16 18:04:20;Probably because the stickers are no longer licensed by Facebook and so it‚Äôs removed. And what does that mean? Exactly what I said.

Why would you use WhatsApp instead of Telegram?;1;jbzcpi;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jbzcpi/why_would_you_use_whatsapp_instead_of_telegram/;4;I mean for me Telegram is way better, what about you?;2020-10-16 03:06:25;"In my opinion the UNIQUE reason is everyone has it, fortunately it‚Äôs changing recently and lot of people are joining Telegram. 
Many others have Telegram but don‚Äôt know reason to stay, don‚Äôt know about self-destructing messages, images, multi-device, multiple accounts in same device, color themes for everyone, scheduling, editing messages, a LONG SO ON. I think it‚Äôs much about not knowing all the magic and powerful things it has compared to... that Facebook app The thing about telegram that I don't like, is that I can't delete individual stuff of from groups I'm on. Its either clear the entire chat, or leave it all on.
Where as in WhatsApp, I can delete what I don't like or need, that others posted on group. Until telegram makes this option available, I'm preferring WhatsApp.
As far as I'm concerned the only thing telegram has going for it's self, is that it can handle way more ppl on a group, WhatsApp is limited to 256 ppl on a group You can't 'find' them, you have to be added to them by the administrators of said groups, ask your friends... Where do I find whatsapp group chats?"

I hope this makes it more clear.

If I zoom out far enough, the right most scrollbar disappears and the screen fits on the page again. But this was never the case and I don't want to zoom out a webpage as it makes things less readable. It's just that the 100% scale doesn't seem to fit anymore. Yes, I just saw that. I think it has something to do with your screen resolution. have you already checked that? It's still set to be 1920 by 1080 as it always has. Maybe some Windows update messed up the scaling?"

Whatsapp with more than 15k contacts super slow. App issue or low tier cellphone?;11;jaltx2;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/jaltx2/whatsapp_with_more_than_15k_contacts_super_slow/;14;"Hi all, I have a Moto G7 Power (64gb ROM, 4GB RAM).

I know it's a low budget phone, but for Whatsapp and social media it's way more than enough.

The problem that I have is that I use this phone for my business and I have over 15k contacts and Whatsapp is SUPER slow. Just opening takes about 5-10 seconds. Updating a status will take about a minute. Sending a message will take 2-3 seconds just to appear in the chat screen.So, my question is... would a high tier cellphone will fix my issues or is this just the way Whatsapp behaves with that much contacts/chats?";2020-10-13 23:33:52;"If you are using it for business purpose especially you have 15K contacts (which is a lot by any measure) for a single app to handle, you can maybe justify investing a bit more money than a low end phone pointed out by yourself. I am sure your business can help fund a phone more expensive than Moto G7 Power. At least you can figure out if it‚Äôs the phone or something else Are you using your phone to spam ? Try WhatsApp web, maybe it will be easier. Buy new phone goddammit I dont think 15k contacts its A LOT (like non manageable).For example, how does a big company offer whatsapp support? Maybe they dont save the contact of every customer, but I bet they would have thousands of chats hanging around whatsapp.Even whatsapp web is not an option as it takes like 5 minutes to connect to the phone.Switching to another crossed my mind, but people just want to use whatsapp because is what everybody uses. No, I sell to the entire country. People contact me generally The big companies that offer WhatsApp support that exist but it doesn‚Äôt mean they communicate to these customers through the same phone device. They have maybe bots and a team of customer care professionals to manage all these enquiries. I‚Äôd have thousands of chats then at least they have tens or hundreds of people working on them. They offer support through WhatsApp because it‚Äôs the way customers prefer not the other way around. You don‚Äôt have to think 15K is a lot which I am going to debate here. The reality and fact is your phone is struggling to handle that volume. I have nothing against your phone. If you don‚Äôt try something else, you‚Äôd probably be going to get the same results. Good luck mate why do you need to save each contact?

edit: and yeah, 15k is A LOT. I do not save them all. I have way more non registered chats. I speak with 100-200 people a day. 
I might seem a lot, but is a business that I started few years ago and WhatsApp/social networking is the best way to sell.
From time to time I delete all chats just to make it a little smoother, but that's not a solution. buy a better phone then, if u're running a bussines and u are using it all day I see no reason to stay on a budget phone Does WhatsApp web o PC run slowly also ?

15K contacts seems a lot but they are not so heavy generally speaking. I think even a stupid game is more demanding on hardware and software resources Yes, you are right.

I will do so Exactly my thoughts. 15k seems a lot but... come on, this app is just a CHAT... how much hardware would it take? That's why I had my doubts about spending above $700 in a new cellphone.

But in the other hand... if I cannot improve Whatsapp, at least I can improve the hardware. are u using whatsapp bussiness btw or just regular one?"

I tried for days. Every time I requested a new verification code, the time I had to wait increased every time. Last time, it was 49 hours. Luckily, I fixed and did not wait so much.

&#x200B;

I tried lots of time but i will tell what i did for latest try.

&#x200B;

Firstly, I deleted drive backup. I did not disable sycn or google accounts. 

&#x200B;

I had 2 local backups. Deleted one. 

&#x200B;

And maybe those are important: I gave all permissions from settings to whatsapp. I gave also autostart permission and I gave no battery restriction.

&#x200B;

Sim card is on different phone. This is not important i think.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I started to restore. It restored local backup. When it came to %24, i was worried. So, I switched to screens once a second, to settings screen.

&#x200B;

Normally it was showing 3.9 gb at first. But when it reached %24, it was 3.18 gb when I was switching to settings screen, i saw it. And 2.5 millions messages are restored and it is 3.18 gb.

&#x200B;

I waited it to be 3.9 gb when it was at %24. So that is why i was switching to check but it did not stuck this time. Maybe because i was switching. 

&#x200B;

Maybe because i removed from drive. This was the first time i tried after removing from drive.

&#x200B;

So, switching a lot of times between settings of whatsapp and restoring screen, showed succesfull screen at last. IT said ""restored 2.5 millions messaged""

&#x200B;

I was shocked. I went to check. 5 days ago, i wrote last message and that 5 days messages also came.

&#x200B;

If it was stuck again, i would force stop and continue without waiting restore. I read it from somewhere. But i fixed, i am happy :)"

Why don't you test it with a friend and double check? If he blocks them, they will not be able to see his last seen, online status, written status or profile picture. So blocking is the way to go then right? Well they probably will notice that his profile picture vanished (If he had one).

- Set both single and group messages on silent from Android's own notification settings. It keeps resetting to normal, however? And every message still vibrates?

- if I sign-in with the iPhone what would happen with the Android content?

Is it possible to backup on an external hard drive?;9;j8i7nk;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/j8i7nk/is_it_possible_to_backup_on_an_external_hard_drive/;7;"Hello fellow Whatsapp users. I'm not sure if this is possible, but i just want to confirm.

Currently, I have 29gb of Whatsapp data, which I've been accumulating since 2015 and migrating from one iphone to another. As of now, it's already quite difficult to back it all up on iCloud ‚Äî the backup never seems to be able to complete. I'm relying solely on my phone's internal memory, and well, having nearly 30gb of whatsapp takes quite a toll on that.

I'd like to know if there is a way to preserve those messages outside my phone, maybe in a compiled file on a hard drive, akin to how you can save Photo libraries on mac.

Ideally, it should also be possible to view the messages and media stored locally on a desktop  environment, without the need to be connected to my whatsapp account. That way I could delete them all from my phone and free up a lot of space.

I have no idea if such a system actually exists, but I don't find it impossible.

(before anyone suggests cleaning some messages, this is after two big revisions in which i deleted entire groups full of media ‚Äî this is jest the amount of messages I've accumulated from 5 years worth of chat with family, friends, etc., lmao i know its a lot)

if anyone can point me towards that way or something like it i'd much appreciate it, thanks.";2020-10-10 13:26:37;I don't think it's possible because everything is encrypted + it's harder with an iphone I think it would be way better if WhatsApp just saves all of your stuff on their servers/cloud, just like Telegram does.

some time ago I was able to download a conversation and save it with media as a zip on my pc.

Can media be exported too?


Thanks in advance!";2020-10-10 00:00:32;"On the phone when you click on a chat and tap the person's name, scroll down and you can see export chat. It asks you if you'd like to include media. Then choose to e-mail, upload to Google Drive and stuff. but this is only limited to 40k messages, if you want all of them you need something like whatsapp viewer, transfer encrypted databases + key, decrypt, view I am sorry I should‚Äòve included some information about the OS and App version:

WA 2.20.102
iOS 14.0.1

When I follow your suggested path, I can only see [OS language is German so it‚Äôs translated by me]: 
Clear Chat
Block contact 
Report contact

Did they removed that option on iOS but kept it on Android?


Thanks for the answer! Hm, Googling shows me [this answer](https://www.syncios.com/images/article/export-whatsapp-chat.jpg), does this work? Unfortunately not. Add, Mute, Clear, Delete. And no export.

The export function is still working under android? I don't know. I'm using an iPhone 6, but its latest iOS version is 12, so maybe something's different in 14, the one you're using. Darn. Using the 6s. Yeah, maybe you‚Äôre right and it is not working for this version. Could you check your WhatsApp version, please? Unfortunately I can't charge my phone right now, so can't turn it on.

How to only see whatsapp notifications from a certain person at certain times?;2;j7ve5z;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/j7ve5z/how_to_only_see_whatsapp_notifications_from_a/;1;Hi everyone - i'm wondering if it's possible to hide notifications from a certain person on whatsapp between certain hours. Like having someone on mute but scheduled times - and mute isn't exactly perfect because when they message you, you can see it immediately just from going into the whatsapp home screen. I've tried using archive as well but when they message it just pops back into the home screen again. Ideally they would stay in archive and i'd have to go and look for the chat to message them, except for a few hours a day where i'd just receive notifications as normal and their chat would 'pop back' into the main screen. Even just being able to keep them in the archive regardless of whether they message would be good. I know it sounds like a demanding request but if anyone has suggestions to achieve a similar effect i'm all ears! Otherwise i'll just have to get a second phone hahah;2020-10-09 11:40:32;They're developing a feature to keep chats in archive but it's not available yet

How to Bridge a whatsapp call with a telephone call via zoom;2;j7rljs;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/j7rljs/how_to_bridge_a_whatsapp_call_with_a_telephone/;0;"I just wanted to put this out here in the ether in case someone needs it in the future.  I recently have been trying to get in touch with a client who can only communicate via Whatsapp calls but I needed to get in touch with the client with an interpreter.  My office has some interpreters we work with on a regular basis, but they were all unavailable.  We subscribe to a separate service that offers on-demand interpreters via telephone, but this service doesn't do Whatsapp calls, just standard telephone calls.  So the question was how do I call this client via Whatsapp using a telephone interpreter?

The solution I came up with involves two computers, I'll call them the Host computer and the Client computer.

On the Host computer, set up a zoom room/meeting.

On the Client computer, you'll need a few pieces of software:

First, an android emulator.  LDPlayer is what worked as it lets you pick your speaker and microphone sources.  I tried Bluestacks (wouldn't work because Hyper-V was being a pain) and NoxPlayer (doesn't let you pick a microphone).  Get the emulator set up and install Whatsapp.  I'll note that there was a Google Play Services error when I tried to verify my Whatsapp account.  If you go into the Google Play Services permissions and turn the SMS permission off then back on, that seems to fix it.

Once that is set up, you'll want to install Audio cable and pay for the audio cable A+B pack (you need two virtual audio cables).  Audio cable is a software that lets you use the audio output of one app as the input of another.  Once you install audio cable and audio cable A, you'll now have new speaker and microphone sources that you can use to bridge the android emulator with Zoom.

Join the zoom from the Client computer and use computer audio.  On the Client computer on Zoom set the audio cable as the speakers and set audio cable A as the microphone.  Then in the android emulator sound settings, set them as the opposite: Audio cable as the microphone and audio cable A as the speakers.

Boom, now you can call someone on Whatsapp from the emulator and the audio will be routed to/from the Zoom call so you can call an interpreter into the zoom call using the phone dial in option.

You can do this with just one computer if you dial in with another telephone, but in my case the Host computer is where I use a VOIP program to make work calls so that's why I needed a second computer";2020-10-09 06:16:07;

I am a Chinese user of WhatsApp and a foreign trade practitioner. Heavy WhatsApp user.

I am using an openwrt router with a built-in SSR proxy.

When using the iPhone to connect to the WiFi of the router, the WhatsApp in the iPhone can be used normally, and any files such as messages and pictures can be sent and received normally. Everything is normal.

When you scan the QR code with your iPhone and log in to the desktop version or [web.WhatsApp.com](https://web.WhatsApp.com) on your computer, WhatsApp can log in to the computer normally and can send and receive text messages normally, but it cannot receive or send media messages such as pictures.

Try to solve the problem: I added to the blacklist of proxy rules in my router SSR

[web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com)

[whatsapp.com](https://whatsapp.com)

But it seems that the desktop version of WhatsApp is bypassing the proxy. But it does not completely bypass the proxy, and text messages can be sent and received. Failed to send and receive media files such as pictures.

Here's how to make your own Animated Whatsapp stickers without any third-party apps (Android);42;j79pmz;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/j79pmz/heres_how_to_make_your_own_animated_whatsapp/;21;"I've been looking all over Reddit for posts on how to make animated WhatsApp stickers. Barely a few provided help and those which did mention downloading some keyboards or apps. 

So after learning from other sources and trying it myself, I decided to create a post for others who come around looking for the same.

Steps

1. Get someone to send you a few random non-animated stickers. Try making sure these are unique and aren't regularly used.
2. Find a gif you want to create to a sticker. The ones with transparent background look cooler and are available on [Giphy](https://giphy.com) under stickers.
3. Copy the link or download the image.
4. Open [Ezgif](https://ezgif.com) and click on resize. Animated gif resizer comes up where you can paste your link or upload your file.
5. The next webpage that opens, enter the dimension 512 in both height and width boxes. Make sure the resize method is gifscale. Click resize. You can change the aspect ratios to select the best preview because there might be some cropping involved while resizing.
6. The preview of the resized image appears in the lower part of the webpage. Here's the catch. The no of frames will be visible. A respectable 4-6 can be a good sticker, up to 12-16 can be possible with sticker flickering a bit. Beyond that your call if you wanna try.
7. Press the convert button and choose webp (Whatsapp sticker format).
8. GIf to webp converter webpage opens up. You can directly press the convert button and save the preview that appears in the lower page. Or you can tweak the webp image using the tools at the top part of the webpage and then save it.
9. Copy the sticker to your phone in the Whatsapp Stickers folder. Usually, the directory structure to locate it is Root>Whatsapp>Media>Whatsapp Stickers
10. Sort the stickers by Modified Descending. 
11. Remember that random sticker? (Step 1)
12. Copy its name, delete the random sticker and replace the name of the ezgif sticker with the copied one.
13. Go to settings>Apps>Whatsapp. Clear its cache and force stop it.
14. Voila, when you reopen that chat with the random sticker, in its place lies the animated sticker. Save it in favourites and spread it like wildfire.

Video link for the same: [Youtube (Not my channel)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC-caLyHZtc)";2020-10-08 11:58:39;"It is sad that we have to come down to this method just to get animated stickers. WhatsApp's implementation of animated sticker is shitty.

Great job OP. The GIPHY stickers when taken to WhatsApp turn into a GIF. It doesn't remain a sticker. What do I do? yeah... it works but only in my phone... the one who receives it can only see the original one... which is weird... in my conversation there is an animated sticker and in another is a different sticker just adding more info to it... tried a 96 frame sticker and didnt work, whatsapp didnt let me share it with other people... reduced it to 71 and the same sticker works... so there is a cap number between 71 and 96 frames I am guessing for sharing Thanks a lot man. Worked like a charm, but for some reason had to try with some stickers that just wouldn't work (not even default ones).

Some custom ones work, others don't. The best way around this is to have one of your friends (to whom you are not going to send your own animated stickers) send you a BUNCH of custom stickers to use as ""raw material"". And make sure the rest of your friends (whom you're targeting the custom sticker) don't have them beforehand. Thanks a lot man! You're at step 2 or 3. Refer the steps after it. True. At the instance of renaming, both sides end up seeing different stickers. 
However, you save the sticker in your favourites. Then you proceed to send the sticker back to them. As far as I checked, the new sticker is then reflected properly in both the phones/accounts. Really? Because I did that, it still doesnt work Can you try with another sticker? Make sure to clear the cache and stop the app in the other phone as well? I just cleared the cache in the other phone but still didnt work... And I sent another time but the same animated sticker I made, which is in favorites... If had to that in every phone I send a sticker would be bad so I am glad that this isnt a solution hahaha but will try another one... Is it possible to send you my WhatsApp number if it is the case? To test it? Thanks for the help so far You know I've been testing with my friends and family's phone. We've been merrily enjoying the stickers. This issue hasn't cropped up so far. I'm not sure what's the issue. 

About the exchange of numbers, I apologise I can't. However, I'll surely get to the bottom of this and reply to this comment. Totally understand of course... I just wanted to eliminate the possibility of being your phone having something that makes it work and the problem is not the way I did it you know? But no worries, it is common sense not give phone numbers randomly hahaha it is just a curious situation tried another one and still didnt work... put the file after converting it, changed the name, cleared whatsapp cache and forced stop it... and again I can see it working perfectly in my phone, I add it to favorites as you said but when I send it in any of the 2 phones I am testing it appears the sticker that shouldnt even exist anymore hahaha that is the weirdest thing duuuuuude... I think I found out hahaha it is because the stickers my friend sent me are those that we can get in whatsapp by default... you know what I mean? you can download them direct on whatsapp... I was using those ones.... I have a GUESS based only in deduction that maybe, because it is a default whatsapp sticker, it has some specific id on it and whatsapp will read it as one of its own no matter what... when I used a ""foreign"" sticker it work as a charm in the first try... so there you have it, thanks for the help and sorry for the intrusion by exchange phone numbers hahaha but I get really into solving these things Whoa! Never thought about that. I never used default whatsapp stickers. Always used custom ones. I just tried with a random custom sticker from a friend and it still doesn't work I would say to try with another random custom sticker because maybe the one u tried wanst actually custom? And didnt work how btw? Didnt transform in your cellphone or it works in yours but it doesnt when u send it? What is the problem? The One I tried was custom because my friend made it.
I tried replacing it in the sticker folder with mine and renaming it.
After all cleaning cache and stopping app I saw the new sticker in my phone but the other saw the old one. Also trying to remove as favourite and adding it again would add the old one If he made it maybe in his phone it is seem as default sticker just like the ones default from whatsapp? I am completely guessing here... I would try send to another person or have someone download a custom sticker pack from an app and have it send it to me (what I did and works fine)"

two checks: sent and delivered to the recipient

two checks, blue: the recipient opened the conversation to read that message

you may disable the read functionality in settings; you won't see a blue check for these users who have disabled it. So how can it be one check combined with two blue checks ??? Am I missing something ? The menu you're seeing is basically saying the message has not yet been delivered nor read. Once it is, you'll see the three points being replaced by a timestamp."

New phone, and the usernames for non-contacts are not showing up.

This is--*NOT*, numbers instead of contacts are showing up in my WhatsApp.  

It is NOT that issue.  I've troubleshooted that issue anyway, but to no avail.  

What I'm speaking to, is:  

I was added to a number of groups.  There are dozens if not almost a hundred people that are not in my contacts--however--their username still appeared in a chat,  on the right side of their message.  

So on the left side of their messages was their phone number.  

And the on the right side of their messages was their username.  

I got a new phone, and now those usernames on the right side of their messages are not appearing.  

I really do not want to go around and add nearly 100 numbers.

My girlfriend reset her Iphone, everything was backed up - when reinstating whatsapp, her messages were from 2017!;2;j56hgx;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/j56hgx/my_girlfriend_reset_her_iphone_everything_was/;3;"My girlfriend bought a new IPhone last year in October (I can't remember what model it is, but it's the one with the three lenses on the back!). Her battery was going prematurely and needed charging a lot, so Apple instructed her to reset everything (factory reset), and then redownload from ICloud.
Considering she did this last year and got all her stuff, and more importantly her Whatsapp chat history, was all up to date.

She reset today, and then got everything back from ICloud, but her whatsapp history was from 2017 at the latest - BUT her photos were up to date?

We're both a bit sad as while I have all our chat history, she does not! Does the fact she just found out she has all her photos (a huge amount), she has a chance to recover the others? She has 50GB ICloud, or maybe more.

Hey, I have the same issue except in this scenario I am the girlfriend helping my boyfriend (lol). He is upgrading to my old iphone, which was wiped of my accounts. On his old iphone we backed up everything to icloud as well as the whatsapp chat history within the app. Then we logged into his icloud on the new phone and restored from a backup. We deleted whatsapp from the old iphone. Then when opening whatsapp on the new phone, go through the verificiation process and the conversation history is strange. Group messages are from August 2020, but the most recent individual message is from 2019.

When we switch back to the old iphone on whatsapp all the messages are there still so it's not lost forever. It also still says the last chat backup was Sunday. Do you have any idea how we can see the conversation history on the new iphone (considering it's already backed up to the same icloud account)? Maybe there is some sort of glitch with whatsapp?

\*He does not have the autodownload function with whatsapp so no photos. Yes they were done through WhatsApp! I told her to restart and then resync and her messages have now been recovered.

As I was working on my laptop, I decided to use the desktop application yesterday. We had to make a change within 1 hour, so everybody was working full throttle. As the deadline was approaching, ( The time of 1 hour was about to end) the photos in the WhatsApp group started to increase, the navigation in the desktop application was becoming difficult. I switched to the android app.

To my surprise, absolutely none of the photos had been downloaded on the app. As per my knowledge, whatever auto-download settings are applied to the mobile app, are also followed by the desktop application. But that didn't happen. 

I've checked all my settings and everything seems to be fine. All permissions have been granted. There is no data usage check applied. But still, the auto-download feature didn't work on my phone yesterday, while it did flawlessly on the desktop application.

I just texted a person yesterday, I know her but we are in different countries and the message is still one grey tick so i'm wondering is it because she didnt get the like ""notification"" of my message idk man...";2020-10-03 18:41:41;"One tick means the message 'left'. Two ticks means the message 'arrived'. So she hasn't received it yet. Also, there's nothing, if a stranger messages you through WhatsApp it just pops on top like any message but of course it's coming from a number you don't have. And the app advices you to also be careful because you don't have that person in your contact list. That's it.
Also, if someone blocks you, you'll always see a single grey ticket in any message you send. The messages will never ever arrive. Great! 

She can't block me because she never got my number, she doesnt even know that i have her phone number so it should be fine. I will just wait till two ticks. So, why she still didnt get it, is because she hasnt internet connections or her phone is turned off, right? Okay, i just got something in my mind... 

When you type a number in Whatsapp and it says ""the number is a user"" or something like this, does it still says it when they have deleted the app? If not, then she hasnt deleted the app because when i typed her number in it says that it is a user. Yes. If she uninstalled the app I assume it'd work the same way but I'm not sure. I don't really know, but it could be that there are WhatsApp numbers that are corporative and it says so - like 'this is a business' rather than a person. Yeah, could be the same, you are right.

I'm having issues with WA notifications under Android 11.

First of all the channels organization is super weird;

* Every separate chat has its own channel compatible with the new Conversation feature (Conversation section), **but duplicated** (one normal and one ""Silent""). For some contacts I even have 2 silent channels, wtf ?
* Then you have the Message and Group channels that also **somehow impact the Conversation channels** (Chats section), which **causes** my **issue** (see below)
* The Silent Notifications channel (Other section)
* And other channels that don't cause issues and I don't care about

**My issue** is that for some groups I set the conversation channels (normal+silent) to silent, yet they still ring. My assumption is that it's because the general Group channel is set to Default (it rings).

My questions: First **why is there a Silent notification duplicate for every conversation**, second **how can they have channels that impact other**, 3rd **how to fix my problem** in the middle of all this mess ?

Are they gonna fix it ?

In 3 years? still no option that muted chats do not shop up at top or stay in archive... and whats about the ui update? always feature is for lifetime means forever until you manually unmute that user. That was called holiday mode. And was removed from beta and has probably been scraped and going to be redone. I meant when the feature will be released. Like multi-device, it has like one year on beta. WhatsApp is so funny i know im just mad that they‚Äôve cut it out. currently it is in beta phase for testing. after that it will release for all user on Android and iPhone. May be it will available within 1-2 weeks. You think, haha. Let‚Äôs hope in no more than 2-3 years :) When a feature is available in beta it's usually only a few weeks before public release. The 2-3 years is usually only when first announced by WABetaInfo/other bloggers. If by weeks you mean 4+ or months then yes. 

There have been many many features that take months to move to non-beta WA. 

It's not always but more often than not that way. Your statement makes it sound like WA-beta features land on non-beta quickly, which is categorically incorrect."

But if someone buys your number, you willl at some point lose your account.

For example, if someone else has your number and you get a new phone, you can't migrate your WA to it since WA sends you a SMS verification to the phone number. The other guy would get that verification, not you.

So, the new owner can't get your WA as long as you have two-step verification. But you will lose it once you need to re-verify your account since there is no longer a number to verify with."

How Does it have to be any random people or just the people we know, ie., the people who we know and have our number saved on to their phone? Exactly bro, I did the same and they unbanned my account. I am so happy that I got all my chats and school groups back. i was getting impatient and I emailed them with different accounts and they would have thought like ""f unban him or he won't stop emailing"" haha, sorry just i am so happy Mass reporting (asking friends to do it or just using several accounts of your own), probably. WhatsApp doesn't really check this, just bans people automatically sometimes. Any.

Edit: why would random people have your number, unless you're member of a group, consist of strangers. Anyway, I don't judge people. You read my mind. Someone in a group who is a snowflake can do much more damage that you can imagine, especially in situations like this. Although I don't consider such 'damage' as damage. You know what I mean.

Not like they put it on mute for no reason. And then once one person does it, everyone starts doing it when they feel their message is important or super funny. That‚Äôs how you get people to leave or block you. Sometimes you're in a small group of 5-10 friends and need to say something important that you don't want to get lost in the many messages. It's a close circle in friends. Occasionally we need to mention each other to play some online game. That's not the point... Sometimes you **need** a large group of people to see something.

I.e.: The past two days we had 2 professors who had to change the time of their classes. They warned us via google chat and whatsapp respectively.

I had to make sure everyone got the message, because some people, like me, keep all of their groups in 'mute' because I don't want messages all the time. And I simply like helping.

Even tho I mentioned everyone, one by one (29 and 42ppl respectively), some people still missed it, and they  'arrived' at the online meeting late.

This functionality  could have saved me like 5 minutes, for a very large group I don't think is viable to tag one by one, that's why I googled it and ended up here. **Telegram has it.**"

There's an easy fix if you have the endless crashes: Go into Settings -> WhatsApp (Business) -> Allow access to photos -> None. 

Then open WhatsApp (Business). And now the app should open like it usually does. You can now set the setting back btw.

I could have sworn that there used to be a feature in whatsapp that let you add stickers (not just the preset stupid looking emoji ones) to a photo before sending it.... I used to create custom stickers and add them to photos  but now there's just no option it seems?  Am I misremembering this feature??

My memory is that you'd tap the paperclip icon, select photo, and then open a photo and tap on the smiley face icon at the top and then there were two sections. the preset smileys (which are a total mess, like why are there some sper cartoonish emojis here and then some that look straight from iOS?)  , and then you'd slide over and see all your own custom and downloaded stickers ?

Thanks";2020-09-28 22:27:11;"What do you mean by ‚Äúthe app goes to low?‚Äù I got the same problem nearly a month. I checked the Task Manager and CPU reach the 100% usage suddenly when open the image or video. I mean it becomes low, for example if I open the image and immediately close it and try to type something, the text time to appear and after 10 secs. the app becomes fluent again 
Srry for the bad english p.s.  It's totally fine when I'm using Whatsapp Web"

I'm not sure if the backups will work from Android to iOS, though, but that's a different matter. If your app constantly backups automatically, the unread messages backup as well. If you are switching from an Android to iPhone, the backup will not transfer. If you ever backed up WhatsApp on iOS before, you will get that backup instead. Yes. All messages including unread messages  will be backed up."

I am not able to work it out somehow. Your help will be appreciated. It‚Äôs all wrote on repository Or just the comment before this Is there any another bot for animated stickers? Making stickers by normal way is painful :'( Also, hope you'll add support for [Tenor](https://tenor.com/) gifs too. How though? It's organized in a weird way Excuse me? xD Still working? it's still working? I can't remember that i have installed node module or not , but let try installing on with your terminal watch any youtube tutorial then after installing that

Download that github file of stickerbot

Extract it on specific folder

After that open terminal 

Change directory to that to that stickerbot folder by 
cd pathofstickerbotfolder

Or alternatively you can open terminal in that folder

Then write command

npm -i

npm install gify-cli -g

Wait for installation

node index.js

Here you will see qr code open click on WhatsApp web on your mobile and scan that qr code 

See there will be output server started

Now your mobile is stickerbot , send gif or images to your number's WhatsApp by anothers WhatsApp 
Stickerbot will now convert gif to webp and send this to senders WhatsApp Actually is working just send from WhatsApp search gif bar Not as organized as your mama

I don't know how to use recovery software on iOS so I don't really have any specific advice either No icloud backups either?

Not sure how you expect to recover them without any kind of backup.

I doubt there is any kind of consumer software available to ‚Äúundelete‚Äù it seeing how locked down the ios filesystem is. 

Maybe there are some companies that can do that but even if there is, your best bet would probably be to stop using your phone to make sure it does not get overwritten. Sorry but it seems you can't get back your chats unless you have a backup. I guess it's too late for that. Oh well, those messages are grafted in my memory forever. Whatsapp auto back up is on but apparently it never backed up anyway I have a phone back up on my macbook but I don't know if it stores whatsapp chats I mean, im no expert by any means, so keep searching.

But im just speaking from common sense, that is what backups are for, if it wasnt backed up..... well... you see what im saying Did you make the backup of your iPhone with iTunes or Finder? itunes. i just can't seem to find any whatsapp data (i'm not tech savvy at all so that could be the problem) Try some itunes backup extracting program to check if any whatsapp data there."

Thank you";2020-09-26 00:43:59;"How? Not using WhatsApp ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Just do not allow WhatsApp to notify your contacts of the number change (it will ask).

Then send a message to the ones you want to have your new number manually.

This will not work in Groups. The group will automatically be notified. So unsubscribe from any groups you share with people you do not want to have the new number first.

Of course, you could simply block the people you don't want to have it instead."

Strange behavior with Whatsapp (iOS + macOS apps);2;izo2sd;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/izo2sd/strange_behavior_with_whatsapp_ios_macos_apps/;1;"I think my Whatsapp is compromised and is actively being hacked. Here is what happened. Sometime ago, I started getting a weird popup in Whatsapp iOS app to confirm my profile selection. This is the same screen that you get when you validate your account code. This happened 2-3 times; so, I enabled 2-FA. When I did that, the profile thing stopped but for a while now, I have been getting a message in Whatsapp Web macOS app that ""WhatsApp is open in another computer or browser."" This happens almost every day. When I check logged in devices, it doesn't show anything, which makes sense if the logged in user logs out of the web application/

I have emailed Whatsapp team to provide my session logs for logged in devices but they told me that they cannot provide this information (and also the typical ""whatsapp is taking security very seriously"" response).

This behavior is very suspicious and I don't really know what to do other than change my phone number. Is there any kind of a security measure that I can take or is there any way to access the session logs from Whatsapp?";2020-09-25 20:41:30;Same here, try out WhatsApp Business (with the same account) and see whether it still happens to your account daily.

I have fixed it by resetting my phone to a new phone and then restore from backup. However, I didn‚Äôt realised I ran out of space on my windows and I lost all my data, don‚Äôt be a spastic like me. Always double check storage üò≠ So even after reinstalling the phone, it worked but then it stopped after i changed some settings in the sound and haptic feedback section and i realised if i turn system haptic on, it fixes the problem, if it's off then the shutter noise will be loud. I had the same problem too and it was insanely LOUD no matter what I did. Then I just casually went to settings to see if there was anyth I could do and I found that under ‚Äúsounds & haptics‚Äù if u scroll all the way to the bottom u will see ‚Äúsystem haptics‚Äù and previously I turned it off for some reason which was when my WhatsApp camera shutter became rlly loud so I just switched it back on again and the WhatsApp camera shutter was soft again and back to normal. Hope this helps!! :) Thank you for your UPDATE. Now it works well. The shutter sound is in normal as system sound level Nope, still suffering I done that as well still nothing and I found out that lowest ringer is louder than the highest ringer wtfüòÇ I also faced with this problem (Just updated from 13.5.1 to 14.1 with OTA, on SE 2020), and System Haptics trick worked for me too! Thank you so much, really appreciate it. But I hope future WhatsApp updates will fix this weird issue. oh, that seems to work! Thank you very much! This workaround works! Wish it would just be fixed though. It's been around since the initial iOS 14 beta It works with my iPhone X. Thanks!! Thank you, Thank you, Thanks you, thank you, thank you tytytytyt!

Sending voicetexts the sound would play at MAX VOLUME even when I had sound turned all the way down. You deserve a cookie. Someone give this person a cookie!

And if anyone knows a WhatsApp programer punch them in the arm. That works for me too! Been annoyed with this bug. Thanks for the solution! üòä"

I used Backuptrans to transfer chats from my Galaxy S9 to my iPhone SE 2020. Works like a charm. So you can have a try. No Does it take alot of time, first i made a backup and it was 32gb then i used the backup to restore data to android and it's taking more than 5 hours now just to analyze the backup is this normal? Just saw your comment, hopefully it ended successfully, mine was half that size and it took awhile but don't really remember the exact number, maybe like an hour? I guess it also dependes on the number of files (usually many small files is worse than large files for processing).

**I have a Vodacom Fibre account.**

Now, while I expect them to call me & offer me products from time & spam me with SMSs, **Whatsapp is a personal space I did not invite them into**. Whatsapp is for _people_.

I got a notification on my PC, watch and phone, just as I do for any normal whatsapp conversation.

Imagine a company being able to initiate a DM to you on Facebook? What troubles me is the direction this is heading in.

_Apologies for updating this so late. I meant to add this context this just after making the post._ Oh cool, this is garbage. I remember something similar was happening on Viber, which prompted people to leave it. I know I'll be on the lookout for any friends who want to leave WhatsApp after this, finally move them to a better messenger. I'm honestly just waiting for facebook to fuck WA https://www.change.org/NoVoiceNotes Nope. Not anymore. WA now allows in-channel initial messages now. Typically they'd have to contact you first via another channel (such as the app or sms) and ask your consent but now they're allowed to contact you via an in-channel (WhatsApp) message. >**Whatsapp is a personal space I did not invite them into**. 

- If you have given them consent to contact you, they will contact you.

>Whatsapp is for _people_.

No. WhatApp is for Facebook (the company) to make money off of you.

WhatsApp for Business is a thing. It is literally _designed for businesses to interact with their customers._

That is what WhatsApp for Business is *for*. To get businesses into the FB ecosystem by giving them tools for Customer Management. Like it or not, that is what is going on here. And if you are their customer, they are allowed to contact you (depending on jurisdiction, consent will be implied with the relationship, but laws vary).

Just block them and move on. Boy do I have news for you No that's not true. Companies are allowed to ask consent when you contact them first. (before that was not allowed either)

""Businesses are required to obtain opt-in before sending proactive notifications to customers."" 
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/guides/opt-in/

They are not allowed to message you outside of the 24h window without prior consent. Only exception is for issue resolution, if you contacted them first and it took them more than 24h to get you an answer. Yeah, I guess. This was the first breach like this. I would pay for whatsapp if it would keep it private (I actually did in the past). Not anymore. This wouldn't have happened otherwise. Go and check the updated rules. It isn't the case any more. I just edited to show the link. It's there. First line in the opt in rules.

Strangely the other guy who posted here also mentions that one of the devices in their case was also an iPhone 11. 

Might be an iPhone 11 issue but unclear. Don't think there has been any communication from WhatsApp about this yet. I'm having the same problem with someone on an Android phone (Google Pixel).

I recently updated my iOS to 14 (iPhone XR).

We can both call everyone else on various devices (both Android and iPhone) just fine. Same issue here. 

IoS 14 to Android ??. Canada to South Africa. No solution yet but interestingly I'm on android and she's on iOS too (iPhone6 or 6s, can't recall) My other contact is using an iPhone6/6s (don't remember) so it can't be specific to iPhone 11s Yeah

Where's your location, maybe it's an EU/US thing? I'm in EU, she's in US

I called my dad & he's also in EU (but on iPhone) and it worked fine, it also worked fine when calling another android, so the issue is isolated to just this one contact Both of us are in Europe I'm in the same region as the other person. I don't think it's location-based. weird af

2) If the person move the location of the image in their gallery (add to another specific directory) whatsapp can't delete the picture anymore. no the person had a time limit on their whatsapp when i sent the picture. so they did‚Äôt get the notification and didn‚Äôt see the picture in the chat.  i deleted it before they opend their whatsapp and i‚Äòm wondering if the picture is still saved on their phone I think he will only receive a 'message deleted' and never receive the picture.. 

if i understand correctly it's a parental control who restrict the access to the app so it would work the same as he turned off the phone..

Is it possible the Block timestamp is incorrect? I may have caught my girlfriend cheating, I need to know if this block timestamp ever glitches out. She denies having blocked this person and says the date is wrong, ‚Äúno clue how it picked that date.‚Äù Could she be telling the truth?;12;iy0mls;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/tf8y6ssttso51.jpg;14;[deleted];2020-09-23 04:18:20;"I know you're looking for a technical response, but seriously dude;  just take a break from the relationship. If you're feeling this paranoid - then you're either right about her cheating or you're too emotionally insecure. Either way, you are much better off finding someone else who doesn't make you feel this way. Take a break from the relationship. Both of you need it. Don't let it go to the stage where you lose your self-esteem.

While she still has respect for you, let her into therapy To answer your question, NO, it has no glitches. Also, it's date stamp, not time stamp. To glitch with date, it has to have error of 24 hours. Date stamp is correct.

Stay away from her for few days till you sort it out. No, she lying bro. Stop fishing for ways you can trust her. You cant. If you need to look girlfriend whatsapp because of those things better to be single then. if you are in concern just break it. i have cheated  3 times. there is no smoke without fire. I never heard about timestamp glitches on whatsapp. The timestamp is when the messages arrive on whatsapp's servers. I've done updates, import/export of the message (backups on cloud), blocked and unblocked  and the timestamp where aways right. Even if the person send the message when he's blocked. iOS 12.3.1 if that matters.

Like could that timestamp change if she updated Whatsapp versions on that day, or some other odd scenario occurred?

This pretty much will make or break in my relationship depending on what you guys say. I‚Äôm looking for a legit coding response 

Is there zero possibility this date could be arbitrarily picked upon updating the software, for example? Or some other code shit that might cause glitches

And why wouldn‚Äôt the unblock be there? Whatsapp shows history of unblock too, which can‚Äôt be deleted, wouldn‚Äôt that be there too? If your relationship hinges on reddits 2 cents on a WhatsApp issue.... That relationship probably isn't worth saving my dude. If the iOS 14 was recently updated & then this shows up, there is a chance this is a glitch. Given that iOS 14 has had a few unresolved bugs before its public roll out. But if it‚Äôs 12.3.1 & has stayed on 12.3.1, the date is correct.

Edit: A change in WhatsApp version won‚Äôt alter the dates or show them up now suddenly after months. There's a good chance. Pretty much all data for WhatsApp is in the device, so if they only backup ```blocked: true``` for a contact and not the timestamp associated with it, a later day when the backup overwrites local data it might show the new date.

To check this theory, you can block someone today. And two days from today, back up your entire data, clear data for WhatsApp or Uninstall and then reinstall. Check if the timestamp changed. Ensure that the entire data is gone (WhatsApp shouldn't say local backup found) before the reinstall.

Stay strong brother Thanks, looking moreso for a technical response, on possible explanations for why that would appear, and for example not the ‚Äúunblocked‚Äù message, just the re-blocked Thank you very much, much appreciate that response"

Grandmother's WhatsApp crashes and restarts after sending multiple lines of text.;1;ixvn0u;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ixvn0u/grandmothers_whatsapp_crashes_and_restarts_after/;2;"Hello,

My grandma's Whatsapp crashes when she tries to send a message containing multiple lines of text to someone. It doesn't happen when she sends 1 line of text.

I haven't seen this before, does anyone know how to fix this?

Device: Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo Plus
Android version: 4.4
Whatsapp is up-to-date (checked in Play Store)

What I've tried;

* Restarted the device
* force closed Whatsapp
* wiped whatsapp cache
* wiped system cache

**update: solved the issue, needed to download a newer version of Whatsapp that wasn't available (yet?) on the play store**";2020-09-22 23:31:15;"I could be wrong. This might be due to other apps eating up a lot of RAM or due to low internal storage. WhatsApp worked fine in my old 2.3.6 android phone, but something like this happened to me. Had only 190 MB RAM in there. Couldn't use much apps due to that, plus only 290 MB storage space. That was 7 years ago. Hm. I get it, I would hope the phone would do fine for just whatsapp and facebook stuff for a little longer. (She has difficulties adapting to new technologies so every change is one too much)
I'll look into that, thanks."

But with that you'll need to inform your old contacts that you changed your phone number. You can inform those people by using whatsapp's stories and previously blocking the person you don't want to now your new number.

Or you could block the person you don't want to have your new phone number and proceed to change it in settings afterwards."

Facebook is trying to Snoop around. there is no reason that WhatsApp will ever need that data. [deleted] I really don‚Äôt like having any Facebook applications on my phone, Facebook has been previously caught accessing devices data without user consent, I don‚Äôt trust Zuckerberg.

Got this message this morning, recently updated to IOS 14, nothing broke when I selected Don‚Äôt Allow, so what is Zuckerberg snooping for on my network? That is to facilitate WhatsApp Web. Without that access WhatsApp Web will not work.

Edit: WhatsApp Web s a separate thing to the WhatsApp app.

Edit 2: above comment is incorrect, based on.out-of-date information. on networks you use.......?

So any other device on any network you connect to can be ‚Äòdiscovered‚Äô by WhatsApp. Anywhere you access WiFi?  That‚Äôs unbelievable, or am I being naive? u/skynetengineer It's a feature on ios called [continuity(Hand-Off) ](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681) I think. It's to find other iOS devices that use the same Apple ID that way you can reply from the other device. For WhatsApp web, you need this !!! But what's it used for? Others are saying it's not for the Web version, what could it be then? I've noticed a number of apps asking for this permission where they have no need for it. Most work just fine without the permissions. I just assume it's either malicious or just asks for all permissions my default (and hasn't been updated for ios14 yet) All whatsApp needs to communicate to WhatsApp Web is a network connection.

It doesn't need access to devices on the network as WhatsApp web is ~~not~~ a p2p connection.

When you use whatsapp web the connection is started on your phone and goes to the whatsapp web server.

In what part of this connection does the app running on your phone access other devices on your network to facilitate a whatsapp web chat?

Edit: I wonder if the downvoter can explain where I'm wrong? WhatsApp has been working fine since I did IOS14 last week, this alert showed up today, WhatsApp worked just fine without this access It does, tested WhatsApp web from a computer on the same network, while blocking local network access in WhatsApp, WhatsApp we still worked I don‚Äôt think WhatsApp supports that feature, as far as I am aware, I can not continue a WhatsApp chat on another IOS device.

I have 2 iPhones, same Apple ID, different phone numbers, can not use the same phone number on more than one device. WhatsApp web doesn‚Äôt need it, tested without this access and it worked fine Facebook has been caught accessing device resources without consent, so Facebook has been caught doing malicious things with their software before. You are wrong. Your phone needs to be on **_the same_** WiFi network for WhatsApp Web to function.

Edit: above comment is incorrect, based on out-of-date information. I said: WhatsApp Web, not the WhatsApp app.

Do you know what WhatsApp Web is? It's called hand-off. [Here is someone that enabled it by mistake](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7999604#:~:text=On%20Mac%2C%20choose%20Apple%20menu,System%20Preferences%2C%20then%20click%20General.&text=On%20Apple%20Watch%2C%20open%20the,and%20turn%20on%20Enable%20Handoff) That‚Äôs correct, but it can be faster with local access as it eliminates a round-trip to their servers. what about when I'm on mobile data? WhatsApp web is ~~not~~ a p2p connection so your assumption is still invalid. How do you use WhatsApp Web on mobile data? 

You create a personal WiFi hotspot for your other device.

You are using the same network.

If you have your phone **_only_** on mobile data, and computer on a **_different_** WiFi network, then WhatsApp Web will not function.

Edit: you are correct. My information was not up-to-date. I tested WhatsApp web with my phone and the other computer being on the same network, without allowing Local Network access, and it works fine. No.

I use whatsapp web a lot.

All it uses is a connection to the internet.

I scan the QR code with my phone and it connects to the whatsapp server and opens my chats on the web page.

All what I've just described does not use other devices on my network in any way, just my phone and the browser on the pc, This could be an internet cafe or any network either way my phone is using mobile data.

Im not a whatsapp user, but I received to messages earlier today in Spanish saying that a verification code was sent as if someone is trying to set up an account with my number.

My understanding is that whatsapp can be used to accept all my standard text messages (?), So as a precaution I went and actually created an account and linked my number and such. I received a matching text message with a different verification code in English while signing up. About 15 minutes after doing this, I received another verification code text in Spanish? 

Is this something I should be worried about? Anything I can do?";2020-09-20 23:09:13;"WhatsApp will not accept your normal SMS messages. It is an alternative to, not a replacement for, your standard SMS.

Don't answer any requests from people wanting verification codes; it is a scam to hijack your account.

You can turn on two-factor authentication in WA. That makes it impossible for a third party to take over your account even with a code."

I can assure you neither Google nor my phone have any contact at all: I had delete them all from both places as part of this kind of research in order to find or probe where those  contacts came from.

So allow me to doubt your saying: my experience tell me otherwise. Best to reinstall WhatsApp. Which version are you using? Any third party app? Undelete kind?

I have WhatsApp open and I'm backing up to google drive. I have the correct account as well. The backup says 88meg of data in WhatsApp and it took time so I'm assuming it is transferred over.
Next I go to google drive.
I have swiped right and it says. ""no computer syncing"" and that is it. Nothing else.
This is all done from my phone. Sorry if I missed something along the way, this is becoming very frustrating. I'm switching phones and want me chats backed up before I install and log into my new phone. Oh bro Sorry I misunderstood. I can't help you then :/ hope you fix this problem. Ok, I finally got it to back up on google drive.  So now, how do I restore it from the new phone?  

1) Install whatsapp on the new phone

2) log in

3) then what to restore?"

Recently we've been going on through a situation, and we are essentially lost in what to do.

Few days back a random number started sending messages to some people I know asking for money. This number is using my girlfriend's picture and name.

My girlfriend is an architect, and she relies heavily on WhatsApp for customer prospect and communication, especially during the pandemic.

We started by reporting the number, then blocking it. Everyone we know has already reported it, but we keep getting messages through my girl's official social media with more and more people receiving messages from the same number. We even went so far as to call the provider and reporting it to them, but to no avail.

Is there anything else we can do to report it to WhatsApp? We sent some emails to support, but again, it seems that nothing was done about it.";2020-09-18 17:27:13;"Whatsapp FAQ - Staying safe
https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/staying-safe-on-whatsapp/?lang=en Something does not quite add up here. In modern versions of WhatsApp, a profile picture and name will not show up unless the number is already in your device's Address Book (and yours in the sender's). The message would show just the number as the sender - no picture or name.

E.g, the name and picture is delivered from your own Contacts, locally on your device - *not* from the sender.

Either someone you know has access to your device and has messed with your Address Book, or your WhatsApp version is more than a year old, which doesn't make sense. And don't use mod apps, blue, pink or other whatsapp app that is not from Apple or Google store. For some reason I wasn't aware of this page, we will report through the means stated in there as well. We are using the app from the app store, the original one, not any mods. I‚Äôm on iPhone. In my privacy setting, I can allow Everyone, My Contacts, or Nobody to see *my* profile pic not the other way around. Meaning scammer doesn‚Äôt have to be in my Address Book for me to see their pic but I could make it so they have to be in my mine for them to see my pic. Not anymore. In recent updates, you can't see the profile pic unless both parties are in each other's Address Books.

IDK exactly when this was changed, but more or less a year ago. 

Your personal privacy settings are since secondary to this."

https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/chats/how-to-restore-your-chat-history Hi. This evening I was helping a family member who had the same issue. We wanted to restore from local backup instead of google drive, because the google drive backup was corrupt - or at least the chats were not coming back.

After several hours of cursing at WhatsApp's crappy documentation and half-working instructions spread over the internet, we finally managed to do it. Based on what you wrote you have clearly also searched a lot, and you \_almost\_ got all the steps right - assuming our method works for you as well.

Here's what we did, starting from very the beginning. Hope this helps someone.

1. Install a file management app. My favourite is [X-plore file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lonelycatgames.Xplore&hl=en_US). Use it for steps 2-4.
2. Copy the latest `/WhatsApp/Databases/msgstore-YYYY-MM-DD.1.db.crypt12` file to another folder, for example /Downloads
   1. **NOTE 1:** check the modification date on the file. Any messages/photos you received since that date will be LOST.
   2. **NOTE 2:** To be on the safe side, you should copy the entire Databases folder to another device. Just in case your phone dies in the next 30 minutes.
3. In /Downloads, rename the copied `msgstore-YYYY-MM-DD.1.db.crypt12` to `msgstore.db.crypt12`
4. Copy `msgstore.db.crypt12` back into /WhatsApp/Databases - make sure to Overwrite the existing file.
5. Open the Android Settings and navigate to ""Apps and Notifications > Whatsapp"". Uninstall Whatsapp. When it prompts to keep local data/files, do not check the box.
6. Open the Play Store and Install Whatsapp again. **Do not open Whatsapp afterwards.**
7. Go back to Android Settings > Apps & Notifications > Whatsapp. There is a submenu called ""Permissions"" or something. Open that and give Whatsapp all permissions in advance, this will allow it to read the local backup. **Do not open Whatsapp afterwards.**
8. Go to Android Settings > Accounts and locate your Google account. In the next step we'll remove it temporarily to prevent Whatsapp from checking Google Drive. 
   1. **Note 1:** Run all Backup/Synchronization jobs for your Google account.
   2. **Note 2:** If you've setup your phone to confirm your Google logins, make sure you have a working phonenumber in your [Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) settings so that you can still receive security codes. (most likely Google already made you do this years ago, but now's the time to check)
9. In case you left the screen, go back to Android Settings > Accounts and open your Google account. Now remove it.
10. Open Whatsapp, confirm the user policy thing, activate your phone number. Now, it should ask to restore from Local Backup. Click Restore.
11. Right after restoring, WhatsApp will ask you to configure Google-Drive backup, and then forces you to login to a Google account before you can use Whatsapp. This is fine, we've already gotten what we wanted. Login to your Google account, confirm with the security code. Let it restore apps (yes they were still there, no it doesn't hurt)
12. Navigating back to Whatsapp we saw all chats were there, and it was also restoring some Photos from Google Drive."

Changing my number;1;iugbvd;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/iugbvd/changing_my_number/;0;"Hello,

I use an iPhone and have recently changed my number. I've changed the Apple ID and iCloud associated with my phone and uninstalled WhatsApp.

There are a couple of people on WhatsApp who I do NOT want to be notified that my phone number has changed when i re-install the app.

I have read that whilst you can disable the function which tells all your contacts that your number has changed, WhatsApp will automatically tell any groups that your number has changed, regardless.

Question. Assuming I want to start from ""fresh"", is there any way I can re-install WhatsApp and just contact the people who I want to know my new number? Without WhatsApp going full automation on me and notifying everyone?

They say messages are encrypted. Can a court get access to the message content?";2020-09-17 03:51:42;"Nobody can login to your account. When your number is logged in a new device you'll get a text or call with verification code. So you're safe. If you use ""WhatsApp Web"", remember to log out if it's not your personal computer. As far as whether a legal entity can access your chats, yes they can. But only if you're a terrorist or national security threat. Otherwise there's nothing to worry about. Enjoy WhatsApp! üòä better yet, just use a messenger without the mobile phone number requirement. Eg. Session, Wickr Some more really worrying info:
There are some modded WhatsApp (WhatsApp plus, things like that) in which you can see the content of deleted messages. I mean, people don‚Äôt really how bad it is? It means when you delete a message, WhatsApp doesn‚Äôt really delete it!! Other can see with tricks, terrible software imho. We all use it JUST because of that, everyone else uses it. WhatsApp is supposed to be really secure because it‚Äôs end-to-end encrypted, so not even authorities can access your messages. That‚Äôs why they always show off against other apps as Telegram (my favorite).
That‚Äôs the idea that WhatsApp from *Facebook* sells us.
But.... You have to backup your messages not to lose them, and guess what? Those messages are saved in Drive and Apple clouds, and those messages are NOT end-to-end encrypted. So this government can access that data owned by Facebook (WhatsApp is from them). So yes, courts may ask them for that data if they need to investigate you. But I don‚Äôt trust Facebook, I don‚Äôt trust USA, I don‚Äôt think my messages stay safe even if I‚Äôm not a terrorist, Facebook is not a company to trust don‚Äôt even ask why. 

Furthermore WhatsApp offers poor privacy settings, you can‚Äôt disable calls for some users or non-contacts, you can only make exceptions with Status, you have to provide your phone number for other to text you. I use it bc it‚Äôs required in my job, just that. I hope it‚Äôs changing soon 

Sorry for the Bible xd So like in a divorce case they can‚Äôt subpoena my message content? What if I had a number A which was used to setup WhatsApp. After few years, I decided to change to number B and setup a new WhatsApp with this number.
Meanwhile if number A is taken by another person and he/she sets up WhatsApp with that number, they have all my old messages? Backups are already encrypted and they will add an option to encrypt them with a password I don't think so. But I'm not a lawyer either. My guess is no. They can use your account, but they cannot see your old messages. Because the old backups are either in your local storage or in cloud (Google Drive for Android, iCloud for iOS). They can however see the groups you're part of, and hence all the contacts in those groups. Now that I type this, I am realising how much of a big oversight that is from WhatsApp Inc. Don't they deactivate your account after 6 months or something? I've heard that happening to few people. But as long as you own the number, you can setup again. So even after 6 months of inactivity, your account will still exist?? I use it everyday, so I don't know the answer to that. I'm assuming you can reactivate. This happened to me. Usually old numbers are reused after 6 months, if the original owners fails to validate/recharge a number. When I got a new number, I installed WhatsApp with that number and immediately I was added to 3 different groups. I dont know if they have made any updates to prevent this from happening."

Please help, opening google link through whatsapp (iPhone);0;iu3rk1;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/iu3rk1/please_help_opening_google_link_through_whatsapp/;0;"My mum received a link from a friend to leave her a review on her google page, when she opens it and follows the link to a review page, my dads profile appears, as in, he would be leaving her review, not my mum. My dad has tried to completely log everything to do with his account out on the phone, yet the review bit still shows him, not my mum.

I have tried to solve this, but without luck. I am on android myself which does not help.

when the link is opened, the page opens as part of whatsapp, i suggested to copy the link and open in a browser, he cant see his profile there, it is only when the link is opened through whatsapp.

Any ideas?

My friend thinks her boss is reading her messages;9;itlzdw;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/itlzdw/my_friend_thinks_her_boss_is_reading_her_messages/;13;"Hi, my friend's boss is apparently dropping hints at work which she is confident relate to things she has said on Whatsapp. She has multiple group chats with colleagues and uses work WiFi, and so thinks this might have allowed him access.

Is this possible, that he could have gained such access? I want to know how to check and if possible how to prove that he is doing this. Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks";2020-09-16 04:24:00;"Not possible unless someone sent screenshots. Maybe it‚Äôs colleagues in these groups who share this info with boss... Maybe he is in one of the groups It could be that one of the members of that group is friendly with the boss or sleeping with them.

You could go the Coleen Rooney method and put a different  but of info in one chat at a time and see which one comes back to you. Getting a message that you will know he has seen by looking at him is the key. Like joking you no bra on and see if he stares (bad example but you get the jist). Say you're in to star wars or something he is in to and wait for the references to start when he talks to you next.

That will allow you to narrow down which group it could be and then take it from there. The messages she thinks have been compromised aren't to her colleagues, they're to me and other non-work people.   
She has used Whatsapp Web on a work computer at least once, but says she logged out. So the only way he could have continued access would be if he used a key logger to get her password when she used the work computer? Would there be any evidence that he was doing that? At this stage it seems unlikely, but it would be good if we could prove that it wasn't happening, to give her peace of mind. I think either your friend's boss uses the phone without her knowing or she is using WhatsApp Web on a work computer. This allows the boss to see everything she is doing.

How can your boss watch? Well keyloggers are probably to blame since every key input is logged and such. Unless she use web whatsapp at work and pc have a key logger or boss grab phone and log in whatsapp web from his pc. I was actually thinking we could mention her having been in close contact with someone with Covid and then not feeling well, but being unwilling to take time off or get tested. She wasn't keen though. Keylogger can't grab whatsapp password cause there is no password to grab. Whatsapp can only work for 1 device at the time, she will get a notification in his phone if someone attempts to log from other device and whatsapp block it waiting approval and the other person will need his phone number, if they cloned the Sim card (to tricky) to get sms code still will need cloud password for backups and read messages, even if he grab those backups they are encrypted so it will be useless.
If your friends don't use work pc the only way left is someone giving the message content to him directly, because we're talking messages from you and your friend and both don't want those messages be read from others meaning that a third person with access or knowledge of the content give away to the ""boss"".
If they monitor network at the work place (most likely) IT guys will not give this info because is encrypted end to end even if he monitor the net himself.
I will bet for bad friends you or your friends have in that way his boss know about messages content.
For ""Peace of Mind"": Keylogger works in the background as a program or Windows service (depends on how well is configured) the task manager will provide this info under process tab she will need to find out the process name (the name varies cause the coding of the Keylogger) all of them will need Anti-virus except because they are to invasive and Antivirus will detect them as virus (they are if we see porpoise of these) instead of see process in task manager she can see if there is a program or process in antivirus exception and remove it from the list, then restart pc and antivirus will do his work. If the pc don't have antivirus program install one asap.
Windows 10 brings Microsoft Essential by default or can download other free or paid ones. Instructions for how to do this depends on windows version and antivirus version. You can find tutorials online. Forgot to say what Keylogger does, they don't grab passwords they grab all key stroke you input, if you type ""wasd"" the Keylogger will grab ""wasd"", if you type your password or message they will grab those, email, password, sentences, all you input in whatever program you are working or open. Some of them or if the option is configured will also take screenshot, grab camera and others. Your antivirus will block them if you have one and send alerts to you. That's a possibility too. But you can sign out from all computers from your app. Keylogger is still possible. Creepy, maybe illegal, but possible. If the computer she is logged into is on a company network he could also have admin access and legit see her typing and doing whatever on a separate shared screen

Ghost edit: don't use what's app Web on networked compuers Sorry about the mess out the back. I'll clean it up before boss sees it. If he's sees it we are all screwed.

Or ""I can't control myself when a man rolls his sleeves up, gets me every time"" then wait a few days to see"

You know what people will use it for, clearly because you have to say if its legal or not.   

They're are pleanty of mass marketing apps that don't send unsolicited messages to phone numbers.  You are taking away the right for people to opt in to marketing via phone number. It's wrong and your marketing verifies you know it sounds shady. You need a brain storming session with your friends or family and think of your target audience.

And if you don't own that number anymore, it will sooner or later go back in the pool. Some day, some random person will buy it and maybe try to register it with WhatsApp.

Unless you set it up with two-factor autentication, you will lose it. Also, you will lose it if you ever need to switch to a new device.

Better migrate to your current number before that happens - at some point, both those scenarios will come about. Well I had checked earlier with a friend, and I didn‚Äôt appear to be in their contacts at all... You better migrate your account to the new number, because eventually the current one will get recycled and see stranger will have access to your contacts."

But if there's no backup, maybe you need recovery apps to [recover WhatsApp media](https://www.bitwar.net/howto/ios/2555.html).

1. **Install the program and connect your device**
2. **Select the file types.** You can select **WhatsApp SMS** and **WhatsApp Attachments** to scan for deleted WhatsApp data only.
3. **Preview and recover the files** You can recover lost Whatsapp chats & media files if you haven taken the backup on iCloud. If yes, then you can restore all lost media files. If no, then you can try third-party app to recover WhatsApp data.

Backups overwrite, even two backups from the same account will overwrite each other. Your only option is to restore one backup, save the files, then restore the other.

I've switched to mobile connection to see if the issue remains. Maybe my internet connection is the problem, but it's odd since as soon as I open the app it connects again.

EDIT: issue still happens when on mobile connection, so it must be the app. I've installed telegram last week tho, since one of my college's professor asked me to do it. Maybe they are conflicting? ios.

It's on Hi, yes, it got fixed.

I think it's a bug of the notification software that occurs when an app enters in conflict.

In my case i think it was the game ""among us"". I unistalled it and installed it again and notifications started to work just as usual.

Try unistalling and installing any recent app you added to your phone No, many people install WhatsApp and Telegram on the same phones and they have no issues.

The problem could be the OS itself. Try factory resetting if reinstalling WhatsApp does not help. I've been encountering some other people with the same issue on android, and i have ios. I think the issue itself comes from facebook, but if it doesn't get solved i might do it."

Is this because I had cleared the chat first, or is it because I am blocked by the other person?";2020-09-13 20:11:20;"When you clear a chat it's only from your side. If you wanted to deleted messages for both you should have selected the messages individually and clicked on delete for everyone (you can only delete for everyone before 1h8min passes after the message was sent) If you delete a chat on your phone it just deletes that chat on your phone and does not notify the other person about it. It's just on your phone. The person will see she/he is blocked by that your profile photo will no longer show and the there will only be one mark when a message is sent to you (not two as normally). 

If you want to remove as much as possible about this person you have to block him/her in Whatsapp first and after that in your phone's contact book and after that press remove.

do a lot of people go online at the same time?";2020-09-12 21:18:59;People tend to look at whatsapp when they have nothing to do. We are on lockdown, no one has anything to do. I guess it shouldn't be hard for you to find your contacts online at the same time as you. Do you think a lot of people log on and log off roughly at the same time? I don't know, maybe? You said these people never met. Are you worried that they might be the same person using different phones or that they might have lied to you about not knowing each other? Otherwise I can't think of any other explanation other than it is just a coincidence. I know all these people IRL! But they haven‚Äôt met each other, I just found it interesting that all of them had similar whatsapp habits and it made me wonder how many people must log on at same time! Oh I get it.

Phone/Desktop Wifi Sync Issue on Note 20;2;irhd1e;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/irhd1e/phonedesktop_wifi_sync_issue_on_note_20/;7;"Hey all, have been banging my head over this issue since switching from my iphone 7 to the Ultra Note 20

Messages on the Note 20 do not sync with the desktop version when the screen is off/locked, they periodically  dump all at once every 3-5 minutes, or, if I  turn my screen on (don't even have to unlock it) whatsapp desktop updates immediatley

I've tried changing every setting in the book, reinstalled both client and app, tried web whatsapp, changed battery  settings, secure screen lock settings, app settings, notification settings, tried everything

Only thing that works is to turn wifi off on my phone and put it on cellular data, then it works  fine when the screen is off

which to me leaves two possibilities unless im missing something

1. The phone is somehow turning off wifi or limiting it still when the screen is off or locked, even if maxed out high performance mode (zero battery saving settings)
2. or there's some  issue with whatsapp and android specifically with my router that was not an  issue on wifi

maybe something i've missed? I can't be the only one with this issue, I bet it's happening with everyone  that uses a note 20 and whatsapp on their PC right now? can't find anything online  


Edit: I get the ""Phone not connected"" warning at the top of desktop anytime my phone is on wifi and off";2020-09-12 21:00:17;"Hi, i'm, suffering just the same problem as you

Except that i'm on an iphone 7 and it's not happening only in the desktop version but in the phone as well. As soon as i leave the app on idle it disconnects and it won't recieve any messages until I open the app again. Could you check if that is the case for you as well?

The issue remains in cellular data as well for me.

Maybe it's the app, since this started to happen yesterday. I figured this out from a youtube video by the way,

on my version of android theres a hidden settings page I couldn't find on my own called Special Access

If you search for ""Optimize Battery Usage"" on your app search bar, select all apps at the top of the optimize battery usage page, you can turn off the advanced battery optimization setting for whatsapp and other apps

immediatley fixed my sync issues and screen off updates on wifi, always worked on data, knew it was a damn battery usage setting just havent had an android since the s3 and didn't know that settings page existed ... spent over an hour looking through settings and battery settings specifically too I saw your post, our issue is a little different, mine was specifically when I switched from iOS to android recently , and when I turn my screen on or unlock my phone it immediately updates the desktop version, not sure if its updating the app in the phone with my screen off ill check if im getting notifications that way tonight didn't think about testing that

issue could be a similar problem though I found nobody posting about it online and all the sudden today everyone is saying the same thing

going to link your post here just in case its related

[https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/is7mo0/whatsapp\_keeps\_disconnecting\_when\_app\_is\_in\_idle/](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/is7mo0/whatsapp_keeps_disconnecting_when_app_is_in_idle/) also, did you try checking into your phone's settings for backround apps and backround notifications? it sounds like maybe your phone is either blocking or putting whatsapp to sleep when its not open and theres a few settings for that In my case, I think that since i'm locking my phone and the app disconnects because of that, the desktop version disconnects as well. As first I thought it was the same as you, but then I noted that I also wasn't recieving notifications at all until I opened the app, regardles if i was with the desktop version or not. So the desktop issue comes from my phone app itself.

This started to happen yesterday, since on friday it was working like always. 

I think it might be an issue with facebook, but i'm surprised not that many people is suffering from it.

I also installed among us on friday ngiht, but I doubt that has anything to do... Yes, I reseted all the settings and everythign is on. Also, when I have the app opened, i recieve the notifications banners and alerts just as usual."

How to stop photos sent to me over WhatsApp from being auto-saved to my gallery on Android? Can‚Äôt find the setting anywhere.;7;ird1p3;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ird1p3/how_to_stop_photos_sent_to_me_over_whatsapp_from/;9;;2020-09-12 16:57:43;"Settings-->Chat-->media visibility (videos/gifs will also be affected so if you don't want this you need to hide the whatsapp picture folder from the gallery) 

Keep in mind that it will save them  but you can't see it there because they won't be indexed Every phone has a different gallery app. But conceptually it's the same - in the gallery app, go the WhatsApp Photos folder. There is usually a command somewhere for excluding that folder from the gallery.

It would help if you specify which gallery app you are using. Eg. Samsung Gallery app or Google Photos App etc.  Note that you'll have to change the settings for each Gallery App you are using, and that excluding the folders from the Gallery App does NOT delete the photos from your phone  (you have to do that manually).

You might want to also exclude the WhatsApp Videos and WhatsApp Gifs folders from your Gallery App. Oh thanks! So it only ‚Äúhides‚Äù them then? What‚Äôs the setting to actually NOT save them so they don‚Äôt hog up the phone memory? Ohmygosh! You're right. Never saw that setting before. Much better than my suggestion. Oh I thought the setting was in WhatsApp itself, since on my iPhone‚Äôs WhatsApp, I have a ‚Äúsave to camera roll‚Äù option in WhatsApp settings, with which I can choose whether the media that‚Äôs sent to me auto-saves to my iPhone‚Äôs gallery or not. So only the ones I explicitly ‚ÄúSAVE‚Äù show up in my photos folder. 

So for Android, I need to go to the gallery‚Äôs settings to change this? It‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs phone and she has two apps that show photos: Gallery & Google Photos. Pretty confusing to have two apps for photos. No idea what gets saved where lol. You can only prevent it from downloading automatically but when you load the picture manually it will be saved in the gallery 


settings-->data and storage usage--> media auto-download Oh but in the iPhone, there‚Äôs an explicit option called ‚Äúsave to camera roll‚Äù. You‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs no such equivalent in android and pics are ALWAYS stored in gallery if you‚Äôve downloaded them? `Save to camera roll` is like media visibility it will occupy memory but hide it from the gallery /camera roll Oh okay. Didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks!"

I was wondering how can I possibly copy everything to my new phone in the most non-cubersome way?;2020-09-11 07:27:49;"[deleted] Can you do either of the following?

\- Change your phone number on the old device first, back up, and then restore on the new phone

\- Back up, restore on the new phone with the old number, then change the number there Buddy I think you missed a point. I want to change my number as well. I think I'll resort to the first method because I have lost all access to my current number. It's just there on WhatsApp because I registered with it like 5 years ago.

Also, are you fully confident that I won't lose any bit of my messages? It's really important for me to have all of them. ""Migrate to the new number using switch to the new number inside WhatsApp."", bro that's actually the way, you need to go to settings and you would be able to change your number so you stay on all your groups and your contacts would be notified. Are you on iOS or Android? If you're on Android, then I'm pretty confident your messages won't be lost. This article gives a more detailed set of instructions:

Also please don't use it unless you know what you are doing. He might have replied earlier, when his internet was disabled or out of coverage area. The message got sent when his internet reconnected. Whatsapp does not delete the quote in case the original text is deleted. I think he is an introvert. Taking more time to type a reply he had already selected the message to reply. That way you can see the message even after you delete it. Happened with me as well 3 options:
-modded whatsapp
-was replying before you deleted the message
-he sent the message but didn't have a connection so you received it later >>GB WhatsApp<< Maybe he had internet issue and the text was sent later when the network came back. God it's so annoying i hope WhatsApp but an end to ""other"" versions of WhatsApp May be he's late current. Could be Possible ü§î The guy doesn't look that tech savy, is there any other way ?
Or can business account see deleted texts ? How did you find out that he's using GB WhatsApp? So what you're saying is you can't delete WhatsApp messages because all it takes is someone using a modded app to see them? Fucking amazing, what a feature lol. ü§£ü§£ü§£ It is ,I tested! It's just a modded app,it's not super hard to install. But if wa finds out they'll ban your phone number, so it's not recommended. Not that I know of Because i have used it and you still can see deleted texts Yup exactly that They need the modded app to begin with. But in other circumstances, for example if someone has taken a screenshot: you can delete it, but they‚Äôll have a copy as well... Such features are never failproof and thus you should never send something you don‚Äôt want to send."

I need your help. Something strange happened to me this morning . I woke up with a message from my carrier alerting me that I have used a significant amount of my 4g data plan. 
When I went through my phone to see what did use the data I was shocked to see that whatsapp is the app that did between 9 am and 11 am while the phone was on idle . Although I have stopped all media auto download on mobile connection from the whatsapp app. And set that chat backup well happen only on wifi .
Now that's not the sketchy part.
What's sketchy is that my data consumption app in the phone did point that whatsapp was  what did use the data . But from within the whatsapp app it doesn't show that I've used that amount . 
In conclusion whatsapp used more than 400 mb in one hour on background activity that is not backupping or downloading media and the app doesn't say it did. 
Now that's a real privacy concern";2020-09-06 12:12:13;"I'm having similar concerns, though haven't looked at the data use. In my case, WhatsApp ran for nearly 20 hours in the background (only about 4 in the foreground when I was using it) for the period of 10 days.

The problem is they join the group, post some spam (normally porn), then leave. As admin I can't even delete what they post, or block them as they have already left.

how to make animated stickers for whatsapp ios;3;in6zt4;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/in6zt4/how_to_make_animated_stickers_for_whatsapp_ios/;5;[deleted];2020-09-05 22:14:01;"Whatsapp will refuse to add ANY animated stickers into the app from any third party app, displaying a message: ""there's a problem with this sticker pack and it can't be added to whatsapp"" in an effort to monopolize the way people get animated stickers into the app (perhaps that's the way they might begin charging people in the future they might start to sell animated stickers).  Apparently they want to avoid copyright issues for letting people share animations without accrediting their origins.  Still, it's not fair to their users, who just want to have fun.  At this time, they only let you add the ones they supply to you.  If there is a way to get them in (and there is, because some sticker-groups do share a few) it must be (I'm guessing) by hacking the app into accepting them.  There's a couple of cool animated ones I picked up from a sticker group, sadly now some of those give this error when you attempt to use them: ""Can't send this sticker because it's too large"".

This is one of the things that slowly have made me dislike whatsapp lately.  I've put money into 3 different sticker apps, one of them has really cool animated stickers, but they can't be added to whatsapp, it gives that nasty error I mentioned. You can't do it on iOS,  you can only do it on Android.  The issue is getting the timing of the animation correct though I hate WhatsApp So do I :(

I love Telegram, though there are a few things unique to whatsapp that I wish telegram had... for example, handling the audio.  Whatsapp can share messages and audio into telegram but you can't do the same thing to whatsapp.  And audio from telegram saves into your device as ogg (not .wav) and most phones can't really open the audio when you save it.  Other than that, Telegram is a much more superior app in so many features if you ask me. with VLC it seems to me that this problem can be solved"

Is there a way to directly back up messages to google drive?;2;imwrpg;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/imwrpg/is_there_a_way_to_directly_back_up_messages_to/;0;"What the title says. Specifically, **is there a way to ditch local backups altogether and back up directly to google drive?**

I've been having low storage issues with my phone for a while. I've uninstalled all games and apps that I don't use and my phone is basically just for social media, calls and texting at this point. I still have almost no storage. I keep constantly having to erase around 300 MB - 1GB of caches to even have storage in the first place. Sometimes needing to clear the entire browsing history on both Chrome and YouTube, turning off my phone (and turning it on again), and trying to smuggle in some space by deleting pictures and videos.

Still no storage. So what does that all lead up to?

After a nice day filled with texts and whatnot, I decide to try and backup my messages. No storage even though i cleared the cache and browsing data a few minutes earlier. Cool, I do that. 

Error again, so I dedicate myself to erasing some more pictures and videos to try and sneak in some more space. By then I turn off the phone to see if I can get more storage (it happens). I see more storage, and try to go to WhatsApp... Only to discover I lost a day's worth of conversations because of that.

I know it seems silly, but I really treasure my conversations with my friends. This isn't the first time it happens either and I'm so upset at losing so much. I was planning on going to bed but this just left me too frustrated to sleep.";2020-09-05 10:03:37;

Apple use iCloud.  You need a tool called [Backuptrans WhatsApp Transfer](https://www.backuptrans.com/tutorial/transfer-whatsapp-messages-from-android-to-iphone.html) for help in this case. I did the transfer months ago when I got my new iPhone SE 2020. It works like a charm. Use [mobiletrans](https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/whatsapp-transfer-backup-restore.html).  Did it on a friends android to iPhone migration and had no issues. Thanks. Is the program legit? Cause from what I've seen it requires you to use usb debugging. Couldn't that expose your information or put malicious files onto the device? Thanks, I'll take a look. Have a question about the process. Do I need to open whats app on my new iphone and set up the number and sim card before the transfer?? It's been a while but my memory is that no you don't want to open and set up anything before you start the mobiletrans process.

There many videos like it out there which describe the process if that's helpful. https://youtube.com/watch?v=RLIRM2b5PwQ"

Also being able to create folders with names for your hearted stickers
Having like 500 saved stickers makes it hella hard to find the one sticker you're looking for, being able to sort them into groups based on themes or something will spare me all that time looking for the right sticker Most features that telegram has would be nice. To name a few:  
  
1. Option to keep your number private in groups  
  
2. Admin should have the option to remove a message from the group and to suspend someone. 1. At least 10 minutes video sending limit option via mobile device. 
2. WhatsApp camera should be more stable. A little shake and your picture gets hazy. 
3. Data and chat history should be cloud based like Telegram. Why depending on third-party apps like Google Drive? 
4. WhatsApp backup time should be flexible and not at 2 A.M. fixed. 
5. WhatsApp status video section should allow atleast 1 minute long video limit. Option of saving pictures in the gallery when media visibility is off

Polls

Pin messages in groups

""spoiler"" like in discord

mention everyone in a group

better way for searching things (search by date, from who...) 

Option to send an image without compression
Play voice note x1.5 and x2

Ability of Showing your phone in a video call (like record screen)

Transfer backups from one platform to another Whatsapp to unsave number. Happy cake day A cake in da cup to you Happy cake day dude! Or be like telegram and have stickers attached to emojis and whichever emoji you type will pop up all the stickers related to that emoji with your most used sticker at that top of that list. Thanks!

Why and how WhatsApp is reading our end to end encrypted messages ?;11;iluobe;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/iluobe/why_and_how_whatsapp_is_reading_our_end_to_end/;15;"Hello, I discovered something very strange with WhatsApp.
It is supposed to use end to end encryption.

That means my phone encrypt the message, and send it over the WhatsApp network. The only one person in the world who can decrypt it is my recipient, with his private key.

But a simple example broke my mind. Try it by yourself :

1) go to iplogger.org
2) create a URL that will catch ip's going on it.
3) do not click on it, and send it over WhatsApp on a end to end encrypted conversation. Tell your friend to not click on it !
4) check the ip's that visited your URL, you should see one.
5) tell your friend to click the link, you should see another.



Why, just after sending the URL over WhatsApp, a robot is coming to check my end to end super secret URL ???!
The two only ways I see are : messages are read by WhatsApp, or the app makes the URL leaks to whatsapps.



If someone has an explication, I would be happy to hear it üôÇ";2020-09-03 17:41:51;"I think this is because when you paste a URL in a WhatsApp message, WhatsApp visits the URL to show the description and thumbnail in the message. The message is sent encrypted.

After it is decrypted on the recipient's phone, the thumbnail is generated.

That much you already knew.

It appears you've discovered that fetching the url to create the thumbnail goes through the whatsapp servers rather than directly from the phone to the url. There might be reasons to be concerned about this but there's no reason to think it happens before the message is decrypted by the recipient's phone. Answering OP but also some of the commenters as there seems to be misunderstanding over what end-to-end encryption actually means.
If a WhatsApp message is truly E2EE, then the server cannot see its content at all, at any stage, ever. Therefore, if messages containing links are E2EE, the server cannot see the URL and therefore cannot query it to generate a preview. It would all have to be done on the client side.
Now, if you say that the URL is queried by an IP other than yours (I've not checked this, just going with what you are saying), this means the server can actually see message content so messages containing URL are not E2EE.
I have not had a look at this in more detail, but hopefully this clarifies some things. Uh you need to check the ip assessing the link again. I cannot reproduce this at all, not on any phone or operating system. Try it again on a clean phone with no apps other than WhatsApp and send it to another phone you know is clean. Maybe you or your friend has third-party software running OR is using a proxy in their browser only. There are tons of explanations for what you‚Äôre seeing, but it doesn‚Äôt look like WhatsApp is at fault. Yes, this is probably the reason, but this is not my phone's up visiting the URL.
So My message is going to the WhatsApp servers. Your phone should visit that URL to generate the preview. Does this test provide any evidence that there's a 3rd party generating the preview? If the message is E2EE then WhatsApp's server cannot access it at any stage. In all the case, if a send a private link to for example private photos to someone, WhatsApp, and btw facebook can see all my photos.

That's a very bad privacy..... P.S. just tried it myself, iplogger only shows my own IP querying the link, no other IP is accessing it. Yes, when a preview is generated, a WhatsApp server contacts the site to generate it. So the site logs it while the preview is created. Your message does go through servers, after all, just in an encrypted state. The two ends in end-to-end are 
(1) the sender sends the message
(2) the recipient receives the message.

After the recipient receives the message and it is decrypted, a thumbnail is generated for the URL. This is clearly something that can only happen when the message is decrypted. This much is not disputed here, AFAICT

OP has found a visit to the unique URL from whatsapp's servers. This is also something that can only happen when the message is decrypted. I am just saying this is probably the request we already know about (previous paragraph) rather than something new happening between #1 and #2. The surprise would be that the request goes through whatsapp's servers where OP assumed it would come from the recipient's IP address. You have to understand what end to end encryption actually means. One end is when you press send. The other end is when it arrives on the recipient's phone. End to end encryption means nobody else can read that transmission that's bringing the message from your phone to the  recipient's (something that's over in a flash if you're both online). It has nothing to do with whether your phone or the recipient's phone reveals information about the message. The fact that the thumbnail exists already tells you that the recipient's phone has revealed something about the message to a third party. You are right that any requests to the URL can only happen either before the message is encrypted (at sender's side) or after it is decrypted (at recipient's side). 
Just making clear that this means it can never happen on the server. OP says the IP that requested the URL was not that of the recipient. The best guess would be that the request to generate the thumbnail (after decryption) goes through WhatsApp's network (though OP could probably do more sleuthing to see who owns the IP). You could call this a server but it's not the same as the servers that send the encrypted message."

You can choose whether you wanna include the media or not. If you don't it'll export as txt file, if you do then it will dump in all the images and voice messages too

Oh also apparently if you choose NO MEDIA it will export the FULL conversation, otherwise you get only excerpts apparently? So try both. Probably X chat :P [deleted] Try sending it on email."

Sad but the truth... The only alternative I can think of is switching to whatsapp business and use the label system Use WhatsApp Business for business? Feels weirder and weirder coming into these threads and seeing requests for features that have long been available on other, better messaging apps. So much money from Facebook poured into the app and they can't be bothered to add features :\ Everybody? Let‚Äôs hope not. Telegram is one of the most insecure messengers on the planet and should be avoided at all costs for any serious and private conversations. I tried that but when i was setting it up, it asked me to shift all my chats from WhatsApp messenger to Business, which is not what i want, also i text my colleagues and people i work with, I‚Äôm not a business entity or a shoo There are better alternative apps out there but in Egypt where i live, WhatsApp is the thing! So it‚Äôs used by literally everyone. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs very hard to switch to another app, you‚Äôll be the only one üòÇ That's because they're not making money off of WA (can't put ads since everything is E2E-encrypted so they can't read our msgs), so they don't care about it. The most they can wean off of us is our address books, and maybe files. Eh, you have to make the switch and convince one or two friends to join, soon enough others will follow. Otherwise you get stuck with bad stuff and that just makes things worse."

Mac/WhatsApp issue!;2;ikib49;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ikib49/macwhatsapp_issue/;8;"UPDATE: FIXED! Hi guys, I hope somebody can help with a small issue I have on the WhatsApp app for Mac. I have auto-correct on, and I have some small corrections on such as correcting ""ive"" to ""I've"" etc. On iMessage and Safari these corrections work fine, but annoyingly on WhatsApp it corrects it to ""Ivee"" every time, as an auto correction. I am trying to find a way of fixing this issue by correcting the prediction (I've checked in my Mac shortcuts), or at least reset the WhatsApp predictive text feature.

Thanks!";2020-09-01 14:09:47;"Same issue here.

Stupid whatsapp business forces us to have at least one time open,

Due to corona, we are closed, yet everyday some customer will call and complaint that it says we are open in this day in whatsapp profile,

such dump app made by control freaks...";2020-08-31 13:46:30;"As a ""workaround"" try to change your `about` to say your closed and choose a bullshit hour like Sunday open from 10pm to 10pm Like the first comment said, you can mention what he said as it is a good point. An alternative is you can mention that you are not open until further notice in the about section. Make it in bold letters and italics, if formatting is available. Hope this helps. It's nice to see people offering workarounds but, like... this is totally an oversight on WhatsApp's part. Corona has forced many places shut and not having an option to say a business is temporarily closed in a time when tons of them are closed is just stupid."

I messed up a sticker replacement kinda thing and I can't fix It pls help;1;ijno87;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ijno87/i_messed_up_a_sticker_replacement_kinda_thing_and/;0;"I saw animated stickers and I thought they were really cool so i decided to make one myself but there weren't any apps to do that so I decided to change one of the sticker's webp file into a animated sticker that i wanted to send people -which I saw how to do from a tutorial on [YT](https://youtu.be/jf2Ut4_T2uY). Basically the guy in the video says to turn a GIF into a webp and then do the ol' switcheroo and change the name of the webp to an already existing one and then delete the old file so I did but there were some problems:
1.The file was too big to send even when I resized it to the correct size. It was around 7 megabytes -I realized that pretty late.
2.The file I did the switch was one of the stickers from whatsapps own stickerpacks so it probably wouldn't show  up on other people.
 
so I just went ahead and deleted the new animated webp file I made and replaced it with the old one
 
Now I can still see the original sticker when someone sends it to me but when I try to add that original sticker to my favourites and send it to someone else, it looks like the animated webp that I made on the tray and when I try to send it it tries to send the file that I tried to put in and I can't send it because it's a large file.
 
I tried backing up my chats and then reinstalling to app to fix it but it still consists.

Now I'm scared that it's in my cloud backup and I won't be able to fix it ever again.";2020-08-31 03:08:47;

How do I know if a whatsapp chat have been tampered with?

It will be solved if we can verify the integrity of the chat.

Deleting your account won't do you any good because your number is associated with it,

From next time, use delete for all feature. so now they can read them but if they respond you'll never know what they said If they have notisave or something like that, they'll still have them. No. If it has a single tick, deleting their account would not help them in anyway Exactly, once the message is sent and has reached the server the message will be delivered even if you delete your account.

Barely 1 year old Android user here.

I love the app but MY GOD HOW MUCH IT BOTHERS ME that Whatsapp Android cannot send only the latest notification from chats. For example, if I have an unread chat and ignore the notification, the next new floating notification will display both, and then they will keep on accumulating.

I have tried many settings and I cannot seem to find a way to only send the latest one (like in iOS). 

Has anyone found a way to make it like the iOS notifications. (by this I mean to make only the latest chat pop up when received)

So this happened yesterday. An unsaved number viewed my status. I don't understand what's up with this. Could anyone help out?;22;iilliz;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/fzi8b38a3vj51.jpg;16;;2020-08-29 06:34:14;"Umm, could it be that you have a different number of theirs saved on your device and they switched their whatsapp to a new number? Perhaps there was a time when you had this number in your contacts, then you added it to your list of the allowed contacts(or its added automatically if you share with all of your contacts). Then when you lost the contact the number will still be on the allowed list. So is it someone you have added to your contacts before? Cuz I can't think of another possibility. Go to privacy and change ur status in to my contact only, it 100% chance that he has ur contact saved, So if you've added a video clip to your status, when others view you get the count and the number that viewed it? I've never messed with that so I have no clue on this. Someone 'splain pleez. Check whether you have saved that number accidentally without a name. I had that issue, where I saved some numbers without setting their contact name. Indian get unlimited Internet every month when they top up so they try to use it by calling family on WhatsApp [deleted] yes maybe this is it In my case i saved a number without country code (+91) but in WhatsApp same number with country code treat as unknown/unsaved There are literally only 3 : _My contacts_, My _contacts except_, _Only share with_ and none of them is supposed to allow a person who isn't in your contacts to view your status. That's how my settings have been forever. This is not possible. I always get the count, no matter if its video or image or text. You don't? None of us are obsessed with it, it got famous and everyone started using it to an extent that now we have to use it even tho we realize there are better alternatives  just cuz everyone uses it. not only indians use it And yet here you are commenting on a WhatsApp subreddit. Thanks for your contribution btw. Helped solve my problem. Smh. Apparently not. Then i""ve never looked at this section. On the STATUS page the three dot menu icon does not show an eye icon to see who viewed. Maybe it only shows when it has been viewed? Odd option indeed."

WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption so they can't see your pictures even if you send them.

But technically any app which has access to your files can access any pictures but the developers probably risk lawsuits if they do try to steal anything without your permission.

Short answer: they can access files on your device but don't I mean the people Im chatting with
 Will they see them? üòñ yes of course but whatsapp can't see them

but if you don't send the pictures then nobody else should be able to view them"

Best solution that always works :) Once you reply to them, they get more excited and will go further. Better to block and ignore them. HOW DARE YOU, SIR!!! I think there's an additional account added to your phone. You'll need to remove that account. How do I do that? I dont know if its because I answered his call once because I thought it was from Philipines so I assumed it was family. Cause the area code looked so similar. Go to settings and then Passwords & Account. Remove all the accounts that doesn't belong to you.
Backup is in Google Drive, but Whatsapp can't find it.. Data gone forever?;12;ihxue1;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ihxue1/backup_is_in_google_drive_but_whatsapp_cant_find/;6;"I have an old Google Drive backup from ~Feb 2020 shortly before my phone was stolen. Because I was out of the country studying, I couldn't retrieve my US SIM/phone # until recently. Although I can see the backup in Drive, there's no way for me to copy or dl it. 

I've tried installing and reinstalling Whatsapp five or six times now, but it's not able to locate the backup. I've basically lost all my messages dating back YEARS. It also includes old contacts whose numbers I lost when my phone got jacked. It sucks because I can clearly see the backup in Drive, but Whatsapp won't open it and I can't copy it off of Drive or manually select that backup.


Am I screwed? Is my data lost forever?



------------


Edit: I found my own solution, but I'll leave this up for future people with the same issue. For whatever reason the Google Drive backup didn't work on my new phone, but when I installed Whatsapp on my Chromebook, it accepted the backup and is now reinstalling everything. Recovered all 5000+ messages and 400MB of media. I'm now going to save this as my most recent backup, and see if that will transfer over to my phone. If not, at least I have it on my Chromebook.";2020-08-28 04:21:42;"btw on iphone doing offline encrypted backup of entire phone with iTunes will also do the job covering all whatsapp data ? I used to have this problem. I don't really know the reason but I guess it's because of multiple Google Accounts logged in your phone, and possibly the main account is not the account with the backup. That's good to know, thanks. Since my phone is running Android, the only backup I have is on Google Drive (and Drive doesn't let you copy/dl your own backups unfortunately!) It's backed up to my main Google account, as it's under my main account's Google Drive (and the Whatsapp account is older than my secondary account). I tried removing my secondary school account on my phone but it didn't help either. 


It may have to do with having too many devices or something. My phone that was stolen had the most recent Whatsapp backup, but the phone before that had a local backup from October, which it would open when I reinstalled Whatsapp on it. But on my newest phone, it couldn't locate any backup and kept starting from scratch.


------

In any case, it's pretty frustrating that I couldn't just copy the backup from Google Drive, or have the option to locate my own preferred backup in Whatsapp settings. Glad it ended up working on my Chromebook, but if it hadn't I'd be SOL with years of messages and infrequent contacts gone. I understand your concern. I've lost my chats 2 times over 5 years. WhatsApp backups are now more stable that it used to be.

Slowly, I've leant to lose that feeling of ownership over those chats. ): WhatsApp's backups are notoriously finicky, glad to see you've found some kind of solution, most of these threads end up with people losing their data. Will have to remember this for the next time someone asks."

Messaging from web vs app;1;ihl01j;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ihl01j/messaging_from_web_vs_app/;2;"Hi guys,

I had a recent fallout with a 'best-friend'. She was in a relationship (read: secret-affair) with a married man and broke up after two years. I work in the same place as him and in during one of her fights, she told me that someone was prank-calling him and told me not to if I was the one doing it (I was furious at this accusation and her mistrust and she explained it away by saying that she had told some other people the same thing and that she was paranoid etc. Still).

Anyway, she also told me that someone sent him a whatsapp message telling him that he was an a--hole and to f-off. She tried to prove that it wasn't her, emailing whatsapp about the origin of the message, and even traveled to our/his workplace to meet him in person and talk it out. Sounds kinda desperate for someone who's innocent, but whatever...

Now, after the fallout and breakup, he would keep coming to me and speak to me and ask me to talk to her. I told him that his relationship was over and that he should move on, and that if he had cared for her he wouldn't have made up petty excuses to fight. When I mentioned to him about the prank-call accusation, he told me that he never said that. I mentioned to him about the whatsapp message and he told me that they were texting back and forth and fighting and when he stopped responding, she sent him that message, and then soon after recanted it saying that it was a virus. Sure enough, he showed me the barrage of texts and my so-called 'best friend' (whom I thought of as a sister) looks very guilty.

In those texts, she kept pressing him and calling him her husband and she his wife, followed by the text in question, followed by her saying 'omg, it's happening again...it's a virus from the porn sites I go to'.

I confronted her about this in a casual way and she went totally nuts saying that she can't believe that I mistrusted her blah blah blah and that he must have sent the message to himself to make her look guilty and (somehow) she must have signed into the web version of whatsapp.

I feel bad because I really trusted and valued this woman's friendship and guidance, but I feel like this reveals a very ugly side of her and I just want to give her the benefit of a doubt before I fully cut her loose.

So the question is: is it possible for someone else to send a text message using the web-version of whatsapp while you're also signed into the app? Thanks for any replies.

Edit: among her explanations, she previously said that she must've been hacked, and gotten a virus from porn sites she frequented...";2020-08-27 16:27:08;"Yup. WhatsApp Web is an extension of the app. You can use WhatsApp web if and only if the phone is online.

My mom's number was banned for no reason. I have tried contacting WhatsApp and I can not for the life of me figure out what happened.;12;ihjw15;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ihjw15/my_moms_number_was_banned_for_no_reason_i_have/;13;"Hello everyone. I would really appreciate some help over here as I can not understand what happened.

This afternoon, my mother tried to open up her WhatsApp and got the message that her account number has been banned. I read and reread the ToS a few times to ensure that none of the messages she or my little brother (who uses it contact his friends) had sent fell under any of the criteria that could violate any of the terms in the ToS. They had not.

So I emailed the Help Centre and was told that she was banned for activity violating the ToS, and to reply only if I thought the account was banned by mistake so that they could look into it. Thinking that is precisely what happened (after confirming from everybody individually that they had not violated the ToS) I did just that. This is the reply I got:

>Hi,

>We have reason to believe your account activity has violated our Terms of Service and decided to keep your account banned. We recieved a large number of complaints about your account and in order to protect our users' privacy, we won't disclose the nature of the complaints.

> Responses to this email thread won't be read


>--

>WhatsApp Support Team

So I've run into a wall here. My mother only had relatives, close friends, colleagues and my brother's friends' parents on her account, so I don't see how her account got mass reported, enough to be banned. I know for a fact that her account activity has not violated the ToS, or else, the way she uses WhatsApp, every user on Earth should be banned. I can't find out who's making these complaints. I can't find out what type of complaints these are. And I can't even appeal to them to look into it again because as a corporation they don't care enough about 1 single account, they have much more work to deal with. That much is clear to me. 

Can someone please guide me on what I can do here? I'm really confused as I've never been in a situation of this sort, and as we're going through some severe weather conditions in addition to the virus, WhatsApp has been kind of integral in keeping in touch with family, friends and work for mom. I would really appreciate if someone could help me out here.

Much love, stay safe everyone";2020-08-27 15:12:01;"That is an automatic response which I have been getting as well, but my reason is different. I was using a modified version of the app (WhatsApp++) which got me banned. After numerous emails I haven‚Äôt been able to get it unbanned. However, based on my research, the number doesn‚Äôt remain banned forever. Most people had it auto unbanned after two months. Hence, I‚Äôm waiting it out. Two more weeks to go for me otherwise I‚Äôll change the number. Happened to me once. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs possibility to gain back that account. This indeed is a wall.

Usually, the reason of ban is, at least 5 people have reported your number. 

I guess, the youngling is responsible for the ban.

The ban will be lifted after 60 days. Either you can wait for 60 days or get a new number. As you have communicated with support staff I'd suggest you to wait for 72 business hours(Mon-Fri).

If you don't hear back from them after that then I suggest you to take the ticket number from the support email and tweet your case to `@whatsapp`  in detail if possible. This will help escalate your support ticket to higher support staff members. Yea, I got  my no. unbanned Automatically when I just put my banned no on whatsapp login by mistook
 and I got OTP, After how long did it unban for u? I don't know exactly when it was, but between banned and login time was 7 months, I still can't figure out why I got banned, bro did you get your number back? Yea, I already mentioned, I have got my account. sorry just i am stressed out but how many days does it take for whatsapp to unban the number? and in your case in what time you got it back? I noticed many user gets his account back within 2 month. Okay, thank you so much for replying."

For some reason whenever I turn off my wifi for long hours (at night for example) my friend thought I'd blocked her because she described that my profile picture disappeared , my last seen disappeared and her message just got one tick , but when I turned on the wifi back on everything went back again in place so this could be one thing 

On the other hand, for you to just confirm if she blocked you or not you can send a second message , or the ultimate way of knowing is creating a group and adding her to the group : if there is an error while adding her to the group then you're most likely blocked"
Location data from Whatsapp/iPhone backup;1;ih72m9;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ih72m9/location_data_from_whatsappiphone_backup/;0;"Hello everyone, I hope this Community can help me out. A year ago I got into a bicycle accident and broke my collarbone. I was cycling to my house at night and hit a electrical scooter which was left behind by someone on the bicycle lane. It was very dark in that rural area. I contacted the owner afterwards and got into a debate with their insurance company about accountability. There were no direct witnesses. While riding home I shared my live location with my wife via WhatsApp.
Now I want to retrieve the location data I shared with my wife via WhatsApp that night  to prove I was at the location where the scooter was. I have a iPhone backup on my MacBook which I made like a month after my accident. 

Question: Does anyone have any tips on how to extract the GPS location data from WhatsApp on the iPhone backup?

I cancelled it to try again and this time instead of backing up the 84MB as previously shown, it now started backing up 243MB.

I guess just cancel and try again or clear cache and try again.

If all else fails . Do a local backup. Uninstall and Reinstall WhatsApp (Restore Local Backup) then try backing up to the Drive again."

Why do people hide their 'last seen' status on WhatsApp?;1;ig8wuh;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ig8wuh/why_do_people_hide_their_last_seen_status_on/;4;[deleted];2020-08-25 12:35:57;"Last seen on WhatsApp is useless as it still shows when you are online and are using WhatsApp right that second. 
In other words, sure, you can always hide when you last used WhatsApp, but as soon as you start using it again, your status will be shown as online to everyone. Everyone can see it, whether you have them in contacts or not. Personally, I hide my last seen on any app I can since there's some creeps who will send me unwanted messages and, if I don't reply but they see I was online, they'll just get mad and send me more messages demanding I reply. Like, dude, I didn't start this conversation, I don't want it and I don't know you. Buzz off. Luckily stopped it on Telegram by hiding my phone number and using the ""archive new chats"" thingy. I do this. I just want to keep this info private and I don't mind not being able to see when others last used the app. exactly. i think it's just silly to turn this option on."

WhatsApp slower on 10x the speed on WiFi;2;ifs7ou;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ifs7ou/whatsapp_slower_on_10x_the_speed_on_wifi/;0;"So WhatsApp has been really annoying for me lately, I'm on video calls a lot and use WiFi for them. The quality has been horrible for such a long time and I always figured it's because my room is on the other side of the house from the router. I've been forced multiple times to switch to mobile data due to constant lagging and disconnecting calls and just overall 3 pixels on the video. 

Mobile data has worked fine for me, but I decided to do speed tests from the place I usually sit for my calls. [Here are the results](https://ibb.co/XZzJ0bp). How come that with 10x the internet speed my quality is crap compared to the mobile network? Is there a fix for this?";2020-08-24 19:24:47;

Does the msgstore.db.crypt12 file contain ALL messages?;1;ifqmdc;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ifqmdc/does_the_msgstoredbcrypt12_file_contain_all/;3;[removed];2020-08-24 18:01:11;"Are you talking about the db file or a backup? If the former: no. If the latter: depends on when the backup was made. [removed] Still don‚Äôt really understand your question. If you go through a phone and find a backup from 6 months ago then yes, sure. Otherwise no if the person deleted it in the meantime. Deleted data is never backed up, so you need a backup from before it got removed from their history.

Each WhatsApp backup contains the entire message history as it is on the moment of creation. So if you find a backup from January 2020, it‚Äôll contain everything that was in their history at that time. If they deleted something from December 2019 in February 2020, then the January 2020 backup will have it. But the March 2020 will not, as backups only contain presently available data.

By default, I believe WhatsApp only keeps a single backup file which is overwritten upon next backup generation.

So let‚Äôs say they deleted something 6 months ago and the only backup you can find is of 3 days ago: then no, that will not contain those messages that got deleted 6 months ago."

This is very disappointing for me.   
An app that is used by billions of people doesn't warn me that the iCloud backup is not working.   
If have the daily backup activated, I would have expected it to backup my chats daily.  


Thank you for your clarification. I use android so idk if this helps but I just did the same thing and a Google drive backup pulled thru for me."

How common of a scam is this?;113;if1jet;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/sv6ta04alqi51.jpg;17;;2020-08-23 14:22:03;"It is kinda common, a lot of people fall in these kinds of scams and they take your account. They don't 'hack' anyone you are just giving your authentication away lol Sent from a contact. Apparently her account was hacked and they tried to do the same for mine. It's super common and particularly prevalent on WhatsApp. Easy way to take over someone's account if they don't have extra security enabled on any service. Yeah it‚Äôs a really a common! Even if you have 2FA set up they can still get in if you send the code. Honestly Whatsapp really isn‚Äôt secure when it comes to this scam. If the ‚Äúhacker‚Äù (using the term loosely) is in your account, they can change your 2FA pin without even entering the current pin. People have ended up being locked from their account for 7 days! 

At least you‚Äôll know if it‚Äôs happened to you because of the fact only 1 device can be on your WhatsApp account at a time. Although there‚Äôs talk of whatsapp changing this soon... Send them random numbers Yep. This happened to me this afternoon. My verification no longer works and has since stopped me verifying my number. Am I am dreamer for thinking when I can authorise my number again, after the timer resets, that my number will work? Why would they want your account? Is this the first step of a bigger scheme? They weren't ""hacked"". But for example if I do this to you , take over your account, will you still be able to use yoru whatsapp or will you be disconnected? So they can contact your family, like your dad or mom and ask them for money ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre in an emergency‚Äù. For some reason a lot of people don‚Äôt simply call to find out if it‚Äôs true or bullshit... Telling your family to call should you ever ask for money and tell them to enable 2-step verification and security code change alerts helps *a lot* in preventing this from happening. Something like that, having your account they can expand by going to your groups and sending sketchy links, apps, false information, etc. They are sending messages by your name, so your contacts are more likely to trust what 'you' send and fall into these and end in malware, websites that steal other social accounts, bank information etc You'll be logged out, I think, because WhatsApp doesn't allow simultaneous sessions. While they're in the account they can easily change the number and that's it, you lose access. Unfortunatelly a lot of people who aren't so tech enthusiasts they will send the code or money or something to someone they know as an act of kindness and the rest is history there are even some purchases apps that send the verification through whastapp instead of sms If they change numbers,  it won't change on people's contacts and will look suspicious.  What they do is activate 2fa so you can't get back into your account. 2fa dont ask sms for setting it? Yes, but then it will also ask for the 2fa and be blocked as the user will have no idea what is the new code."

Whatsapp images not loading;1;ieok97;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ieok97/whatsapp_images_not_loading/;2;"Hello everyone.

So recently I bought a new sd card with 128gb of free space to replace my old 8 gb sd card which was almost full. I changed the settings on my phone so that all of the data is stored on the new sd card not on internal storage, including whatsapp, which stored all of the images and videos.

For some reason every image and video I download kind of malfunctions. I can't view any of the images or videos. this happens about 30 mins after i download an image or video from any user.

here's the link to what the images look like: [https://imgur.com/jkP0iTw](https://imgur.com/jkP0iTw)

I've never seen so many...;2020-08-21 21:18:02;"What? I think it's not an issue because if people don't want their last seen to be tracked, they could just turn it off. And most people these days do turn it off. Most of those apps are just copies from another, like many other apps not just whatsapp tools. Shady devs making money with ads. If you want to track the last seen statuses of somebody, there are so many different apps for that on Google Play these days. It seems like when Facebook took over they didn't care anymore Well WhatsApp nowadays is just full of bots and getting absolutely no moderation.

Maybe that's the reason why there are apps for this type of stuff, it's so easy to make and the fact Facebook don't give a single shit just helps it.

I wish WhatsApp was moderated well enough to fight this shit and that they would also allow bots that are a bit more friendly like chat bots. I disagree with everything you said. It's not full of bots or not getting moderation. I think their moderation is really good and they do a lot of serious work by disabling accounts that don't follow their rules. They probably don't do anything about the bots because likely the bots aren't causing too many problems. Bots are against their tos

Recently (For the past 2 days), My Whatsapp Profile Picture Keeps getting Deleted automatically.

After adding and setting the profile picture successfully, There is no problem and everything seems normal. However,If I return to the app after sometime,There is no profile picture set!!

I did check for updates and I updated from the playstore to the latest version.But the problem still exists. Any Help is Appreciated.";2020-08-21 18:31:12;"Hi All,

Is there any update on the above thread. I'm also facing the same issue from the last two days onwards. Same. Kind of creepy. When it happens the WhatsApp icon appears in the header notifications menu on the phone very very briefly. Is the app being monitored?"

However, chances are it will be in the future. Especially now that Signal (WhatsApp uses Signal Protocol at its core) is making it possible, but also because Facebook is moving to have some similarities between their platforms. Which is an extremely bad idea by the way, but unfortunately Facebook will probably push it through. Nope. Either you can use their number or the QR of their profile. WhatsApp is not at all connected with any email addresses. No

And yeah, if you can, do a sweep for any possible info, even under Android folder (if you're on Android) and clear the cache.

Typing message iphone notification;1;idsiyj;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/idsiyj/typing_message_iphone_notification/;2;"Hello Reddit,

Is there some way on iPhone to get a notification sent to your phone when ever one of your WhatsApp contacts starts typing to you?";2020-08-21 10:47:57;Not unless you‚Äôre jailbroken and willing to risk installing third-party addons/hacks to your WhatsApp. No
'Deleted' messages;9;idrgud;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/idrgud/deleted_messages/;14;Why doesn't WhatsApp completely let us delete our message and leave no trace of it instead of showin 'this message was deleted' like Telegram and Instagram do, where once you delete a message it doesn't show up anymore. And on Telegram we can even delete old messages, not just the recent ones. Is it just because they're not doing it or have they not figured it out yet?;2020-08-21 09:16:43;"Definitely a design decision they made, so it most likely won't change. Probably to prevent ambiguity about who said what when. It shouldn‚Äôt be up to one party of a conversation to delete the complete history on the side of the other party as well. That you want to delete it is fine, but you don‚Äôt get to choose for the other for historic data. Telegram allows you to delete messages on both sides even after like a year...? That‚Äôs horrible and yet another reason to avoid that extraordinarily insecure app like the plague. 

As for not leaving a trace for a revoked message, that‚Äôs personal preference. To preserve the flow of the conversation, noting a message had indeed be sent and keep the encryption chain trustworthy: I think WhatsApp made a very good choice to do it the way they did. :) You have to remember that WhatsApp, contrary to Telegram who doesn‚Äôt give a shit about it, has security by design in mind. And from a crypto point of view, the integrity of the conversation would be broken if there is no trace at all. It is acceptable to give someone a limited time to undo mistakes, that‚Äôs a reasonable trade-off. But beyond this limited time, it would constitute a problem for sure. That's a terrible thing. If they start letting users completely remove their messages then there could be scenarios where the recipient appears to be the only person sending the person messages because all the person's messages are gone. I think once the message reaches the recipient's phone it becomes their ""property"" and no one should have the right to take it away from them especially at whim and without any notice or restriction. It shows this msg. as per user expectation. So, if you want to again restore deleted chat then, you can easily [recover Whatsapp messeges](https://recoversoft.wordpress.com/2020/11/17/recover-deleted-whatsapp-chats-and-media-files-from-iphone-or-android-without-backup/) and media files without having any backup on Android and iOS devices. It really sucks that they have to do that tho That's a very good point you make. I'm with you on that yeah. üëç > You have to remember that WhatsApp, contrary to Telegram who doesn‚Äôt give a shit about it, has security by design in mind

Are you joking? The app that had 12 critical breaches last year alone is ""security by design""? The closed-source Facebook-owned app, that app? I can see how one would argue in favor of not being able to completely delete messages. Same with how WhatsApp doesn't let you read messages in your browser without your phone connected. Curious where you get that number from. I see 6 vulnerabilities for WhatsApp in 2019, none of which are critical... Be that as it may, it is also important to note that WhatsApp \*can\* have breaches due to its security design, where a flaw is thus quickly problematic and \*not\* by design/expected. Telegram and equally poor software like Facebook Messenger are much less prone to ""critical"" bugs, because they're insecure by design and therefore a low level of security is expected and already achieves the goal. :) Can't assign CVS'es for problems that have been deliberately introduced to the core as part of the featureset you see. :) So you expect WhatsApp to be secure, but you don't expect it of Telegram and FB Messenger; hence why the first in the list is much more prone to getting ""critical vulnerabilities"". Just to put it in an important perspective as it doesn't tell the whole story. Either way, I can only find half the amount of vulnerabilities you're reporting with not a single one showing up as critical, so I'm curious what's up with that.

Either way: no I'm not joking. Even if there were 'critical vulnerabilities', that doesn't alter the fact that security and the encryption is being kept in mind when designing and evolving the app. That's a fact that doesn't change, not even if they would have failed at that objective. (They didn't, but just sayin'.) How exactly tho? Making it known to the recipient that the message was deleted rather than keeping it unknown to them might actually arouse suspicion maybe imo The decision they took is correct, people do murder, talk on whatsapp and delete message. FBI, CIA, CBI, RAW or any agencies finally can easily retrieve and can give justice > Curious where you get that number from. I see 6 vulnerabilities for WhatsApp in 2019, none of which are critical...

WhatsApp [disagrees with you](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/whatsapp-vulnerabilities-2019-critical-flaws-security-national-vulnerability-database-2171635).

> WhatsApp reported 12 vulnerabilities last year. A total of seven vulnerabilities of the total count were classed as ‚Äúcritical‚Äù.

It is not a secure app by any means and its impending merger with other Facebook properties, as well as its closed-source nature, are good hints of why it's bad. Same reason why Telegram would display an ""edited"" tag after changing a message. During a conversation, you may want to preserve if someone said something that in turn others reacted to.

It also discourages people from sending unwarranted or provoking messages. As you said, deleting them would cause suspicion. If the receiver feels harassed, they at least have some proof of when they received those messages.

Other than that I'm with you, I do prefer Telegram's way of handling things. Eh, that's a slippery slope. Privacy is a legitimate issue and I hate when officials use crime to justify stricter surveillance"

B is a spare phone without any sim card.

- Keep SIM #1 & SIM #2 in Phone A, with Whatsapp logged in for SIM #1

- Still be able to log in and out of Phone A for SIM #2 without being logged out of Phone B for SIM #2";2020-08-21 07:38:38;Why not just install WhatsApp Business on phone A and use it for SIM #2?

Not sure if I'll be able to help but is it on Android and is the backup saved on device or on cloud? If you have those files, you can listen to those audios in VLC media player. creep Nope... well, yes, my sister have it but she reboot it, all is gone, I did a security copy on that phone before everything, but sadly it didn‚Äôt work with the audios Ohh that could be the reason :c
Thank you anyway Ok, im going to try, thank you for the help <3 It is an iPhone 11 pro I have iOS but I don‚Äôt know if I can extract those files from it I have iOS, I saved everything, but it didn‚Äôt worked with the audios :c Wow thanks, i‚Äôll try, because I have the audios, but I can‚Äôt listen to them, I tried resending them to other person but it didn‚Äôt work.
Thank you for the help. I guess you haven't lost anyone in your life. Then I guess you can't get those audios back unless you can get a hold of your best friend's phone somehow and able to access it. No problem.I really hope you recover them.Good luck! I truly feel sorry for you. 

So can you tell me if the backuo was stored on your phone or on Google Drive ? Check files on computer, it has .opus extension. You can't send it to anyone. Use VLC to listen, or to convert it into mp3 then send it to anyone you like. Bruh :c
638 audios of her gone, I think her lil brother now have her phone but he lost everything too... well, at least I have her text messages :c
Thank you for the help tho I had it on iCloud Ok thank youuuuu <3"

My Problem is as follows:

I pluged a USB-Stick in my Phone to transfer my WhatsApp backup onto my new Phone. Easy peasy so far.
But now after unplugging the USB, the folders i had on my Stick still Show up If i want to share pics with my friends (256GB USB-Stick= Lots of folders). Apperantly WhatsApp has the folders in a cache and now i have scroll through maybe 60-70 folders down to get to my Twitter folder, If i want to Share a Pic i saved from Twitter. Is there any solution, maybe  cleanup the cache?

Cheers in advance";2020-08-20 01:01:50;"OK i resolved it myself. 
Go in configuration of your Phone (Not WhatsApp) 
Apps -> WhatsApp -> clear/delete Cache
Restart your Phone
It didn't work right away, so i said f IT and went to bed.
11:45 hours later the folders are gone.

Has the option to save individual photos when NOT auto-saving all photos gone? (Android);4;icjkzp;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/icjkzp/has_the_option_to_save_individual_photos_when_not/;6;"Hi all

Just an issue I have noticed recently. I have a Google Pixel 4 running Android 10 (latest updates etc). I have the feature to automatically save received photos to my phone gallery turned off, because the majority is just memes from group chats and blurry photos of my dad's cat, but there is the occasional pic that I want to save to my phone... but I can't seem to find the option any more!

I had an iPhone until the end of last year, and that definitely had the option. Since I switched to Android I really can't be sure if it's a feature I have used, but I thought I had. [This](https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/whatsapp/how-to-save-whatsapp-photos-on-android.html) page explains (about two thirds of the way down) that you just click the download icon on the photo, but I don't see that icon.

Pressing and holding the photo in question doesn't give me the options, nor does anythign in the three dots menu in the corner. I really don't want to turn auto-download back on just for the very occasonal photo I want to save... does anyone know if this feature still exists and where it is hiding?!

Thanks in advance!";2020-08-19 11:09:09;"There is an app called Solid Explorer which shows a ""save to"" button in the share menu it should do the trick

EDIT: I've been looking around and I can't find anything except a way to turn on auto saving for specific chats it's not gone it was never here If you are using Google photos then select that photo and click on share>upload to photos.

Also you can view all your photos in file explorer. Go to file explorer>whatsapp>media>whatsapp images>private

If you want then you can move them to gallery folder. First thing: there is no such thing as ""save to gallery"". All media is downloaded to your storage regardless. You just choose to hide it from the gallery apps. Thanks, I'll take a look at it! I'm really surprised there's no in-built option for this, but I suppose a third party app that will do the trick is fine. I thought there was a button for saving the pictures but obviously not"

I am happy to be far away from a manipulator and forever all thanks to him for what he did you can contact him on CYBEREXPERT256 Gee mail legitimate. Thanks for the response :) I sent it.. It looks like the whole message history for that contact is completely gone not just the message.. can this be an automated feature when someone blocks you after a while or something? Did you delete the message or give your phone to someone else? Nah, the chat stays when you get blocked
Could still be someone deleting the entire chat
Or maybe you reinstalled the app without backing this chat yet Neither of those things.. looks like the whole chat history for the person is gone It's only the one chat.. didn't reinstall either.. in an update? I've had the message there for over a year.

I checked the message a few times over the year to see if they had unblocked me (family member) it just suddenly vanished one day.. Someone deleted the entire chat history for that person. Did you accidentally press that button or has someone else had your phone? no one has had my phone been on lockdown :) I didn't delete it unless someone had access to your phone they couldn't have deleted it as the messages are stored on your phone That's what I find disturbing.. what about a malware or hacker attack? Possibly malware not sure any hacker would just go and delete messages unless they intended on doing that? My fear is that it was removed to delete any evidence of the chat.. so I guess ultimately I'm asking if it is likely that someone could break the encryption and delete the chat remotely.. if so how could i find a log of this? maybe on the WhatsApp servers? nope the messages are stored on your phone once you receive them the whatsapp servers are just used to transfer the messages Must have been some serious messages then. If it even were possible to hack this, it would be NSA level stuff. Not something a scriptkiddie would do from his bedroom. If you really didn't do it yourself (maybe by accident), it could really only be from a web connection you started yourself from your phone, I think."

Since you are saying the chats you want to recover were from a while ago, you might be out of options. Only if you backed up chats in google drive before deleting And didn't backup after deleting, you'll be able to recover them. (because every time you hit backup, it rewrites the old backup file on google drive) Even if you managed to, you'd not be able to merge the chat histories. You'd have to overwrite regardless.

A contact always comes online the second I come online -- it's creepy. Do they have a third party alert set up or something?;7;ibnxq9;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ibnxq9/a_contact_always_comes_online_the_second_i_come/;21;[deleted];2020-08-18 00:58:55;"

Whatsapp has lots of privacy settings to help with stalkers but there is one flaw/ feature.  

Anyone with your number can see your online status unless you block them.  In which case they can just get a new number and see your online status again. 

They may not be able to see your last seen time because you can disable that for everyone. 

However, simply put, they can sit there with a phone and see as you come online.   This however is not a good use of a stalkers time.  

There are 3rd party apps available which monitor when someone comes online and send an alert. These all seem to be pay apps and you have to subscribe to able to use them.  

This is how he is doing it probably.  

Your best bet would be to cancel your WhatsApp account (do not just change your sim because WhatsApp will notify your contacts of your number change) and create a new one and make sure he doesn‚Äôt get your number.  

Hope this throws some light on it. Maybe it‚Äôs just a coincidence as well. A lot of people spend the whole day on their phones...while ‚Äúworking‚Äù, while hanging out with their friends, having a family dinner. Being connected it‚Äôs just ‚Äútoo important‚Äù. I‚Äôd use a second number to check if that person just isn‚Äôt on and off every minute of the day.... then use your phone to see if he becomes online only when you do.
If that‚Äôs the case, delete your account and get a new number as mentioned above. How do you know that this person goes online when you do? Do they chat with you as soon as you open WhatsApp? Maybe the person is always online and when you open the app, it does a check to see who's online, and it looks like he just pops up active? There are some Online-trackers , that alert you when a person is online Check Chatwatch Thank you. I do not think of him as a stalker at all... we are just friends and I feel like we have a good relationship; that's why I'm posting on here; it hasn't gotten to ""block him"" status, I'm just a bit intrigued and weirded out and I want to figure out how to address it. 

He can't be sitting there watching his phone, because he is shown as offline or 'last seen' until I come on, and about 5 seconds later, there he is, online. 

I can't get around the feeling that it's quite creepy to set up an alert when *anyone* comes online. Unless they're into that too, like your long distance partner or something, and you have an agreement.

I honestly might call him out on it. It will be awkward but maybe it's best not to stay friends if he's infringing on my privacy this way. 

""Hey, this might be weird to bring up, but I notice that every time I'm online you seem to come online immediately. Do you use a third party app to track when people come online? If so, please take me off of it. I find it quite uncomfortable."" 

I'll leave it for now. I took him off contacts so he's not seeing my last seen, but that won't do much if he still has an alert set up for me to catch when I'm online. 

I find this to be an extremely destructive feature. Honestly, it really hurts someone's feelings if you see they're online but they're not responding. I'm not meaning to hurt his or anyone's feelings; sometimes I'm just in a conversation with someone else. And I don't want him overthinking it and making a big deal of it. This is a non-issue in iMessage! What'sApp is great in many ways but this is a huge flaw. > Whatsapp has lots of privacy settings to help with stalkers but there is one flaw/ feature. 

Does it? You can't even hide your phone number like you can on Telegram, that's a huge privacy issue. Ugh lol, I'm honestly not willing to put that much effort into this. I would only put that much effort in for a crush. LOL jk but seriously. I can't be bothered. For now I'm just going to ignore it and if he gets pushy about me responding I'll call him out.

You have a good point, he might just be on *all the time.* He has a full time job but I guess it might not keep him busy, and Covid is making everyone crazy for contact. Seems a bit weird to me though that he doesn't message me all day when I'm **not** online, but as soon as I'm online i get a message. (This doesn't happen every time I go online, but every time he messages me seems to be when I come online after not being on WhatsApp all day or for several hours -- as if he can't send a message and wait for a response, he wants a response NOW and ""caught you"" at a time you have to respond) Yeah so several times I would get on and start chatting with someone else and my chat would be interrupted by a chat from him. 

Then a few times I got messages from him but didn't see them til later, and as soon as I opened them his status would go from ""last seen"" to ""online"" within 3-5 seconds. I usually respond when I see a message, but this often forced me into a back-and-forth that I didn't necessarily have time for or want to have.

So finally after this happened several times, and I felt a bit weird about his ability to materialize right when I came online, I decided to run a little test. At three random times during the day I opened the app our message thread, and every time, he appeared online within a few seconds. A bit weird.... right? No usually if someone is already online, there will be no ""Last Seen."" It just shows them as online as soon as their status loads For him, it's clear that he was offline for a few seconds until I came on, and then he comes online. This seems like such an infringement of privacy. I can't fathom why WhatsApp wouldn't allow you to hide your online status. It's visible for EVERYONE including total strangers. Does it help me see who‚Äôs tracking me? Or does it allow you to track people? That‚Äôs because it was the core feature of WhatsApp in the beginning. It was an easy replacement for text messaging.  

It‚Äôs a very mature product and has kept true to its core feature set.  Lots of people are familiar with its simplicity of setup. It seems like the only explanation is that he's using a third party WhatsApp app that offers this type of feature. 

I used to use an app called GBWhatsapp which had an option to notify me when a certain contact went online. I never used that feature so I don't know how effective it is, but I know it's there. 

Recently, WhatsApp has been cracking down on users who use third party apps by blocking them. So hopefully this wouldn't be a problem in the near future. \>"" I decided to run a little test. At three random times during the day I opened the app our message thread, and every time, he appeared online within a few seconds. A bit weird.... right? ""    

Why not try archiving your conversation (thread) with him, and NOT opening up that thread/conversation.  Seems you're saying that every time you open that thread, he comes online. So why open it if you don't intend to chat with him.

On another note, I feel your pain 'cause I have the same experience with one particular person. Maybe block him?  Sounds like its.time to close that chapter and move on with the rest of the story This is all PR speak that doesn't address the issue. Other apps have the option to hide your phone number, no reason for WhatsApp to not catch up with competitors that outpaced it. Yeah, it seems though that he knows I'm online whether it's his thread or not since his message interrupted other conversations several times when I hadn't opened his message at all. I only went to his thread (w/out a message from him) to run that test, after being creeped out. I did archive his messages and removed him from my contacts so that he won't see my ""last seen,"" which I have set for Contacts Only. But I know he's seeing my online status. It seems like a lot to accuse someone of, though. I'm about to the point of doing that. It would be hurtful if I did that. I found a different solution: messaging him on the normal messenger! I just told him I'd rather text him there. He'll now have no reason to message me there, i'll move down the list, hopefully to be forgotten eventually. He can't try to catch me when I'm online, or would have to admit that he's still watching me on whatsapp if he tries to call me out. I‚Äôm speaking from experience right from the beginning with WhatsApp. You‚Äôre right though.  There is no real reason why WhatsApp can‚Äôt do that now."

WhatsApp ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô- ‚ÄòData & Storage Use‚Äô- ‚ÄòNetwork Usage‚Äô. And there it shows Messages sent and received as well as calls and total Mb usage. All the other counters are correct. Just the received messages.

Restore Have you tried going into app options for both whatsapp instances and clearing the ""open by default""? Maybe do this for google app aswell. I use Parallel apps on my OnePlus. Google Assistant asks me which WhatsApp I want to use. It could be worth seeing if swapping the SIM cards in the tray does the trick.  As the SIMs are numbered 1 and 2.  I guess Google Assistant is defaulting to SIM 1.  You might also be able to change the SIM numbering in the phone settings Backup both, clear data of both and sign in again. Maybe you shouldnt use the dual apps feature. You can back up your data and install whatsapp with a different package name (com.gbwhatsapp, com.fmwhatsapp)

You can also install the other whatsapp on the secure folder."

Banned on whatsapp for no reason;1;iawmng;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/iawmng/banned_on_whatsapp_for_no_reason/;4;So recently, my phone number got banned recently on whatsapp is there any fix and i have contacted support;2020-08-16 20:39:01;No, there's no fix unless support agrees to unban you. If you got banned it either means you broke WhatsApp's rules or someone mass-reported you. In the latter case, you might get unbanned if they admit that the ban was a mistake. Otherwise, your account is either banned permanently or will be unbanned in 60 days or so. Yea, once my number got banned automatically without any reason, last month I just put that no. by mistake, it's create and got OTP also, I don't know when it unbanned. Idk someone said i should give them admin in a group and i said i cant but he threatened me to ban my WA account Lol, sadly üò• you don't have any recordings of that conversation. I really wonder how you're going to pull it off, you really need to explain so much detail to support team.

Please, I need help restoring my Whatsapp;1;iarpnv;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/iarpnv/please_i_need_help_restoring_my_whatsapp/;4;Hi, I had an old WhatsApp account and I backed it up to my Google Drive and for some reason, it didn't actually save to Google Drive. I noticed a problem with my device and I was scared I might lose my WhatsApp, so I decided to save it manually from the WhatsApp Database folder to my SD card so I don't lose it(msgstore). After I took my device to the repair shop I was told I needed to Factory reset my device. After I got it fixed, I realised that I don't have access to the number I used for the old Whtsapp account. So I used my other number to log in to WhatsApp but it says I don't have any whatsappWhatsApp backups in my Google Drive(even when I backed it up everyday)so all I'm left with now is alot of local back ups, I would really love if there is still a way to recover my account back cause I have a lot of important messages I would love to have back I don't mind losing Media cause I have already moved all of it to my Sd card,I have also tried moving the databases back to the original WhatsApp database folder but it still didn't work. Thanks :);2020-08-16 15:42:58;"So, if I understand this correctly, you're trying to restore backup of a different number on a new WhatsApp account which is running on another number?

1. Decrypt the file and extract the messages in txt file. OR

Either she sent that somewhere or an app on her phone with sms permission did. Do this- download WhatsApp, register, fill in otp. Once WhatsApp starts working on your device it'll stop working on previous device, provided number is same. 

Next, either clarify to friends and family, or deactivate your account. She gave away her verification code, didn't she? Yes this is what happened.. the otp thing.. Moreover, 'a hacker' cannot simply start messaging people unless he has contact information of recipients. Yes she did unfortunately 
Tomorrow we regain access been a week We are trying to contact whatsapp to deactivate account so other people don‚Äôt get the same hack but to no avail - already two people fell for it from her contacts. Thanks.. we were able to deactivate the account (took 5 hours after emailing whatsapp support) but we have two friends that fell for that trap in the meantime. 
To regain access there is a 12 hour timer before getting a new otp and this is hoping they didn‚Äôt put a two step verification!"

Will WhatsApp ever borrow features from Telegram?;17;ia5zdd;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/ia5zdd/will_whatsapp_ever_borrow_features_from_telegram/;18;"I have been using WhatsApp since 2011. But now, I feel like it is still stuck in the year 2015 or 2016 compared to Telegram. Recent features added by Telegram are amazing and I would want atleast below two features to be ported to WhatsApp.

1. Hide phone number - I simply love this feature as I can hide my phone number from people I don't know in groups and channels.

2. Usernames - This is also one of the feature I love. It is super convenient to chat with someone without sharing phone number just by using username.

There are other great features as well, however everyone uses WhatsApp and it is impossible to move them to Telegram. Family group, College group, Work group, all are on WhatsApp which makes it impossible to leave WhatsApp. 

Do you think we will get above features once Facebook integrates Messenger, IG DM and WhatsApp?";2020-08-15 14:50:58;"WhatsApp has always been following Telegram in terms of features, tbh. It didn't even get web and desktop clients until Telegram did, same for document sharing, a reply feature, channels, the 'forwarded' label. All of that stuff came to Telegram first and then arrived to WhatsApp. I think they tend to lift all the popular features so these might arrive eventually. [deleted] It's like English, it might not be as smooth as the newly made conlangs(constructed languages like Esperanto), but since it's so widespread, yeah we continue using it >< I do like the feature of having statuses from WhatsApp, which doesn‚Äôt seem to be available for telegram. If it were modernised and added some good features, WhatsApp would be much better. I want whatsapp show what devices in general my phone is connected (not just whatsapp web) and the PIN 2FA code be more than 6 numbers (in telegram I have a Full 50+ character password with number, letters and special characters) Basically, the main aspect of telegram that allows for all the nice features is that it's cloud-based. When did WhatsApp got channels... Can you tell me how to use them Same for stickers. And does WhatsApp have instant view? Yes correct. Some of the features in Telegram are so good. Hope either people start moving to Telegram or WhatsApp start integrating some of the features of Telegram. What king of status are you talking about? I quit WhatsApp a long time ago. 
There are status in Telegram that do their job 
https://telegram.org/faq#q-what-do-the-green-checks-mean Yes that is a feature not available on Telegram but in my country people upload all types of useless videos and forwarded photos.

I hardly see statuses of anyone. I usually hide them so that it does not distract me. I like Telegram more in this case but this is my opinion. It's ""Restricted groups"", which is basically the same thing. Except restricted to the standard group limit. What is instant view? [deleted] I mean, like how you can post pictures or videos and it disappears after 24 hrs. I think there is a similar feature on YouTube and on instagram so like I could only read messages and not send them... ah i thought they would be like telegram's channels One of my favourite feature. It allows you to open web pages in a instant view, loading only what is needed. Really nice to read web pages. You can then makes text bigger or change contrast, put night mode, etc
https://telegram.org/blog/instant-view (from 2016) I have few of my contacts on Telegram (some were online months ago) but none of my contacts are on signal. So basically that is the issue. Also, work group and college group are on WhatsApp so can't really leave WhatsApp. In secret chat, you have this feature but not in most used common chat and group chat. That‚Äôs maybe missing there [deleted] Telegram is not only about privacy and security. It is also about features"

Note: the voice messages aren't styled yet on the extension, as it would require playing the messages to analyze the waveform. Let me know if it's a feature you'd like to have! well im first user so sweet Works on Microsoft edge too but not perfectly. Epic. Thanks for your work Thank you!!!! Wow, thanks man, looks awesome!! I agree with what Madison has to say! wow, amazing dude, gonna try it tomorrow Awesome work That epic dude! 
Thanks for that! Looks good This is very nice. I used to run an internal script with Temper monkey, which did a lot of color negatives. Well it was easy to do but had it's glitches and was not that nice

Thank you for your open source project I'm liking it so far, but opening message info of one of your messages (to see who has read your message in a group chat) could use a little bit of work. Other than that (and the corners, which you are already addressing) I really like it! The text color for me is black instead of white like in your screenshot. That is some sweet elegant redesigning! I like it :) 

Maybe a suggestion: Adding an on-off-switch so one do not need to delete the Add-On for looking into the message details. I really liked it in the beginning, but now it has become outdated. I also use Edge, what are the issues it has? > opening message info of one of your messages
Thanks! There are hidden sections that haven't been addressed yet by this theme, as I wanted first to see if users liked it (imagine re-skinning everything at the beginning only to see it has zero downloads). Consider it a beta version for now. I'll be adding more details as I see the number of installations increase, and feedback like yours. You need to enable the official Dark theme in WhatsApp first. Go to Settings > Theme > Dark. >so one do not need to delete the Add-On for looking into the message details.

Thanks! Not sure what you mean by that.

Would you provide more details or a screenshot? Whatsapp web doesn't looks same as that screenshot. I have that enabled in the app but it doesn't parallel WhatsApp Web, which shows the Light theme. The problem is, that with the add-on, it is not possible to look into message details. Because the details feature is used so rarely, you could implement an on/off button:  
[https://imgur.com/a/rMXMfs2](https://imgur.com/a/rMXMfs2) (a piece of art made in GIMP).   
With this you can switch between the old and new design - So if more features are added in the future, you do not need to implement them all in the add-on but switch between the designs for using them.  


If it is more easily to implement the message details feature in the add-on, do not bother and simply ignore me :) Could you provide a screenshot please? If many users need it for Edge (chromium), I could try to adapt it. I believe you're saying that you've enabled Dark theme on your phone and you're expecting the web app to change as well.

You need to enable Dark theme on web separately. Here, take a look: [https://youtu.be/9J9RufSrHCI?t=40](https://youtu.be/9J9RufSrHCI?t=40) >it is not possible to look into message details

Here's a screenshot of how to access the Message Info panel: [https://i.imgur.com/zQmxTgE.png](https://i.imgur.com/zQmxTgE.png)

&#x200B;

I'm still not sure what you mean, so I'll give you a multiple choice to move forward:

A) The dropdown button inside the message is not visible/working.

B) The context menu is not visible/working when you click the dropdown button.

C) The Message Info panel is not showing up.

&#x200B;

Which one of those are you referring to?  https://imgur.com/aA2qsBK Oh I didn't know. Thanks. That is very strange - In my version, the message info panel (so case C) did not show up after clicking on the context button. I assumed, that it was not implemented/redesigned (thought, I read it in a comment above). I just reinstalled the add-on and it suddenly appeared. I see. The reason why it doesn't look the same is that your screen is too small. The resolution of your notebook is 1366x768. The resolution of my design is 1920x1080. [deleted] Alright, but that round edge (on my screen) looks shit, can you make it such that the round edge goes away when using it on a small screen. That's true. I updated the extension to show rounded borders for the main panel only when the resolution is greater than 1440 pixels wide.
It's already available in Firefox and awaiting review from the Chrome team. >looks shit

Woah dude! That came out a bit strong, haha. But the criticism is valid. This weekend I'll update the extension to hide the rounded corners in smaller screens. He's doing it for free."

Currently, archiving a chat allows you to mute the conversion. However, upon receiving a new message brings the chat to the top, which is entirely inadequate for users who want to shush the conversation for some time.¬†

- Often when typing fast, WhatsApp gets laggy so I have to be patient and type slowly. I thought this had to do with Gboard but WhatsApp is the only app where I experience this with.

Why does WhatsApp massively reduce the quality of Videos and Pictures sent through chat, I dont understand why, its the worst I've seen on any app or social service does anyone have any answers or suggestions about this.;13;i91f3c;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i91f3c/why_does_whatsapp_massively_reduce_the_quality_of/;12;"Is this just poor android optimization? 

Is it the same on ios ?";2020-08-13 18:00:00;"Because thankfully they realise that 99% of the world don't know a bloody thing about file types, file sizes and compression, and if they didn't do this then you would be waiting for a 90mb picture of someone's dinner via your mobile data. If you want to share an image or video without compression then use ""Document"" as type when attaching.  File compression, its something they're not too good at.... Honestly I prefer it this way.

Most media people share are kind useless (no offence), considering how overpowered are phone cameras these days and that no one considers whether that pic of their frickin feet or whatever really needs to be seen in 4k, our device storage would be constantly full.

P.S.: No wonder they can handle so many users with such little team and costs, they cut costs on literally everything (quite impressive, such clever foxes, if you ask me).

But I also blame them for not informing about that. If you want to send big files you're better off using a cloud service (Google Drive, Mega...) or some file sending service. I think they aren't bothered with improving the compression quality because it's a non-issue as WhatsApp is a messaging app not a photography app and there are countless other websites/apps available for high-quality images. Don't totally blame WhatsApp, you can always send media with fulll resolution by sending them as documents (i know you won't always want to do that). But they should provide some options in settings to set compression level desired by us. Don't blame WhatsApp, blame Facebook. Some years ago everything was full size but in the last few years they have started to massively cause compression, now you can barely get a video through anymore How didn't I know this before lol thanks everyone üëç its a punishment for using such a horrible messaging application Very well said üëè But do you agree the quality could be better ?

What's the chances of Whatsapp unbanning me?;2;i902ww;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i902ww/whats_the_chances_of_whatsapp_unbanning_me/;10;"I woke up a couple days ago to the fact that Whatsapp had banned my phone number. I requested that they reconsider and received the following message back from them:


""We have reason to believe your account activity has violated our Terms of Service and decided to keep your account banned. We received a large number of complaints about your account and in order to protect our users' privacy, we won't disclose the nature of the complaints.

Responses to this email thread won't be read.""


I have reason to believe that someone/s decided they didn't like me and bulk reported my number.

I emailed the general support address and requested them to look into it again. Any chance they might reverse their decision? If not, what are my options as most of my friends, family, and a lot of business contacts primarily use Whatsapp to communicate?

*Edited for formatting.";2020-08-13 16:39:38;"My business account just got banned out of nowhere. No warnings nothing. Dont see what I did wrong. I run a clothing business. All of my thousands of contacts and chats and messages gone, just like that.

This is quite ridiculous. What was the reason they gave you?

I'm actually not concerned about my contacts and chats. My contacts were all on my Google account, and I didn't have any chats that had to be kept. I was lucky from that standpoint.

The question is what now? Will a new phone number and phone allow a person to make a new account? If that works, for me it may be easier to change phone numbers than go without Whatsapp.

That won't help you any though... Just that terms and services were violated.

Sent an email to support. Doubt they will do anything. You don't need a new phone, you just need a new number.

Get a new number and register it to whatsapp, then all your contacts and your previous chat history with them will remain. You can see all your previous chats, and message your contacts, but you can't message in groups. Just inform all your contacts which are important to you that you changed your number. >but you can't message in groups.

What exactly do you mean by this? Simply that I won't be part of my old groups because of the new number? Or something else? Yes, but if you want to join back just ask an admin to add your new number in. Awesome! I'm going to get a new number, new phone, and delete all my old messages out of abundance of caution. There really are very few that I need to keep anyway, and I'll just live without those few. You don't need a new phone for changing numbers though, you could just replace your number on the old phone Ya I know. I really want a new phone anyway so why not?"

I was told yesterday that there is a program called dr. fone that can migrate the chats from one system to another.

The thing is that now I have several years on my old phone and 12 months on the new one.

Does anybody know if it would be possible to merge both history logs? (I still own my old phone)

Thanks in advance.";2020-08-12 21:19:41;"[removed] [removed] I don't know if drfone can merge the messages but another program named Backuptran Android WhatsApp to iPhone Transfer can merge both the old and new messages perfectly in iPhone. You can have a try. You can't do that from Android to iOS :( Whatsapp on iOS only backups from and to iCloud. Thanks a lot. This was the answer for me.

I've merged my Android and iOS chat logs in my computer, now I just have to write them to my iPhone.

Thanks again. [removed] I sent you a message. Please see that. You mean drfone can do the merging? Or did you use another method? Thanks, but I don't think it'd work. Anyway, I'm interested in merging both databases, if I did that I'd be stuck just with the first one. I used the Backuptrans one. 

Two days ago I did the same for my mom and it also worked. 

Caveats:

-	It's not cheap. I had to buy a new license because every license is only good for three devices.
-	Depending on the size of your database, the process may be quite slow. My mom had 150,000+ messages and it took more than an hour.
-	Make sure you have plenty of room on your computer. You have to preload the Android Whatsapp database (25 GB for my mom‚Äôs phone), copy it to a local database and then the process to copy it to the iPhone makes another copy... It won‚Äôt warn you before hand, it will fail when the process is about to finish.
-	Make sure to follow all the instructions: disable this, enable that, uninstall whatever, reboot this other thing... Read every step carefully and don‚Äôt miss anything. It will fail and you‚Äôll have to start the copy again.

Despite all of the above, I‚Äôm really happy with the end result. Messages, photos and videos are copied flawlessly. Whatsapp was the only thing tying me to Android / iOS and now I can jump from one to another without loosing anything. So Wonderhare's Dr.Fone doesn't work for merging backups? In my case I have both backups in iPhones. I'm sorry I can't help you, I ended using the other program."

So did Whatsapp really support Edge or not...? I use microsoft edge stable version  84.0.522.59 and I can use whatsapp web without any problems.. It‚Äôs because edge is for Xbox aswell, that means that they need to make a version for Xbox a for it to work Move to Telegram desktop ;) Check if JavaScript is enabled The new edge is supposed to be chromium based, even with Google‚Äôs help Edge is pretty bad lol The Microsoft Edge browser they've listed is the old version. They probably support that. The logo (& the browser) have updated since, to the one you're using.

I recommend the WhatsApp Windows App btw. Works pretty good. I think its a bug, I use whatsapp web on the updated(release version) chromium edge, it works fine. WhatsApp does support Edge, both the legacy version and the new one.

Then I just start OBS, then Tools -> Start Virtual Camera, and then set Chrome's default camera to ""OBS Virtual Camera"" (Chrome camera setting -> chrome://settings/content/camera).

Then in OBS simply add a new Scene (bottom-left), add a Source to that Scene (chose ""Image"" source) and pick the image I want to share. You can move the image around and/or zoom it to just how you want to share it on Whatsapp.

Then finally in Whatsapp web, hit the paperclip icon to share something, pick the camera icon and you should see your image. Just press the camera icon to take a snap shot and send it!

b.After clicking the three dot click on settings

Animated stickers not working anymore;1;i77yim;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i77yim/animated_stickers_not_working_anymore/;1;Hi! I managed to create some whatsapp animated stickers that worked fine for 2 weeks, but today when I tried to send them, whatsapp told me that the file were too big. The problem is that they were the same amount of weight in the past days (when they worked) and I haven't changed anything. What could've happened?;2020-08-10 19:21:58;"[deleted] You gotta have 2 mobile phones. Let's say Mobile 1 and Mobile 2.

Mobile 1 must send a sticker that Mobile 2 is never going to use, since that sticker is going to be replaced.

Then, Mobile 2 download a gif from giphy and convert that gif into webp file (look on the internet for that).

Now Mobile 2 move the webp file from download to the whatsapp stickers folder. Here there's the sticker that mobile 1 has sent you and you gotta copy the name of this sticker and then delete it.

Now paste the name of the deleted sticker to the webp file you imported in the folder and close every whatsapp from background.

Now you open whatsapp, go to the chat with mobile 1 and see that the sticker that's been sent to you has been replaced. You save it in your favorite messages and now you got an animated sticker!"

Can't Force Stop WhatsApp;1;i6p8uk;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i6p8uk/cant_force_stop_whatsapp/;1;"Okay, I mean, yes, technically I can go through the steps and click Force Stop, and it APPEARS to be stopped... Until I get another message on there. Then I get a notification again.

The Why:

I'm in several very active WhatsApp groups with nearly constant activity. I'm aware of the ""Mute Group for X time"" option, but I don't always know how long I'll need it silenced, and I'd like to start getting notifications again whenever I'm ready to receive them.

The Want:

I want to be able to force close WhatsApp and not get any notifications until I manually reopen the app. I don't want to have to individually mute each group for a limited length of time (especially as there are only three options, with the shortest being 8 hours).

Why doesn't the app stay closed? Is there something simple I'm missing that will fix that?

The Specs:

Google Pixel 3XL, WhatsApp version 2.20.196.16, Android 10.";2020-08-09 22:18:23;"WhatsApp is a messaging app and so is set to automatically start when you start your phone and when a message comes in. Like with the dialler, you can‚Äôt stop it from working. 

Depending on your handset you might have the option to stop it auto-starting when your phone switches on. 

Regarding, notifications (because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs really disturbing you) depending which version of Android you have, you‚Äôll be able to disable them or possibly even disable them for a time. It might be as easy as swiping a notification to the left and selecting a cog or clock icon. Failing that will be in App info, under Notifications."
Whatsapp verification reset timer?;2;i6oqq3;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i6oqq3/whatsapp_verification_reset_timer/;1;"Hi,

I recently switched from iOS to Android. Because I didn't wanted to lose my WA chat history, I used a tool called WazzapMigrator to transfer my chats to my new device. Unfortunately, it took a few tries causing me to having reinstall WA several times, resulting in WA suspending me and sending me verification codes only after 48 hours. 

48 hours have passed, I'm able to get back in WA, but it's an older version (2.18.248, this version was used to convert the iOS backup). In this version, I'm not able to start chats or even reply in active chats. The Google Play store doesn't say WA needs an update, so the only option is to uninstall my current WA and to download the latest version in the Google Store.

My fear is that WA is going to suspend my account again (now for 96 hours) because of too many verification attempts in a short amount of time. So here I am asking if someone here have past experiences with this issue and has a proper solution? What is the waiting time for Whatsapp to release/reset my 'verification attempt time span'?";2020-08-09 21:51:43;Have the same issue....did you get around to it or did you just wait?

Whatsapp new update 2020 | 3 major improvements this year;0;i6iehw;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i6iehw/whatsapp_new_update_2020_3_major_improvements/;1;"# Whatsapp last updates were concerned about eye safety (Dark Mode) and to increase the number of participants for an Ongoing video call. This time WhatsApp new update will focus on 3 major things, Self-deleting messages, Mute Archive Group Chats forever and Whatsapp image search on the web

Whatsapp a company started in the year 2009 with few users, today has around a billion users on this Text messaging app, Whatsapp was cofounded by **Jam Koum** and **Brian Acton.** In the year 2014 **WhatsApp** was sold to **Facebook** for 19 Billion Dollars.

Whatsapp brought many features such as WhatsApp Calling, Whatsapp  Video Calling, Dark Mode, Qr code to add a contact directly, Themes,  Two-step verification and much more.

But currently, **WhatsApp new update** is testing for 3 major features which are thoroughly tested in **Beta mode**.

&#x200B;

* **Auto deleting messages**
* **Mute Archive group Chats forever**
* **Whatsapp image search on Web**

## Let‚Äôs read more on upcoming Whatsapp new update features ‚Äì

&#x200B;

1. **WhatsApp Auto deleting messages:**

&#x200B;

On an average 65 Billion messages are sent per day worldwide and 29  Million messages per minute. (a report from May 2018). Year by Year the statistics are growing and storing all messages of every user is not possible, So the team of WhatsApp decided to go with this feature.

**Whatsapp Self-deleting message** or you may call **Auto deleting a message** is an **upcoming Whatsapp update** which will delete your **messages** in a **week** from personal as well as group chats. According to **Whatsapp beta**, there will be a window of **7 days** your messages will be visible to you and after that, all the old messages will be **removed** regularly.

For group chats, the rights for this feature will be available for the **admins** of the group only.

As of now, this feature is only being tested with text messages, But in the upcoming days, it can be suitable for **Images**, **Videos**, **Gif** and **stickers** as well.

The only way we can save old messages is via Screenshot or **WhatsApp Star message feature.**¬†Coz star message can be deleted manually only.

[Do you know you can store all your important documents on your phone ‚Äì Read here how](https://www.blogsbarrel.com/digi-locker-application/)

2\*\*.¬†Mute group Archive chats forever:\*\*

Let‚Äôs agree to the fact that some family or office groups have the highest number of unwanted messages from Good Morning to Good night messages. Even though we mute this we still we can see the number of messages unread on a group chat. Even if we archive the whole chat after muting the group, one new message on the group and the chat is back to the front page of WhatsApp.

Muting group Archive chats forever will be a big relief for those who can‚Äôt exit the group and doesn‚Äôt care about new messages arriving in the group Because all of them will be hidden in the Archive folder and won‚Äôt show on the front page on WhatsApp. But according to me, there will be a limit for this feature as you won‚Äôt be allowed to Mute and archive all group chats. There will be a limit of 1 group or a maximum of 2, this WhatsApp update will be quite useful for everyone.

3. **Whatsapp Image search on the web:**¬†

Fake images roam everywhere on the net whether political rumour or controversy. Internet is open a free for everyone, anyone can make an image and post it online. There are lots of examples for this such as

:Check images in below link 

 [https://www.blogsbarrel.com/whatsapp-new-update-2020/](https://www.blogsbarrel.com/whatsapp-new-update-2020/)

So to avoid this type of news WhatsApp is building an algorithm which  will detect if the Image is real or fake, And if fake the image will be  tagged as Fake, Like Whatsapp does with the forwarded message header  tag. This feature will help us to decide to either share it or not.

These are the 3 upcoming features to Whatsapp, But as of now all are  in Testing phase and will be launched in this year. The announcement was  made in the year 2019, So it‚Äôs quite possible these features will be  rolled out in WhatsApp new update.

 That was all for **Whatsapp new features** if you liked this post do share it. ";2020-08-09 15:18:21;All of the 3 new ‚Äúmajor‚Äù updates already in Telegram ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Separating group and individual chats;8;i64nhf;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i64nhf/separating_group_and_individual_chats/;6;This is a feature request. How good would it be if we could just separate group and individual chats? Some people have so many not-that-important groups and they need to weed them out from the important individual chats. Thanks!;2020-08-08 21:59:21;Yeah, that'd be cool, they could just do it like Telegram does. Introduce folders and let people sort groups, personal chats, work chats. It would be great. Possible with modded whatsapps. World should use the beauty of Telegram, start by making the change because WhatsApp company doesn‚Äôt really care about users... :( Modded apps are a risk to getting your account banned the problem of monopoly I guess.

How does WhatsApp know if I already received a certain file?;6;i620pd;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i620pd/how_does_whatsapp_know_if_i_already_received_a/;3;"A friend of mine sent me a couple of pictures yesterday and one of them happened to be something that he had already sent me long before so when I got those two images, one of them was already there _(my auto-download is off btw)_ but the other one was not. I had to download that one.

I am curious as how WhatsApp knows if I already have a pic because as far as I know there is no metadata involved in sending images so how does the app recognizes that a certain picture is already present in the device?";2020-08-08 19:31:06;File name might be the same The image he sent you before is the same image he sent to you again, likely using the forward feature. When forward is used, instead of manual upload, the image is retrieved from WhatsApp's servers instead of the sender's phone. This way WhatsApp is able to know and make duplicate images appear as a single one. filename

Suddenly have an annoying beeping sound when I leave my video call on Android (Samsung Galaxy S10e);1;i5t7s2;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i5t7s2/suddenly_have_an_annoying_beeping_sound_when_i/;5;Whenever I make a video call my phone makes a picture within a picture so I can still see the person and do other things on my phone. I used to be able to close that window, which would pause my video, and I could still speak to the person I'm talking to. Recently when I close the window to do something else on my phone I started to hear this loud beeping noise. The noise stops my conversation and the person on the other end can't hear me, instead they hear the beeping. Once I go back to WhatsApp the beeping stops. Any idea how to make this stop? The person on the other end says that when this happens their WhatsApp app says my video is paused but they can't hear me and they hear the beeping until I come back.;2020-08-08 07:47:54;One of my parents has this problem. We're still trying to figure out the answer, but will post it here if we find one. Would like to see if anyone has solved this. Thanks. I just switched to Duo for video calls. The people at WhatsApp said it's normal. Haven't tried using it for video calls in a couple months. Wonder what they mean by normal? Did they tell you what it means? I'll suggest Duo to my parents, then. Thank you ^^ They basically said they made changes and that's one of them. Idk if they'll fix it in the future but that's what they told me Okay, thanks

Next time, make sure you finish backing up whatsapp on your previous phone before wiping. I did. WhatsApp made a backup every night.

The weird thing is that I got all my recent pictures but not the messages Okay. Have you tried reseting the app? The integration of Google drive into WhatsApp is buggy."

This annoying shit has been possible for years. I tried spamming this ""invisible"" unicode char. somewhere else (facebook I think) and they detect characters like this and block you from spamming them. Meanwhile Whatsapp doesn't seem to care. It will be fixed, in all likelihood, but new messages like that pop up all the time. The first time it happened in WhatsApp was like 10 years ago. They just change the text and it has to be fixed again. Fuck dude.

Looking for advice (problems relating to multiple SIM cards);1;i4vf4l;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i4vf4l/looking_for_advice_problems_relating_to_multiple/;0;"Hello everyone,

¬†I've run into problems with retrieving my backed up conversations upon changing sim-cards.

Background: I'd been using WhatsApp on my personal phone and sim for a while, with online backups to Google drive enabled.

Long story short, six months ago I was given a company sim intended to be used abroad upon arrival. I inserted this new company sim into my phone, switched numbers within the app and continued using WhatsApp with no issues for a moment (with my own chats intact), but then I realized that conversations from the previous user of this sim-card had also appeared. Apparently, the contacts of this former user of the believed that she had been hacked, and upon hearing my story, certain individuals were encouraging me to delete my account, as well as to get rid of those old messages. I was told that since I had made multiple backups in the past I would be able to restore my messages, as I wasn‚Äôt using my personal sim card at that time.¬†

So I did the following as per their instructions:¬†

- Delete my account (whilst using company sim)

- Reinsert personal sim and restore backed up conversations.¬†

- Reinsert company sim and switch numbers within the app as usual.¬†

That turned out not to work, however. The application kept telling me that no backup was found. I tried reinstalling the app, but was told that no backup was found at that point, but also that my Google account ""had already been associated with WhatsApp"".
Since I‚Äôm using an Android phone, i tried locating a locally stored backup file, but found nothing, also tried deleting cache files from the application and reinstalling the app, but to no avail.¬†


Now six months later, I'm getting messages from strangers, presumably due to other people using that company sim.

Besides that I would really appreciate being able to restore my old chats and conversations, as they are of great personal and sentimental value to me.¬†

Sincerely hope you can help, it would mean the world to me.¬†

tl:dr = inserted new sim, changed numbers within the app, previous users' contacts, chats etc were still there, deleted that account, tried to reinsert old SIM and restore chats and switch back over again, didn't work. Now getting messages from strangers 6 months later.";2020-08-06 19:53:53;

Instead of spending $8 a month on a WhatsApp bot. interested! i'll dm Can you please enlighten us how you created a bot on WhatsApp? How can one make a WhatsApp bot? What do you use? Hey! The Whatsapp bot is $4/month. Yes, we understand there are free alternatives, but none of those  worked for me or for our users. Specifically, on most reminders apps (like Apple's), creating a reminder takes too long. This makes the user prefer not write the reminder out and sometimes forget about it. Sure! We're using the Twilio Whatsapp API That's really cool, wondering how did you parse the timing

Did you hand code finding ""at"" ? What If I say ""tomorrow morning"" ? Is there any library that you are using to parse the time out of the message ?
Thx :) really cool project Hey, thanks for the encouragement :). We are using Google's Dialog Flow API. It's quite good at understanding most things with just a few bugs."

A few of my contacts have changed phone numbers, I only noticed because they weren't looking at my status,so I went into a chat where i had messaged with them, and there is a little blurb telling me they changed numbers. So I updated their numbers, they told me they had sent out a status update to let their contacts know they have a new number, but no one ever saw it. Best way I think that would work is to message all of your contacts to let them know you now have a new number."

UI is completely overhauled, and full instructive documentation on the site 

entire project will be made open source next week. 

feedback and feature requests welcomed well, i see you marked it as beta, so guess it got work

but I would make the instruction for automation (chrome extension, and the settings for it, including json file) more accessible, instead of hiding it in the html 

and can't figure out how to use the broadcast on mobile.. it only loads the first number, then stops... good idea, definitely on my list of things, making clear instructions (maybe video coming soon)

To do broadcast on mobile, you need to keep the web app running (can't be in background),

 the only way I've been able to do that - so far - is by putting the phone in split screen mode with the whatsapp. Android only. for iOS maybe someone else has ideas. 

using the mobile broadcast will go much faster than desktop once I get the ui click automated. Until then, only desktop with Chrome ext is fully automated."

Hi,

Did anyone else experience this ?After using Whatsapp successfully on Mac OS for 6 years without any update or change in OS version, it suddenly stopped working yesterday. When you launch the app, it opens but the Whatsapp window never appears.

*Is this the intented behaviour Whatsapp team concluded was the best to offer to its users to keep them from switching to another messenger ?*

I've tried deleting the app and its files in ""Application support"" and re-installing from the whatsapp website from scratch, for now nothing is happening.

Whatsapp 2.2031.4 with Mac OS 10.10.5 (running on this OS perfectly for 6 years, did not update whatsapp nor anything else lately)

Any ideas ? Thanks!";2020-08-04 15:04:12;"Yeah i got the same thing. Downloaded the dmg from the Whatsapp website and did a reinstall, didn't work.

Finally got it back running by deleting all associated files with Appcleaner and installing an *older* version from the Appstore (that did not work with the dmg, which is a generation newer). Same here in ireland just stopped working Same problem. I tried uninstalling with App Cleaner and downloading from the Appstore, didn't work, and it didn't work from the dmg version on WhatsApp site either.... argh. Ok for everyone: 

I managed to download an old version (for mac) from here:  
[https://whatsapp-desktop.en.uptodown.com/mac/versions](https://whatsapp-desktop.en.uptodown.com/mac/versions)  
I used this version: 2.2019.6  
and it worked.....(after uninstalling using Appcleaner)  
Here are versions for Windows:   
[https://whatsapp-desktop.en.uptodown.com/windows/versions](https://whatsapp-desktop.en.uptodown.com/windows/versions) Wow glad you found a solution that worked for you ! So you can pick on the appstore which version you want to download ? üòµ Ahoy Sandjensen11! Nay bad but me wasn't convinced. Give this a sail:

Same problem. me tried uninstalling wit' App Cleaner n' downloading from thar Appstore, didn't duty, n' it didn't duty from thar dmg version on WhatsApp site either.... argh. This worked. Thank you üëçüèª No, the AppStore version is just older than the dmg version on their site, and was the one that worked. I tried what you did, and it did not work. Maybe it's due to the fact that the app store version has been updated August 3rd so they managed to doom that version too. How do they manage such obvious mistakes at their scale baffles me. do you happen to still have that .dmg by any chance ?! I think it just become very precious...

I used prepaid for Whatsapp account, what happens when someone else does same in future?;6;i3dmyr;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i3dmyr/i_used_prepaid_for_whatsapp_account_what_happens/;11;Couple years ago I made Whatsapp account with prepaid. Account still exist but my prepaid expired already. Soon this same prepaid number will be recycled to someone else. What would happen to my account if they create Whatsapp account with it?;2020-08-04 08:37:48;"The best you can do is, delete the account yourself if you are still using it, or better use the change phone number to the new number for which you have the sim. Same goes for every other app. We have so many apps and all requires an OTP to login. Never use a number which you don't have anymore, could have serious consequences. The new prepaid owner could access your old WhatsApp account by performing a login reset by SMS. They will not see your old messages but they can see your name, profile picture, group chats that the account is still a member of, status, blocked numbers, numbers hidden from viewing your status, and broadcast messages.

There is nothing you can do. The number is now owned by someone else. You should just inform your friends and whoever that still have your old number to delete it.

Additionally, you could talk to the new user and inform them about the status quo to prevent misunderstanding.

Alternatively, you could go to your operator's office and try to get the old number once again before anyone else buys it or in fact you could work out a deal with the new owner to retrieve your old number. im having this exact same problem right now. luckily for me, the guy is quite understanding, so I can get my account back.   
but to answer that, your account data will migrate to his phone. i think they get the messages that people send to that account . you should disable the account tho What kind of consequences? I use this number as throwaway number for gaming and social media profiles (which doesn‚Äôt contain my real info). I don‚Äôt contact any irl friends via this number This is prepaid number that I use to chat online strangers that I meet occasionally in some gaming groups or some webaccounts that needed phone number to register. For example, game achievement huntings and alternative social media profile (which doesn‚Äôt contain my real info). This is why I used prepaid number because none of my personal info is tied to it (for irl contacts I use real number). Is there any privacy consequences in this, so that new user could find out my real identity via whatsapp? Is it true, that the old conversations won‚Äôt migrate to his phone? Otherwise I like to continue using this since it is my throwaway number I hope this is not true... :( Well for starters, suppose If I got the recycled number, I would log in WhatsApp. I receive messages that were sent to you while it was closed, I could pretend and continue talking. Maybe your online gaming community or fans, friends know something more, maybe they trusted you, so I ask for  money, I can scam, endless possibilities depending on person and your community.(This can be done even by a person who is not so technically sound)

Some apps and social media store the last device info. Your last location, maybe you put that number in your email, with smartphones lot of things are connected to a mobile number and lots of info are shared with google. If you used in any one of them you never know. (This can be done by technically sound people)

Throwaway numbers are a security risk for you and more so for the people with whom you contact with that number. Always Avoid, unless you know what you are doing. Probably none but they could access your WhatsApp groups if you're still in them. If not, there's nothing to worry about. Old messages are gone forever. yep... he wont get ur conversation history"

Yesterday R posted a status on their story which I was able to view, however at that same time I was not able to see R‚Äôs profile photo or last seen status.

When I tried to download an earlier version (non beta) of WhatsApp it says it cannot read the backup file

HELP!

Android 11 Beta 2.5
WhatsApp Version 2.20.197.6";2020-08-03 08:09:50;"I faced exactly the same thing 2 days ago.
I tried everything. It cant restore from local backup and gets stuck at 100 percent from drive backup. If I minimize and reopen the app it says it's restoring the message but on opening i see nothing but the group I'm added in. Nothing else. Entirely blank. 
It's possible that your google drive backup was corrupted. Has to be a beta issue. Just installed Android 11 beta 2 and got hit with this as well. Back to Android 10 that's not kool :(
I managed to download the backup and media onto my PC
still looking into solutions to merge it with the current version cuz that's 4 years of WhatsApp were you able to restore your backup on Android 10? Somewhat same bro. My media files are safe, thank God. But how did you download the whatsapp backup ?? No I managed to get the media too, it's on my PC
I downloaded it using an app called Elcomsoft Explorer for WhatsApp

you login with your google account and it downloads the files for you

the funny thing is they ask you to pay 80$ to extract the media which is already available in the System files of windows in exactly the same format as a standard WhatsApp backup

I copied it safely but it didn't restore on the phone sadly, always fails at 16-18% If you faced the same issue, Were you able to restore your chats? What is the name of the file that you downloaded? If it is something like msgstore.db.crypt then there might be some way. However if your google drive backup is corrupted, sorry but there is no away you can restore your older chat from cloud. Please check if you can extract the key file from your phone so you can decrypt the encrypted msgstore.db file. I personally wasn't . Went back to ten and no issues . Yes I have that msgstore.db.crypt
I'm not sure it's corrupted, I think it's just a beta issue

I'm trying to see if I can merge it with another similar file that has no issue but so far no luck what's that and how do you do it? So you're saying you upgraded your android version and this issue occured so you went back to the previous version and this issue was gone? Is that what you're tryna say? Try this way maybe it might help. 
First delete the whatsapp folder. Reinstall the app but dont open it. Move the downloaded file into an empty  database folder of whatsapp. Keep the name as msgstore.db.crypt. if there is any date mentioned, rename and remove it. Now open whatsapp and turn off data or wifi connection, let whatsapp find local backup. If it is still unable to restore your chats, sorry but you tried the last possible way and now you can do nothing but move on That's what I am saying. Tried it three times and every time same thing did that twice actually
once on the beta and once on the non beta

thanks for trying man but it seems the chat history only exists on an encrypted broken file ... So you weren't able to restore your chats Guess we'll both have to move on from our chats Not as able as your momma

I have an at&t unlimited data plan here in the USA and need to make a few calls to another WhatsApp user in Australia and Scotland. Will I be charged for making a voice call with WhatsApp while  on  mobile data (NOT WIFI)?  I ask because I've read conflicting reports, some say no because whatapp uses data not whatever is used when a normal call it made and other day it's possible that what's app calls could be routed as voice calls on a normal cell tower.;2020-08-03 06:13:30;"No. If you're using WhatsApp, all the data will be gone through WhatsApp servers, and you'll not be using the voice call protocol of your mobile service provider.

Just to expand the answer, you may be mixing with the VoWiFi protocol, which actually uses the voice call protocol, but routes it over WiFi. It will be charged as a voice call, but WhatsApp uses data, NOT call. 

Gist: you will be charged for data, but not as a call. So the WhatsApp call would be data from my unlimited data plan . Ok thank you Yes."

Otherwise you could fabricate the context of a conversation. Actually, the reason why whatsapp maintains the 'deleted' dialog just to bring in accountability. It tries to bring a sense of responsibility to the user so that they'll watch what they're speaking, just like real life.

Technically, it is possible for whatsapp to delete the entire message from the recipient's phone. This is clear from the fact that WhatsApp has permissions to delete files from your phone, it deletes the media from your file storage when a media message is deleted.

The problem is more about ethics than feasibility or convenience. because its not cloud based like telegram Point. Agreed, like Instagram you can unsend a message. They should do this You‚Äôre right, people have tried faking the context of a chat to their convenience as evidence on trials that involve the use of screenshots or phone messages This is an outdated form of App design logic. App design should push the convenience envelope over trying to police people's behavior. If your App design doesn't enforce ethics on its own then by definition your App is unethical.

Imagine telling people they can't delete a typo on a word document because that way they'll make less mistakes and be more accountable. That's a very good point. But naturally, a question arises which is, how do we differentiate between a typo and a case of unethical conversation?

First, the technology we have hasn't evolved that much to differentiate the difference since the number of languages used to communicate on WhatsApp is fairly large. Secondly, even if it does reach, how would the program reading through our message affect the privacy of our life?

I would say that right now, we're in a grey area where the technology is reaching that point, but privacy rules are still under a lot of uncertainty. The chaos should settle for the light to be seen. Until then, we cannot prescribe how apps should handle ethics on the user side when the app itself can be perceived unethical in some way."

Only after i SMS'd them, asking ""why aren't you replying"" , then suddenly my messages became double ticked";2020-08-01 14:38:58;"Not really. If there are two ticks that r not blue then it means that he/she has opened the app and has just not seen ur text Offline that way as in they r probably just turning off their WiFi no it's only a single tick, only after I sms'd her/him, then suddenly both my private and my group message became double tick (because he/she was the last one to receive message), it's like she/he just allowed the messages to be delivered, but i read somewhere if you block someone and then you unblock them you won't be able to see past sent messages.

so the previous private message sent suddenly becoming double ticked at the same time is a bit strange to me. But with data plan they can receive right? Alright that explains everything I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case U could just see when he/she was online and if it‚Äôs after. Then he/she is probably ignoring u. If they have blocked u then ur messages never go to the double tick stage ie they never even get delivered If u were blocked and sent a person a message than it will show 1 tick, even after that person unblocks you.
Also, if someone blocked u and u talked in a group you 2 have in common, the person can still see ur messages. The person was probably not connected to the internet. Provided they have mobile data turned on yes Glad to help she/he came online at the same time all the messages (private and group) became double ticked, never seen this case before Yeap the previous commenter explained it, I'm quite clear about, thanks though He/she probably just turns on mobile data, enters WhatsApp and then immediately goes offline.

Why are some messages not delivered at all while some others are?;1;i1ne0e;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i1ne0e/why_are_some_messages_not_delivered_at_all_while/;2;"There is one person I am messaging to, but some messages are not delivered at all for some reason (they have one grey tick) while others are (they have two grey ticks).

Here is the setup: He hasn‚Äôt blocked me at all because I can see his avatar existing. I assume that he also is using the same smartphone all time because his Whatsapp status hasn‚Äôt been updated since December 2019 (the status is custom and not default ones) and he has the same avatar picture since the beginning 2018. So, his avatar is always visible which means he hasn‚Äôt reseted his Whatsapp at all. This person was last online December 2019, then he took long break from Whatsapp (maybe he just turned his phone off) and recently he came back online. My Internet connection has always been great and I can send Whasapp messages to all my other contacts.

Now here is what happened: This person was last online January 2020. In June 2020 I sent him couple of Whatsapp messages, they got one ticks only, which is fine since I believe he had his phone offline since he was last online in January. At the start of July 2020 I sent him again couple pf messages, they all got one grey ticks, which is fine since he still hasn‚Äôt logged in his Whatsapp account. Now fastforward to this day, this person logged in recently (last online yesterday), and as we know, normally at this point all previous one ticks should become two ticks since the message will be delievered successfully once the person has logged in and has Internet access. However, in this case, only July messages got two ticks whereas June messages still have one ticks. This means that the person didn‚Äôt receive my June messages at all.

Why did this happen? I understand that all Whatsapp messages will eventually be sent once the person turn on their phone and has Internet access. But here not all messages was sent at all. Why weren‚Äôt June messages delivered at all, but July messages were? This person was equally offline all time...";2020-08-01 09:01:50;Messages get removed from WA's servers after some time (30 days, iirc). Woah, I didn‚Äôt know that.

Any suggestions on using one drive for WhatsApp backups using the S7?;2020-07-31 21:29:52;[deleted] You can choose to backup your messages onto  your phone storage instead of google drive. Then you will be able to upload the backup files to one drive or even to your computer. Do you have it installed on your phone?  Are you noticing in Google drive under manage apps, it's greyed out? That's normally the way I have it but there's no more room to back up.  I could make some more room and load them to one drive but that's another problem in itself.  When and if using one drive, I believe it saves the back up in an xml format.  If these files are to large, most programs won't be able to open them.  A .text file would be better but again if too large, you won't get it open.

I'd appreciate any insight on this. Thanks.";2020-07-31 18:12:53;"Invite link? Okay. let me take another look and see if someone sent an invite link at some point. Thank you. No this was a manual addition. No invite link was sent. You can see who added, in case of manual addition.

I have seen a few cases of that being not shown, but that was when I was not a member of the group when they were added. No it just says X left 
X joined 
X left
X joined. Nothing about admin added X. Huh. I think it is a case of invite link. When someone is added manually, either 'A added X' or 'X was added' will be shown.

'Joined' usually means invite links. When you join using invite link it says X joined using invite link"

STOP WITH THIS QR CODE;11;i140sb;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i140sb/stop_with_this_qr_code/;17;"I like to use Whatsapp Desktop but I don't like the fact that you need every time (unless you checked ""keep me signed in"" and for my privacy I don't like it) to scan the qr code, it means:

* take your phone.
* go on Whatsapp (and this it's making desktop version useless because in this way I'm already on Whatsapp so I could use it there).
* click the icon where ""Whatsapp Web"" is located and click it.
* scan the code you see on your desktop.

What I mean is, why not let the possibility to make an account like every other social media and messaging apps?

In this way, If my phone would be unavailable or even if I lost it, I wouldn't be able to log on Whatsapp. I know that the system now is on should be more secure but it's unbelievable for me that if I have not my phone and if it isn't connected to the internet I can't use the Whatsapp Desktop.

Let me know if I am wrong/if there is another way to log in.";2020-07-31 11:35:32;"They're working on multi device support. Check out WABetaInfo, he has some articles on it. What if my phone has a broken camera, that's means that you can't use WhatsApp Web... Okay. Just to be clear, when you opt for keep me signed in, you're actually storing the login as cookies. Even in other social media, you use cookies, or a username password authentication. WhatsApp when it started, had a company policy to let people be free from the hassle of remembering passwords. That is the reason they've only has sms based authentication.

Also, if they implement multiple devices, it'll still be cookies, but in different clothes.

What are your thoughts? I hope they really introduce that new update as soon as possible cuz WhatsApp has a habit of taking their sweet time :/ That won't help since it'll still rely on QR codes. Just makes the problem worse, if anything. What if my phone has broken screen ahahaha Isn't there a Desktop app? I think you will be able to create an acc via desktop as well, but we'll see Then you are officially done. :D How would you scan the QR There is, but you gotta scan the QR code also. You just simply can't, I was facing this issue time ago.
And you can't switch to selfie camera even if it's only camera you got. So doesn't it retain the cookies? Sorry, I'm not exactly a fan of web version. I did get your point. I was pointing it out to the person who replied to your comment. Unfortunately no. Got it. Glad to know. I'll stick to Telegram Desktop."

I'm on version 2.20.205.16 Hey, thanks for the reply even though this posts is months old!

I made sure I was updated and had no luck but I did fix it.

I had to backup all my messages in the what's app settings and do some research to make sure all my images, documents, audio messages, etc wouldn't get deleted once I reinstall.

Then I did just that, I cleared the cache, deleted the app, and installed it again. When installing it asked if I'd like to restore my messages which I said yes to, and everything was back to normal. All my conversations were still there with all the messages, pictures, etc. 

The only reason I didn't try a reinstall in the first place was because I was afraid of a backup going wrong or losing all the images.

I learned whatsapp always makes a local backup everyday at 2am. So you'll always have a chance of restoring."

Question Regarding Last seen and WhatsApp Status.;2;i0wttr;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/i0wttr/question_regarding_last_seen_and_whatsapp_status/;7;What are the reasons that a person's last seen is older than his WhatsApp status? For example, her last seen is two weeks ago but the WhatsApp status is one week ago.;2020-07-31 02:36:18;"Doesn't the status only last 1 day? No, the status is the one you see when you enter someone's profile (it is above the phone number). The default one is Hey there, I am using WhatsApp. Yup, they do. OP meant ""About"" The person could've changed it when he/she was offline and it updated when the phone was connected to  the internet.

(The ""Hey there, I am using WhatsApp"" is referred to as ""About"" in WhatsApp. 

""Status Updates"" in WhatsApp are like Instagram's ""Stories"" or Twitter's ""Fleets"". ) Ah I see! Well what if the ""About"" was the default one ""Hey there, I am using WhatsApp"" and it shows as updated but it did not change, it is still ""Hey There, I am using WhatsApp "". Is it more likely that it could be a glitch maybe? Because the person's last seen was about a month ago but the About is a week old and counting as the days pass by. I guess it could be Thank you for the input! :)"

"Does Any one know how to report Whatsapp scammers and unethical hackers on Whatsapp? or How to beat ""Whatsapp Dating Scams?""";2;hzy8ht;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hzy8ht/does_any_one_know_how_to_report_whatsapp_scammers/;6;"I was asked to check out a dating website by a friend, as my background is in security and fraud prevention.  
\-

My friend brought to my attention that this well known dating website appears to have a high percentage of fake people, scammers and hackers! They said no matter how many times they report members to the site they do nothing.  
\-  
Now it appears a number of these scammers masquerade as legitimate females and get men/women to whatsapp! Upon them being invited to whatsapp and forming a early friendship they then send out fake cashapp requests to people they have connected with.  
\-  
Being in security it's obvious to me this is a new form of scam and part phishing as the scammers connect to them via ""Whatsapp"", then use the mobile/telephone number on Whatsapp to submit CashApp money requests to people as opportunistic.  
\-

Now these requests are being sent 3-4 times a week even though these people do not have cashapp.  
\-  
I have told them to take a screen shot of  the whatsapp user details then ask them to ask the person to stop sending requests. Then recommend they report the person and BLOCK them via whatsapp.  
\-  
However the person is still sending multiple requests.  
\-  
Why does Whatsapp not have a category for reporting Scammers and fraud!.  
\-  
If you go to REPORT a user they give you a very basic limited list only.  
\-  
I have also told the person to ignore the cashapp requests as the texts received say ""ACCEPT/DECLINE"", since if they have no account then they must join cashapp to decline. Seems to me that cashapp as no formal method of reporting these transactions or scams, since their customer service is non existent.  
\-  
I'm sure this WHATSAPP user is a scammer  as their security id periodically changes, and they change their number from business to personal, plus change profile information from male to female!  They clearly are working to a scammers blueprint too as their profile is optimised on Whatsapp!  
As such I am certain they will be mass sending to multiple people these requests and gaining the information by Whatsapp and the dating website.  
\-  
I have asked the person to notify the dating site of this, however their form of action is virtually non existent!  
\-  
This also brings to mind why it is so important to be careful when meeting people online and also not sharing personal information to people as the FAKE person doing the scam could also be data mining information to gain money using other methods too!  
\-  
Do you think my best course of action and advice given is suitable, or is there any other ways I can help people to prevent these attacks and scams happening!  
\-  
Do WHATSAPP have a better way of reporting these people like forwarding texts, flagging profiles which are being used to scam?  
\-  
Hopefully by signposting this here I will make people aware of this new form of scamming/phishing being done using whatsapp.

Kind regards-NA

Also the biggest site with the most scammers appears to be ""MINGLE2"", closely followed by;  
SKOUT

MEETME  
I'm sure there may be more though the def volume seems to lie with ""MINGLE2"", many of which can be caught by just checking essential details on GOOGLE, alongwith ""REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH"" just blocked n reported I caught about 50 in a month I don't have time to do it with everyone, the sites should have software integrated to  catch the scammers! agree that's why I logged their numbers so they can be identified in the future by prospective victims. They were not very pleased when I told them I reported them to IC3 and listed them on romance scam sites too! I see, you really took your time to answer üòÇ

WhatsApp IPhone Storage Full - how to fix without losing chat history?;3;hzu6aw;whatsapp;https://dabase.com/blog/2020/WhatsApp-iPhone-Storage-Full/;4;;2020-07-29 07:30:51;"Remove some videos/photos from your iPhone onto your computer to free up more space on iPhone. Or you can backup all chats from iPhone onto icloud or pc first and then reinstall whatsapp messenger. If you find an answer let me know too please üòÖ Not using Whatsapp that doesn‚Äôt care about your storage, but a cloud-based service as Telegram, keep reading anyways:)
One of the 700 very bad things of WhatsApp is, when restore backup, ALL that media (possibly GBs) is taken immediately from your device internal storage!!! Also each time you forward something, it gets duplicated. 
There‚Äôs no solution for this without losing chats and media. How does Telegram work? It downloads messages and media from the cloud when you need it (scrolling up, searching old messages BY DATE, so on). You can also choose to delete that media from your device (not to run out of storage) but everything is available to re-download when needed. Yes, it‚Äôs wonderful. Why we all use WhatsApp? A mystery (I actually know). Start switching your buddies to Telegram and you‚Äôll get that and 400 more incredible features :) Backup your photos and video from whatsapp to the google photos better than icloud after that delete some that seem useless for you and some documents backup it somewhere else"

Ditching WhatsApp is not an option for a lot of people. I can't stop using groups because of the course and also because of my job. Here is what I wrote:

&#x200B;

>Currently, when entering WhatsApp groups, your number is exposed to a lot of unknown people. Groups are necessary for classrooms, job teams, condominium news etc. Avoiding groups is not an option sometimes.  
>  
>Letting a lot of people know your number is dangerous, especially if you don't know them. Privacy is more important than ever nowadays and this should be an option for the user to hide this sensitive data. If a user don't want to keep in touch with someone, it's a right of the user.

It‚Äôs infrastructure related, the way WhatsApp was conceived since the beginning.  If you want to hide your number for non-contacts and many other cool privacy settings, it‚Äôll be easier that you and your contacts move to Telegram, just being honest...

Literally I wasn't do anything in the app except sending and receiving pdf files and some materials about my college to my colleagues and so on. So, the account had a huge number of important materials that I can't have now.
If they believe I violated the terms of services out of no where, why they deleted files from my own phone? Thay could only ban me, but not deleting my own files. That's un fair. whatsapp is not good their algorithm really sucks. did you send those messages to a large number of non-contancts by any chance ? I totally agree with u. The thing is why would they delete files from someone's phone without taking permission or some or at least warning him before, drive me crazy. No, I didn't. I sent them to my contacts only. You could try contacting their support team. They are really lame, but if it's your first time, you might get away with it.

Just be super nice to them and say you apologize for breaking their terms and stuff. Actually I did that bro, but like you said they're lame and thay didn't agree even to give me back my data.

I'm using telegram now. Well that sucks. Same happened to me, but I didn't lose all my data, I just made a new whatsapp number and they gave me back my contacts, stickers, and almost everything."

To double check, J added whatsapp to their work phone and D's account looked like it was deleted because , D's picture was gone, no last seen, and no status. D had a custom status, and not the default ""hey I'm using whatsapp"" or whatever. You can't have a blank status either. 

D never knew J's work cell number, so they could have not blocked them. If D deleted their account, shouldn't it not show up in J's work phone, or does the system actually not delete accounts?";2020-07-26 19:55:07;

Is there any suggestions that I can do to help fix this?

Turning read receipts off and on again. 
Uninstalling and reinstalling the app. 
Force stopping the app after turning read receipts off, and repeating the process after turning it on again.
Restoring the backup twice.

It is just better than whatsapp  You don‚Äôt have to buy paid applications. Try to use MobileTrans as it is free and easy to use. I am writing down the steps for you:  
Step 1: Download MobileTrans and install.  
Step 2: Click on WhatsApp Transfer  
Step 3: Plugin both your iPhone and android to your PC.  
Step 4: Choose the data that you want to transfer and click on transfer.

I am trying to use group texting with about 20-22 individuals. One giant thread. So obviously we have a mix of iPhone and Android. Recently somehow our thread got turned into an iMessage thread and only the iPhone people got it. Sometimes with larger messages some people say they get them in chunks and they are split up. 

Obviously it‚Äôs all frustrating since I‚Äôm kind of in charge. So someone suggested we use WhatsApp. 

So my questions. 

1. Does WhatsApp take the place of your text messaging? Or is just a messaging app outside of your normal SMS and MMS messaging? Similar to iMessage.  We have a very large age range in this group(20s to 70s). I don‚Äôt want to suggest someone download an app and then their normal texting goes through WhatsApp and they call me for tech support. Haha

Thank you!";2020-07-24 22:11:42;"It doesn't take place of your text messaging. And it is very simple to setup, super intuitive. 1. Nah, it's independent from your text messaging and you can use it on any phone without any interference with iMessage or whatever.

2. Setup is easy, you just put in your phone number and make an account. You'll probably have to make the group yourself, if you're the most technically inclined of the bunch. It fits up to 256 people to 20-22 is totally fine. Since your group has some older people, you should warn them that you can't edit messages or delete them after an hour passes, in case someone embarrasses themselves with an accidental message or an inappropriate typo. This kind of stuff is available on other similar apps."

I think that's a bug that needs to be solved by WhatsApp. No idea what's going on there, in my case it uses \~46MB of memory, and most of the time doesn't even register on CPU usage. That's when it's been idle for a while, when in use it seems to consume about 250MB of memory.

Mine is the Windows store version of WA desktop. It‚Äôs incre√≠ble how Facebook with all the money, cannot make native apps for WhatsApp desktop [deleted] I tried and still same problem.

I've tried the export chat option included in WhatsApp itself. It transfers all the photos, videos and audios via Bluetooth to a folder in Windows without a problem. 

My only concern is that the chat itself gets into a TXT file. And when it comes to viewing it, it's kind of annoying, as every time an audio is sent I have to manually look for that audio file in the folder.

What other alternatives do I have? Is there something ""richer"" in terms of UI and multimedia browsing?

What you can do is find a friend who knows little about programming so that he/she can take those TXT files and show it to you in a more readable way, because WhatsApp sucks...

1. Install on iOS & change number in WhatsApp
2. Load backup with an App or something else";2020-07-23 22:08:08;"I recently did this, transferred about 6GB of chat history when I switched from an android to an iPhone.

My suggestion would be that you wait to change your number until after this process of transferring the backup is complete and no you cannot do this with an app. Yes. You need to download a program called Backuptrans Android WhatsApp to iPhone Transfer on your pc for help. No problem to transfer chats from Android to iOS with different phone numbers(whatsapp accounts). iOS uses iCloud for its backup. There‚Äôs no way to transfer the chats and data from android.

Images not downloading in WhatsApp Web that are sent to myself;3;hvvd5v;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hvvd5v/images_not_downloading_in_whatsapp_web_that_are/;2;"For some strange reason, pictures that I send to **myself** do not load, but pictures from other people work fine.

When I send pictures from my iPhone to myself and access them through the Web version of WhatsApp there is a spinning circle and they do not load. Sending images the other way (from the web and accessing WhatsApp on the phone) works fine.

Pictures and media sent to/from other users work without any issue on the phone and the web.

Here are some example screenshots

* Screenshot from WhatsApp iPhone (pictures load fine): [https://i.imgur.com/moSceyt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/moSceyt.jpg)
* Screenshot from WhatsApp Web (spinning wheel): [https://i.imgur.com/tTVy4zE.png](https://i.imgur.com/tTVy4zE.png)
* Screenshot from WhatsApp Web (conversation with someone else - pictures load fine): [https://i.imgur.com/l3AfNGP.png](https://i.imgur.com/l3AfNGP.png)

&#x200B;

Troubleshooting

* I am using Chrome and have disabled adblock altogether with no luck
* The issue also exists when logging in through Firefox and Edge (clean install, no add-ons)
* Upon testing, the WhatsApp Windows is not compatible either
* Sending images to one of my other phone numbers works well in both directions on all platforms

&#x200B;

In conclusion: This only appears to be an issue sending images and pictures to myself on the phone number registered with the account.

Any idea what's happening or can someone point me to a solution?";2020-07-22 18:04:38;did you find a solution? cause i've been having the same problem Only solution I found is to send the message to another phone number that isn't the same one as the account you're logged in under i.e. a Google Talk phone number.

Can I recover my messages from a msgstore.db.crypt12 file without a key?;1;hvsqup;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hvsqup/can_i_recover_my_messages_from_a/;7;"I did a backup of my WhatsApp messages a long time ago (around 3 years) from an Android phone and currently, I don't have any Android device (I'm on an iPhone) and I wanted to know if there is a creative way to recover my WhatsApp messages without having an Android device or the key. 

(I still have the same phone number from 3 years ago when the backup took place).

Thanks";2020-07-22 15:18:10;Yes, but it'll take you a couple of years, with very very powerful computers that aren't commercially available. So actually no. Not easily, at least. Else what would be the point of encryption, if anyone could unencrypt it... I knew why I am asking for a creative way other than crack the encryption haha.. Well, you won't get it from the encrypted database, at least. I thought of running an Android simulator on my machine and install Whatsapp That could work, I think. As long as you put the backup in the right place. It should work but I recommend you get an android device(old or new) for help. Simply put the backup to the Android device, login whatsapp messenger with your old phone number and then restore chats from the backup. After that, you can transfer the chats messages from Android to your iPhone.
YouTube previews not showing up on WhatsApp;77;hvspd6;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hvspd6/youtube_previews_not_showing_up_on_whatsapp/;98;Hi there! When I copy&paste YouTube links on WhatsApp the preview doesn't appear anymore. This problem is happening on the Android app and web version, with [youtube.com](https://youtube.com) and [youtu.be](https://youtu.be) links. I tried a few different video links and it's all the same. Is this happening with anyone else?;2020-07-22 15:15:01;"It's a known bug and it's being worked on, something on YouTube's side. This has happened before, just YouTube messing with the way other services interact with it. Checkout this link for thumbnail preview
Fix : https://youtu.be/JB4BPsYh0mo Same here and I didn't find a fix yet. same, on ios and firefox web version. Iphone too. Might be a bug will be resolved soon hopefully There was workaround where u open WhatsApp web on your PC and share it that way. I just tried it and it didn't work. Guess they're doing some maintenance work, hope the team manages to fix it soon. The in-app miniplayer is a huge deal. SOLUTION! This worked for me: go to settings in Android, applications, look for ""Whatsapp"" and press ""force stop"". Link preview started working immediately on the phone and also on the web version. Same problem here. iOS.

For some reason it only works in 4G. When i switch to wifi it stops working. Have had the same issue for the last week. Tried the forcestop, WhatsApp web and youtube timestamp workaround methods but none worked. Even tried reinstalling the app but nothing seems to have worked for me.

I have contacted WhatsApp's customer support system explaining the problem and received this response:

Hi,

Thanks for your message.

We're aware of the issue and are working on fixing it in a future update of WhatsApp.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us. We'll be happy to help!

So hopefully we'll have a solution soon in an update its still happening Yeah, also having this issue on both my Android phone and on WhatsApp web on my PC... Same issue here, both web whatsapp and mobile whatsapp. They really ought to work on this faster, it has been quite some time now. Just roll back to a previous version or something, it should not be that difficult to at least get this issue fixed. i think its a sabotage from whatsapp to google  


this doesn't have to happen! This is a workaround of sorts -  Whatsapp will show the name of the video, not a thumbnail. So, that's a bit of an improvement.  
Take a URL:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HM79EG0BF4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HM79EG0BF4)   
Change it to [https://www.youtube.com/embed/8HM79EG0BF4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HM79EG0BF4)   
\- removing the ""watch?v="" and replacing it with ""embed/"" its working again for me. I‚Äôve just ran into this issue today! Any fixes? i have this problem since yesterday, is there any way to fix it? It seems to broken in the latest version of whatsapp on google play. Instead I download the beta version from [apk mirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/whatsapp-inc/whatsapp/whatsapp-2-20-206-18-release/) and I don't face the issue anymore Happening with me on iOS still! Cmon YouTube! Happening to me on whataapp since the last few hours. in my experience, i just fixed it

lights went off my router rebooted

and the problem ceased to exist by itself. This problem started for me about a week ago i reinstalled whatsapp and it worked agajn On ios. I updated whatsapp now and rebooted. Fixed it. Been struggling for the past few days with this Facing this today! It's been like this for months haha wth it works sometimes but broken 98% rest of the time... so sad :( and the  problem returned, curses! been happening for some videos for over 5 months now, but now no videos will show previews Still the same... Oh man WhatsApp is a freaking pile of crap :/ Hi it is 06-Dec-2020 and doesn't work on my android or via WhatsappWeb ... What gives? Just force close Whatsapp and send the link on mobile Data. I read it in the comments and it worked! I am on Android <3 Still doesn't work. 

I tried deleting the cache, restarting phone, whatsapp web, mobile data.

Nothing works. [deleted] Definitely not working on Whatsapp desktop... WTF WhatsApp? not cool... having same problem here on ios. both mobile and web. And still nowadays the problem persists! even in beta version Not working on iphone It's working now in my Android. I'm using https://web.whatsapp.com/ and most of the time I face the youtube video's title not popped-up but when I removed ""&feature=emb_title"" .. it works 100% Still not working. Really sucks because it forces me to either type the name of the video under the link myself or see if the video is available on a different platform. https://youtu.be/VmZvjv4co6U As per https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/231860/youtube-link-preview-not-showing-up-in-whatsapp/231861#231861

The best solution I could find was to adapt the URL copied in the share button

https://youtu.be/bDPczGUovzE
to

https://youtube.com/embed/bDPczGUovzE Nah, the link preview works on ALL APPs that I use such as facebook and Telegram, only Whatsap is fucking up

There are reports that people have been using the beta Whatsap version and it works. So it is the incompetent Whatsap engineers that are fucking shit up. I wouldn't really call this a fix, this is a workaround.

To explain for readers that don't feel like viewing the video: Users will have to go to Boxcubegames' website, paste their YouTube links there, copy the resulting link and paste that in Whatsapp to get a preview. It's not just the miniplayer. The thumbnail and description are very useful to preview what the link is about to your friends, instead of link with a random video ID doesn't work, i'm on WhatsApp web and still doesn't work Just tried this now, doesn't work for me :( >go to settings in Android, applications, look for ""Whatsapp"" and press ""force stop""

I'm on the same page. This works, but on wifi it doesn't load. The 4G thing worked for me! Thank you so much! üôèüôè

Update: not working anymore :/ Same here. Its perfectly works on 4G but not on WiFi.
At least it is working on 4G. >raz

It just works if I exclude the params, typing [https://youtube.com](https://youtube.com) or [https://youtu.be](https://youtu.be) Yes this is happening a lot I doubt it, ezebera, because Facebook owns WhatsApp and the YouTube preview image/comment works fine on Facebook when using the same url that doesn't work on WhatsApp. Works for me! Thanks :) Hey, works for me too. Thanks! Thanks that worked yay works for me! iphone 11 It's not working again for me Same, It worked yesterday and It's not working now :( \+1, android Happening since yesterday. Same here. Not working at all Same, started a few days ago and as of Dec 2nd still not working. Not yet. It's still not working for me. It's working for my friends though?? I have the same problem today. Same problem for a few days here. Android. I cleared whatsapp's cached then forced stop and it worked +1 for me. happening now. Same here, i noticed it a couple days ago Same issue here This worked On android. This just worked for me. I installed this version, but still not working I had the issue yesterday and this morning - noticed this thread, restarted WhatsApp for Windows and now it's resolved. Perhaps it updated in the background?! Having the problem since yesterday. i reinstall whatsapp and fixed it. but only working with the short youtube link (youtu.be/link) Hi on android <3, I'm dad. yep not working on iphone 11, ios 14.2 I'm on beta and its def not working for me lol Issue looks more from YouTube end as other web link are working fine Yes, unfortunately the in-app picture in picture player is an inbuilt feature of WhatsApp afaik, so this solution gives you a preview image with video title , and youtu.be video links, that makes them less boring to share It worked for me on the first day. Now it stopped working. Same! they don't need to be so obvious

but yea that's a sign that the problem isn't from YouTube's part
but from WhatsApp who never fixed it same, i just use the split window feature on note 10+ Same any1 got a fix Didn't work for me they have fixed it. Still not working for me. Hi dad. I am Android But the yt previews are showing on other chat messengers like skype, telegram, even Facebook Same here in this week it stopped working 2 days ago for me in India No, you are on Android. Same here in Brazil, but I'm sure it's not working regardless of country Yep, same issue. Not working for me as well in India. Welp Same issue in Portugal"

2. No, if you actually close the app instead of just switching to a different one. Simply switching could make the app bug out and it could keep recording.  
3. It's 100 MB, which is super low. If you want higher file size, Telegram now serves 2 GB per file.  
4. You can edit that in the Settings but they'll still see some data on you, you can't hide everything. Alright thanks!

Yeah my 2nd question was the one i was really curious about since i accidently opened wrong conversation and clicked on microhpone icon to record voice message.So i denied its microphone permission and uninstalled and then installed app again to make sure it wont keep recording(it stops every recording after i uninstall the app and install it again right?)


But again HUGE thank you for being helpful!"

If the local backup is from a period before you cleared the chat, simply reinstall whatsapp and use the local backup, you will likely get all the messages back provided your local backup is recent but before the moment you cleared the chat. So will I keep the messages for the deleted chats up until that point, and keep all the other chats up to date? And if not is there any way I can do that? No, all chats will be reset to the point when backup was made. 
No, I don't think there is a simple way to achieve what you want precisely. What I have suggested is the closest I can think of, you can always get the chats in an email format by asking your friend and simply keep that somewhere safe. Alright, thanks for the help."
Help! restored chat backup - photos gone;2;hvipsw;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hvipsw/help_restored_chat_backup_photos_gone/;5;"I had to change my iPhone recently and beforehand I backed everything up.

Have I lost them all? 

I‚Äôve approached WhatsApp help about this, and they have just said ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt help you‚Äù. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be much online about this specific issue. 

The backup seems to have worked fine otherwise, all my chats are back, the photos are in the right places, just grey - not greyed out, grey squares. 

Any help appreciated!";2020-07-22 02:43:08;"If you mean you restored it from WhatsApp backup, it usually says that media will be restored later. It restores your messages and lets you get started while it downloads and restores your media in the background. If it's a lot, it may take a while to show up. Thanks for this. It‚Äôs been about three weeks, and no progress yet. Which makes me think they‚Äôre not coming back :( I googled it to see if there was any solutions suggested. From what I read, WhatsApp doesn't seem to backup multiple iterations of your data. Which is a horrible idea for this very reason. Since you have used it for 3 weeks, I'm guessing that the backup has been overwritten multiple times. The only thing I could think of to try is to install WhatsApp on another device and restore the backup to it and see if the pics show up. If they do, I would do a backup from it, uninstall it from the first phone and then reinstall and restore it from backup again. I also got the feeling that WhatsApp does not do well with poor internet connection during backup/restore process.
Also, I noticed my WhatsApp backup settings (I don't think I ever changed them) are set to only backup over WiFi and to not backup videos. You may want to double check your settings.
In my Google searching, there seemed to be some issue between iCloud and WhatsApp backup. There were quite a few complaints. Thankyou. It's a shame, I think I've lost 5 years worth of photos. Some of them are on my camera roll but many others werent :( Just a suggestion, but when I had an iPhone, I used Google photos (still use it on Android also). It's free for high quality uploads which for WhatsApp media should mean original quality since WhatsApp already compresses its media. I'm pretty sure it will back up WhatsApp but I think you have to go into settings and choose to backup WhatsApp media. Also since iPhone uses heif, Google ends up backing your photos up at original size. I also Google's backup and sync and my computer where I had photos all the way from the 90's and backed them all up also. Now I can pretty much see all of my photos that I have taken on my phone. I also used Google's photoscan app to archive some of my family's actual photos. I used my phone on a tripod tilted against coffee table and angled to take the pics. Worked really well. This is a lot longer than I intended...."

I had to remind someone something important at 9 am their time, which is 5 am my time, so I'd be asleep. Here's what I did:  


1. Change Whatsapp's data restriction and allow it to use WIFI only.
2. Turn off WIFI on phone.
3. Restart Whatsapp and send the message to the intended person. The message won't send because Whatsapp cannot connect to the network as WIFI is off.
4. Use a WIFI scheduler app (I used WIFI Automatic on android) and set it to turn WIFI on everyday at 5:00.
5. Went to sleep normally. Woke up next day, WIFI was turned on automatically and message was sent at 5 am my time (9 am recipient).
6. How do I know it worked? I sent the same message to my other number at the same time as Step 3, so I can check when the message arrived.  
Aaand voila! A simple solution to schedule a Whatsapp message in case of urgent need/sleep interruption/time difference etc. Hope Whatsapp adds a scheduling feature soon so we dont have to go through all this!";2020-07-21 18:54:55;Wow thanks. You're welcome

Can unknown number still message me after change number;1;huyn7t;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/huyn7t/can_unknown_number_still_message_me_after_change/;3;"Hi guys, i want to ask, 

If someone unknown message me on WhatsApp, and then I block them and change my number with WhatsApp change number feature.

 If I unblock them on my new WhatsApp, and then they message to the old chat room, will it be delivered to my new WhatsApp?";2020-07-21 04:54:07;"Okay, let me see if I understand this correctly. 
You blocked someone. Changed your number. Unblocked the person. 

You and the unknown person are in a same group (by the term 'old chat room' I think you meant an active group) .

Would you receive any messages sent by him/her in the group?

Answer is yes. Even if you block a person or not, if you both are members of a group, you will receive his/her messages. No matter what. But if they cannot send you a direct message, as long as their number is blocked.

Also, if you both are in a common group and you change your number, they can see you've changed your number even if you have blocked him/her.

This information is a few months old. But I don't think WhatsApp have made any changes to this. Hi, thank you for your answer :) 

No, we're not in the same group, what i mean by chat room is just usual chat conversation on whatsApp.

So, if we're not in the same group, that person wouldn't be able to message me after i change my number and unblock him, right?

I ask this because that unknown person keep messaging me, even after i block some number, he would use new number again. I am getting tired having to block him continiously.

Thank you again for your answer :) No. He cannot know. But he can see that you're no longer using the same number. 

And you have an option to notify your contacts that you have changed your number on WhatsApp. If you do not select this option, only the members in the group will be notified.

Edit; I tested this on my android phone's latest WhatsApp version. But didn't choose to notify contacts."

What WhatsApp offers you is... delete account and create new one with another number (means they offer nothing to solve) Indians arrange the marriage of their sons and daughters. Some parents of Indian daughters are more keen on finding a well settled groom for the ladies. And sometimes they look for grooms settled overseas. 

Indian guys who are settled overseas will be frequently requested by their parents for his willingness to start seeking marriage alliances.

The parents might have noted down the number from the incoming calls they received from their sons - which in most cases would be through Skype or other VoIP services - which might have shown a number that you are holding.

Or possibly, the number might have been incorrectly noted down - 1 or 2 digit s swapped by its places.

Or some of these guys, who aren't really interested, might have given a number that is not theirs, or they stopped using, so that, they can escape from their parents' constant follow ups and at the same time not receive any calls too. 

These are just some probable scenarios. I'd report and block the numbers, I always get scam calls which I just ignore. Some phone operators exchange phone number lists for money. Maybe your number was part of the list I am wondering if any of your friends would have made a fake profile in an Indian dating site, using your number, as a joke or something... This is what Im thinking the most. But Im not sure."

Leave some time interval. So that eventually the bot times out after numerous failed attempts. I agree with all the above solutions. But make sure to remove yourself from any common groups before doing anything.

If you don't think anyone would 'rat you out' you can try changing the number and only give it to your trusted contacts. This only helps if you remove yourself from any common groups else he will see that you've changed your number.

Now comes the solution others have been. The bots can only do so much so now you can switch back to your old number.

OR, forget above solutions and be a persistent guy like me.

Remove yourself from common groups. Change the number. Install WhatsApp on another phone (or WhatsApp business app, although I'm not sure if the old number can be used on it since it had an account on the regular app) and use the old number. Delete WhatsApp app or leave it on with WiFi or cellular data. Your friend might think he's won since he's 'forced' you to stop using that number where you've only changed your number. Wouldn't uninstall rather than delete have the same effect with less hassle? If memory serves me right, WhatsApp holds your undelivered messages for 30 days, so they could flood in once he reinstalls. Exactly my point but uninstalling you are reducing you time interval. I think that the bot can still spam you messages if you uninstall. Deleting your account is the only way to time out the bot."

It happens if the simcard you've saved all your contacts is turned off or removed, if you save contacts on google account, check if that is still logged in. https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/seeing-numbers-instead-of-contacts-names In Telegram lol That seems like a bug to me. Shouldn't happen. Try getting the beta/wait for an update. My contacts are synced with google and its logged in. Can you see their name in 'contacts' without dialing their number? try searching their name in contacts. Also check if whatsapp has the permission to access you contacts from settings-manage app/apps-whatsapp-permissions Contacts show up fine. Just like the phone should. If those doesn't work, I can't think of any other possible problems, sorry. Went into permissions and all where disabled expect storage.

This problem occured when I was told to upgrade the app. I upgraded and this issue happend so maybe somthing with the upgrader wiped the permissions? So the problem is now resolved after you've allowed the permissions right? Yeah it must be the problem with your package installer. In some versions, they won't allow certain permissions as default to apps coz of improved security. You'll have to manually allow them from the settings. Keep this in mind, this might occur with various apps in the future. Yes. It recently occured after whatsapp told me that my version was too old and I had to update it to continue to use it.

So I updated thru play store and after the install, it started this problem. But now all is well. Only thing is that I lost my previous chat history in the group im in."
Change number without notifying everyone, but keeping chats and groups;2;hujuds;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hujuds/change_number_without_notifying_everyone_but/;0;"Hey guys,

with Apple phones, is there a way to set up a new number on your actual account, without deleting anything (deleting app data and reinstalling WA for example) and to **not** notify anyone about your new number, or only people you want to know about your change?

I've read there is a ""number change feature"" from WA itself, what let you choose weather to notify everyone, only contacts or custom. But that way, it automatically exchanges your old number with the new one in all groups, either way.

Any solution to keep the chats, but change number without the notification to them or groups? 

Because it's the phone of a friend (I'm using android), please guide any Apple phone settings precisely.

There is a work around for me (choosing to view the image to in gallery then tapping edit then tapping the save button), but this takes time and I prefer the more streamlined approach of being able to manually select an image or bulk images and download the specific ones I want to keep. 

I am aware of the setting that allows downloaded media to automatically save to my gallery, but to be frank I loathe having this feature on as it chews up all my storage space because I get sent a lot of images on a daily basis. 

Does anyone know how to help me or if there's something I'm missing? It would also be great if the Dev's could implement this feature, I'm not sure if there's a specific reason there isn't a dedicated ""download image"" option on WhatsApp for Android.

All you need to do is delete whatsapp off your new phone and also tick the box about deleting the saved data (this is not the saved data your trying to re-install from google drive).

Download whatsapp again, enter your phone number and select yes for the 2 permission options it gives you. It will then download all your data from google drive. Thanks for your reply, but I still see the same message.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/f9vc3k/theres_an_app_called_beta_maniac_that_tells_you/fiubgdw/ If you successfully the joined the beta then go and check on play store if you received the update.

any way to transfer WhatsApp messages from android to apple phone?;1;htlv0h;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/htlv0h/any_way_to_transfer_whatsapp_messages_from/;4;"I've been looking into switching to an Apple phone again and I've got no issues with it except that I'm afraid that there will be no ways of transferring my Whatsapp messages (which I cherish very dearly) between the two devices.   
I've been searching for a solution far and wide on the internet but all that comes up are ads for paid transfer services like dr. fone/ mobiletrans etc. 

However, I've come across some stories where people described that some of their messages HAVE transferred between an android and apple phone (with the exception of group chat history, but individual messages between two contacts being intact).

Does anyone have any experience with this? Is something like that possible without using some other sketchy third party softwares that would be paid? If a third party software is needed for such a thing to be possible, any tips, recommendations and experiences with such?

Edit: recommendations for good free 3rd part software is greatly appreciated :)";2020-07-18 21:51:28;No, you can't. Sorry.

Restore;6;htfl8m;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/htfl8m/restore/;4;"Hi all,

So here is the story: I had my WhatsApp app for sometime on my iPhone. When my phone got hacked I decided to delete some apps and WhatsApp was one of them. Then I reinstalled the app and tried to follow the procedure to restore my old chat logs. I didn‚Äôt find all the conversations. I really need to have them restored. Is there someway to restore the data? 
Note : my phone is Apple iPhone.

Many thanks";2020-07-18 15:10:26;"I‚Äôve had several problems with my iPhone and have done several restores from backups. The only problem I can imagine happening is that your iCloud storage ran out before all your conversations were successfully backed up, hence why you only see some of your  conversations.

You can check this under your iCloud storage settings.

If you did in fact run out of storage, I‚Äôm afraid you are likely to hace lost those conversations forever.

Another thing that could be going on is that if you just restored, conversations may still be downloading. This has sometimes happened to me but I only see a problem with voice messages, photos and videos, the text messages are there but larger files take  longer to download. You cant. This proves your backup wasnt up to date. Probably because your icloud was full and your whatsapp got too large. You just restored an old backup (the one performed the last day it fitted in icloud). For the next time, you couldve saved everything if you havent deleted whatsapp first and when to check the mast date of your backup, hence you wouldve notice its outdated and start liberating icloud space to perform a new updated backup. AND NOW deleting and reinstalling whatsapp wouldve brought all your conversations. When you're restoring, it will bring back data from your last backup. You can't restore any conversation or data after the last backup. This will unfortunately not be possible my phone is apple iphone lmao"

I immediately activate two-factor authentication (pin code) and backup email, but like immediately afterwards someone else is trying to register with the same number, prompting me to verify again (and then i have to wait either 6 hours our 2 days)...

How come once a number is used it still can be reused ? I'll have to wait out to start again...

Shall i still be able to re-register with this number ?";2020-07-17 18:13:33;"Because phone companies can recycle old numbers, they need to give priority to those who have the number even if the account has two factor verification. If you want a permanent account, use a real number. That's not what i meant. I mean once a number registers on Whatsapp, shouldn't Whatsapp just stop other users registering with it ? As I said, they can't do it because a number that has an account might be recycled by the company. Then the person who bought it would be unable to register. ok...

But if i do activate the two-factor authentication, the number, even when reused by someone else for whatsapp, basically makes it unusable for him no ?

As to me, this means that every time someone does reuse it, i need to validate the number again, so going thru the 6hour - 2days waiting time scheme ? It doesn't really make it unusable. I have a friend whose current number belonged to someone who had two factor verification. When the other user fails to validate the number, whatsapp deletes the old account. i see... So basically, each time some new user uses the same number, I'll be prompted to verify and will be able to reuse my whatsapp account until i do so (with the WA delays...) ?"

What's App Refusing to Delete my Old Account (That Still Has My Info);1;hsio5s;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hsio5s/whats_app_refusing_to_delete_my_old_account_that/;2;"1) I am in Malaysia in February 2018 and purchase a sim card there.  I make this sim card numberattached to my What's App Account.  I then use my What's App Account with this number.

2) I leave Malaysia a few days later, and I no longer have this Malaysian sim card.  But I still keep my What's App number the same.  

3) In July 3, 2020, I get a notification from What's App saying that someone is trying to log in to my account.  I decline this notification, but then I am logged off my what's app account.  I try to log back in, but then they ask for a verification code, that will be texted to the number.  Again, I don't have this sim card so I am unable to get this code. 

4) On July 5, 2020.  I am able to retrieve my chat history from a previous iCould backup and I create a new What's App account with a new number, based on the sim card I currently have.  

5) I notice that my friends still see the old account in their chat history, which also has my profile picture and information.  

6) I contact What's App, and from my understanding, I have to wait 7 days because, according to an email from What's App, What's App ""can‚Äôt deactivate your account during the seven-day period after two-step verification is enabled.""

7) On July 14, I contact What's App again, in order to see if this account can be deactivated.  But I am told I need the old sim card for this.  But to go back to point 2 in this list I am writing, I do not have this sim card.  There is no way I can verify. 

Essentially, I just need this account with my information deactivated and deleted.  I don't want to use it anymore.  I want my data attached to this number deleted.  If I need to provide documents proving my identity, I can do that.  But I don't even remember the sim company for this Malaysian card  because I bought this card a long time ago in a small store.  Yet What's App is making this very difficult for me.  

**TLDR: How do I delete an old account I no longer have access to yet still have my profile photo and status update?**";2020-07-17 00:20:43;"It's not your number anymore.
WhatsApp accounts are tied to the phone number NOT a person.
When you stop using a SIM card and it's number for XXX time the phone provider consider it as unused and issues it to somebody else.

Now this person is the legal owner of your old number, and by extension it's his account. He has to change his details and photo. Nothing you can do about, sorry.

You would have had to change the number in settings as soon as you knew that number as definitely lost.

Concerning your friends, it's normal that your old account still shows up. They saved it that way with YOUR name. Even if the other person changes his name it won't override your friends contactbook.

I hope that clarified the situation for you. no one has this account yet, because when i try texting this number, I only see one check mark.  so they can still just reset the account so there is not information tied to it.  I don't want this number again, but I want my info tied to it deleted.  

and what about the groups that this old number was in?  does this new person have access to those groups?  

And I see that after 120 days, a non-active whatsapp account will be reset.  would that then remove my image and status information?  

thanks a lot for the reply.  way better than whatsapp automatic responses."

In the morning after she unblocks me, will I still see her last online time or the one that she blocks me at?

She will have to go into WhatsApp to unblock you so you will get an accurate last seen when she does unblock you. I think there is a bigger problem here though which is you are overly paranoid and possessive. I wouldn't trust the girl you're talking too if she's doing that. Oh and yes you can see their last seen if they have that set to public or contacts only. ‚òπÔ∏è sry.. my last girlfriend (first) of 3 years cheated on me with 4 guys.. and I gave basically all my effort and love for her, I was never ever like this before.. it's sad I know, and unfair to generalize this on any other person I meet.. He is not paranoid nor possessive. You sound like you came from /r/TwoXChromosomes. 

All he asked is whether it will show her last seen. 
If she is intentionally lying to him to pretend she is sleeping when she just continues to chat into the night, then he has the right to know this to not waste time on her. 

OP: if she blocks you at 11PM, and unblocks you at 5AM, then you will see her last online as 5AM. Not when she last blocked you. 
Easiest way would be to just ask someone to see if they see the same info as you do when she disappears. Oh, I understand, it's definitely understandable that she gave you trust issues. However, relationships are based on mutual trust, communication and boundaries. If you're starting off imagining that she's blocking you when she goes to sleep, with absolutely no evidence, that's not a good starting point for a healthy relationship. I don't have anyone I know that knows her, but I woke up earlier than her, then her last online was the same.. so that's good.. üòÅ Yeah but he made that up and his paranoia was proven to be fake... hence paranoid and possessive lmao."

I didn't think about the phone root,that you were talking about...
My first thought went like to get into the root file of the sticker...
LMAO it worked well yeah partially... ( accidentall success)
I made a *.webp animated sticker of my own and just copy pasted it with an existing name in the what'sapp sticker folder... And voila I just bypassed it 
Lol What folder did you paste the .webp into? I tried with Whatsapp/Media/Whatsapp Stickers/ deleting a sticker (I had it saved as favorite to do so) and creating a .webp file with the same name, but it didn't work for me. The sticker I deleted was still on my favorites and there was no track of my ""custom"" sticker. Can you please explain your process more precisely? Thank you in advance. data/data/com.whatsapp ?? Dude, i testing on my iPhone (jailbroken), explain better pls.. you downloaded an animated sticker in .tgs..you renamed it exactly like a .webp sticker that is located in the sticker folder of WA, also changing from .tgs to .webp .. replaced the old sticker with this animated.  right?? and opening WA you have the animated sticker in the same place as the old one ?? Everything you did is fine...... But did you check if the sticker was an animated sticker already?
I renamed and copied with a regular sticker it didn't work at first but when I replaced an existing gif sticker of my own .webp it worked. I dont have single clue about iphones mate. mine's android
PLZ don't think, it's a complete success... I already mentioned it before that it's a partial success means,
And for your question - you have to first convert YOUR VIDEO INTO *.webp format 
Just renaming won't help
And anyway idk about iphones sorry! I‚Äôve tried this, I‚Äôm jailbroken on iOS 13.5. I have the sticker maker beta which makes it available for you to make gifs into .webp stickers. I used the tweak AppData to locate the shared WhatsApp folder where stickers were located, I copied the most recent animated sticker I was able to save inside WhatsApp. And then used Filza to copy and replace the made .webp sticker made from the sticker maker beta app into the sticker folders, I was able to make the sticker show up but I could not use it :(, if you have any luck let me know K, Thanks.. I do some tests and see if I can also do it on ios. i used the beta sticker maker and instead of the image i putted a gif..i had to put at least 3 image to share the pack on filza..i have searched on filza the generic sticker folder till i reached the alphanumeric one where i do have all my stickers..i copied one alphanumeric code from one of them and renamed the gif/sticker like that. Then i replaced the old sticker with this new gif/sticker in the same folder. now i have the same name but the gif instead of the old sticker. I only don't know how to cut the background from it. I can with the normale stickers but not gif.  but in the end everything works . I did the same thing, I wonder if I messed up somewhere cause it does not work. Also, if you have photoshop or after effects, on a computer make a masking and export as png with transparency enabled, and then use a png sequence to .webp online converter and then import and replace with the made webp files from the sticker creator"

I went into notification and turned them on and now I'm getting a complete pull-down notification.

Turning the phone off and then back on again
Closing WhatsApp and clearing the cache
Reset my internet settings
Removing WhatsApp from apps that are resting
It was an app that was resting when I got the on top notification only

Not just whatsapp, you shouldn't ever share any otp. No app will send otp on their own unless someone requests it to change password. I'm not sure how they got through the 2 step verification though. But there's no way they could've hacked your sim, if they could do that, they wouldn't have to scam the otp out of you in the first place. > **What's the likelihood they hacked my SIM card? It's possible - 'cus they got through the two-factor auth..** 

The sim-card itself is safe. As far as I know there is no malware out there that targets sim-cards, so the chance that someone installed anything on there is practically zero. And if they had the kind of access to your phone they would need to mess with the sim card, they would surely get into any other apps you have, like social media, email etc. Unless you suspect that any of those got hacked at the same time, you have nothing to worry about as long as you don't do the same thing again. You‚Äôre right, thanks so much. Just so dodgy that they got in despite Whatsapp 2FA"

Any recent success moving from Android to iOS?;5;hrghoq;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hrghoq/any_recent_success_moving_from_android_to_ios/;8;"I know there isn't a native way since on Android the backups go to Google Drive and on iOS it goes to iCloud but there must be a way. I've tried Dr. Done and backuptrans with zero success. 

Has anyone had recent luck moving over?";2020-07-15 06:47:48;Yup. I transferred my entire chat history to an iPhone about 6 GB worth of it today. It was ridiculously tedious cause I also had to update my phone number after which google drive wouldn‚Äôt let me restore the backup onto an android (cause my actual Android died on me) and to transfer it to the iPhone I needed it working on an Android device first. I used backuptrans and it worked flawlessly. I suggest you use a paid version. I used a few cracked versions and none of them worked - they were instead the source of most of my frustration. Did you have to install an older version of iTunes to get it to work? Nope Weird. Will need to give it another try, I keep getting prompted to install iTunes via a link they are providing. Can you link me to which backuptrans you used? My bad, I did end up installing the iTunes from that link along the way. I tried so many different things that it slipped my mind when you asked me that initially. I started off with a cracked version and iTunes I already had installed but kept getting an error, so I checked for updates and upgraded backuptrans to version 3.2.134 (the latest I think) and luckily it retained the local backup copy I had created with the prior version. I paid for the personal version and what I had been struggling with previously - the transfer to iTunes completed without a hitch. Hope that helps. Appreciate it! By any chance, did you transfer SMS/MMS messages using backuptrans as well? No I haven‚Äôt tried that yet. Might give it a go over the weekend. Cool thanks

Lost new messages after the outage.

I noticed that all my conversation data had been erased, aside from a few new messages (I guess sent in the period before I reinstalled WhatsApp). I took a quick glance at some of the new messages but then decided that since I'm missing my contacts, I would just reinstall WhatsApp again and upload my most recent backup.

Unfortunately, this last reinstall provided the old chat history but the new messages that occurred before I reinstalled the first time were nowhere to be seen. And I'm not quite sure how to get those messages back.

Any ideas?";2020-07-15 05:55:16;

Can't scan QR code from WhatsApp web. Please help!;3;hr9lua;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hr9lua/cant_scan_qr_code_from_whatsapp_web_please_help/;22;"I've been using WhatsApp on my phone and PC successfully for years. Today WhatsApp web lost the connection to my phone. I tried to scan the QR code and my phone just keeps saying ""Use the WhatsApp Web scanner to scan this QR code.""  I've done this several times before, so I'm sure the QR code was framed correctly. I tried clearing the cache and cookies and also tried using a different browser. No joy.

Any and all suggestions most appreciated!";2020-07-14 23:45:17;"Same thing happened to me just now. The QR scan message would just repeatedly pop up and my phone would vibrate each time it attempted to scan the code.

Here's what I did:

1) On the phone I signed out the PC device (logged out). Then when I tried to re-scan the code on the phone it said ""go to [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com)"" to scan the QR code.

2) Then went to [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com) in Chrome and scanned the QR code there.

All fixed, got re-signed in on the PC app.

Hope this helps I don't have anything helpful to add other than saying ""it's happening to me too"".  Same story, just started today.  I'm assuming it's a problem on their end. I was having trouble with this too until I realized that I clicked on the wrong thing. If you go to the options at the top right corner of the app you'll see ""WhatsApp Web"" right under ""New Group"" and ""New Broadcast"". By clicking on ""WhatsApp Web"" you'll be able to scan the QR code. Don't click on ""settings."" Doing that will only allow you to scan QR codes to add people to your contact list like when you can't find someone using their profile name. That's why it keeps giving you the error message ""Use the Whatsapp scanner to scan this QR code."" Good lord. I just wasted over an hour trying to fix this. Was unable to log in to Whatsapp on a new Windows 10 laptop. Had no issues reading the QR code for google messages.

My solution has not yet been reported in this thread!

What worked for me: disable 'hardware acceleration' in the Chrome browser. The QR code looked different to the naked eye after doing this and refreshing. Scanned immediately. I've set it to ""remember this device"" and have re-enabled hardware acceleration without issue. To clarify, on the PC I went to [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com) in my browser to scan the QR code there with my phone, because scanning it from the app itself didn't work. Success! I'm not sure exactly what I did that was different, but it worked! Thank you *very* much! All other replies are kinda not clear. All other posters are going to the wrong place by following what the steps on  [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com/) are telling them.

All you need to do is go to the 3 dots and then instead of going to settings click on ""Whatsapp Web"". The QR icon next to your name in settings is the wrong place to be. I've gone round and round in circles on the interweb trying to find a solution and here it is - thanks for taking the time to post the solution. You're a legend. ""Don't click on 'settings'"" was the point: you have to use **'WhatsApp Web' menu option from chat list menu**, not QR code from Settings. Thumbs up! wow.. thanks for that!  this is exactly the problem I've been having!! oh.... thank you. you really pointed out the really issue.... ha ha.... i did as you said, word by word and yes!!! now is working, thank and hare krishna greetings from bosnia This is the only correct solution. The rest are just telling BS THANK YOU IT WORKED! Thanks bro, works now !!! THIS WORKED FOR ME!!!!! Thank you so much, I have searched since days for a solution - made my day :) It worked! Thanks bro! This worked for me too, hooray!   From settings (in the app) -> WhatsApp Web - sign out all devices.  Then go back to [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com) on the PC, and the QR code worked. Thanks! Thank you for putting that more succinctly than I did haha This is the right answer and needs to be higher. Thanks. Thank you. Correct answer. the correct answer is here. Thank you! no worries, edited ""garbage"" to ""kinda wrong"" bc the replies themselves are not garbage at all."

Edit: wow just realized they released them just recently, awesome! WEBP. But you can't create custom ones as of now. They were added 4 days ago You can't create custom animated stickers as of now. I just got one of a (real, not cartoon) dog shaking his lil' butt like he was dancing. So I'm inclined to think that custom animated stickers are a thing already Some people have done it on Android with modded versions of WhatsApp, but those apps break the TOS and are bannable."

The other option i saw consists in manually uninstalling the app and then reinstall it, but i'm afraid to loose the data in the process.

Maybe there is a way to access the app or to access the data from my PC without opening the App, if anyone has any idea i would very much appreciate it.

I mean, none of the people using the modded version are using it for 'security' or 'privacy'. Sometimes we have to make a choice between security and a basic privacy feature like: Hiding online status.

Apart from that: I trust a mod that's coming from a trust worthy individual. Not all mods are bad IMO.

Plus features like ability to view deleted status/stories, deleted messages, deleting messages of others even after hours of sending it, bombing people's inbox, secretly viewing everyone's status, downloading them in a click, scheduled messages, automated response bot, being able to select 100s of photos at once, sending photos and videos in original quality, uploading status in original quality, completely different UI themes, custom privacy for each contacts, fingerprint lock for individual chats, hidden chats, etc etc. are something that won't let you go back once it spoils you. Telegram, not for being annoying, but it‚Äôs the solution for many Aren't most messengee apps actually closed source except Signal? The issue is... people don‚Äôt worry about privacy and security :( Telegram is a fallen soldier. Shits so OP and badass. I wonder if whatsapp will ever add any features that telegram has"

Whatsapp web recent stickers missing on Android.;2;hpyq8k;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hpyq8k/whatsapp_web_recent_stickers_missing_on_android/;1;"Hi,

Is there any way to use recent stickers on Whatsapp web? It seems that there is no option to use them. I'm using Whatsapp web on the latest chrome and I have the latest Whatsapp update as well. I can however use stickers packs but not recent stickers nor favorite stickers.Also one of my friends is using an apple phone, and he can use his recent stickers on Whatsapp web. We both have the same chrome versions as well.

&#x200B;

I tried clearing cache on chrome, re-logging and nothing worked. I also tried contacting whatsapp customer support it didn't also help. If any of you guys know anything please I would like to hear it. Also tried using Whatsapp desktop application for windows, didn't help either.

&#x200B;

Maybe it doesn't support Android version but I don't know for sure because I couldn't find any sources about that.

&#x200B;

[This is from my friend, Clearly he can access his recent stickers on his Whatsapp web.](https://preview.redd.it/oo0qweh0tga51.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa0587c95467676af82d3a394b468a4f41686d4c)

Also a weird thing happened just after he sent me this image. On his end ""GIF icon"" shown on the above image disappeared just after he sent me that image. LOL. I don't know why.

Thanks!(Sorry for bad English)";2020-07-12 20:57:42;Same as you bro. I think it doesn't support Android version.... And plus, my stickers loads so slowly that I never use it because of that. WhatsApp needs to improve it for sure at least for Android users.

Custom Animated Stickers?;14;hpt1r8;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hpt1r8/custom_animated_stickers/;10;My friend sent some custom animated stickers and I was wondering how to make some;2020-07-12 14:37:21;"X2 Want to know how to make custom ANIMATED stickers. It's a new feature rolled out last week. I think only approved stickers are allowed for now (in the WhatsApp sticker market). Custom animated stickers appear to be available only through modded 3rd party WhatsApp clients, according to some developers of sticker making apps. I think something will be done soon to allow custom animated stickers on original WhatsApp. There are dozens of apps that help make free stickers, just search ""WhatsApp sticker maker"" I see, also, happy cake day! **he asked** how to make ANIMATED STICKERS, Currently there is only **one app** in google play that can add them to **modded** whatsapp

nobody is sharing how to make animated .webp format or how to succesfuly add them to whatsapp yet, thats his question Webp animation can be easily created from video or gif with ffmpeg

    ffmpeg -i input.gif -loop 0 output.webp

No idea how to get it into WhatsApp though. Tbh I don't get this at all, why can't they just make it possible to share the right file instead of forcing you to use shitty third party apps. which app (I know Viko has the feature enabled on beta Chanel, don't know if that's the one you are referring to) i had success to make and add my own animated stickers with 2 programs

1- i used [https://ezgif.com/webp-maker](https://ezgif.com/webp-maker) to convert my animated GIF or Apng images to webp format

2- i used [Animated Sticker Maker for WA WAStickerApps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nut.id.sticker&hl=en)

and added them into my modded  whatsapp Plus Apk (i think GB whatsapp works too)

now the problems i faced was:

\- Transparent Webp animated stickers refuse to be added to whatsapp

\- none Transparent GIF with a background converted to webp can be added.

&#x200B;

i have tried several things from lowering the frames to colors to make my transparent animated stickers work and failed

&#x200B;

all the stickers i see in Wa sticker maker have a background

&#x200B;

i did see some people manage to make them with transparent backgrounds but nobody is saying what they used and how they added it into whatsapp

&#x200B;

the current Google play app doesn't do it the way i want (with Transparency)

&#x200B;

i am really Puzzled why do they not share how to make our own and add them into their stupid app, why is it so complicated to add an animated sticker, currently there is no  animated Webp app that let you add animated stickers with transparency (like the official animated stickers they provide inside their app)

all the tools available to public are shit

why is it so hard to create and manage stickers from a PC, they force you to use Android apps to do it [Animated Sticker Maker for WA WAStickerApps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nut.id.sticker&hl=en)"

But the think is that even if he saved my number, I didn't even provide him my contact number;2020-07-12 11:44:26;"By status you mean the about status or the status updates(30 sec video, image or text)? If you can see his status updates, then surely he has saved your number. You need to save his as well inorder to see each other's status. Referring to the 'about status' Ohh then the chances are;  
1. He got your number somehow and saved it.  
2.He blocked the other number.  
  
Try doing these:  
1. check from a third number to see if the second number was blocked.  
2. Save his number in your phone and wait. If he did save your number then you will be able to see his status updates. Turn OFF 'read reciepts' from your settings now itself so that he won't know if you saw his status.
3. Save his number and post a status update, check if he saw it or not. This is risky coz if he did save your number, he would know that you saved his as well as he could see your status update. Read reciepts should be turned ON while doing this or else you wouldn't be able to check who saw it."

Great! We would happily publish them for free on iOS and without ads on https://anysticker.app Damn, nice stickers too, I was recently wondering how to make a pack myself, care to give some pointers? Yes on iPhone they seem to be able to create 'stickers' based on caricatures of themselves (from a panel of options) to reflect various moods. I cannot find the same feture in Android. Thank you!

Ooh, that sounds either like an app that allows you to do that or a feature for iPhones, I am afraid I don't know how they make them :( Thanks! I think it must be a feature of iPhone.

Restoring media stuck at 100%;6;hph1f7;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hph1f7/restoring_media_stuck_at_100/;6;"**[SOLVED, LOOK AT BELOW FOR ANSWER]**

Hi,

Recently I was using my old HTC m8, however, the battery died, won't charge anymore. So I made a back-up to google drive with the last battery and put my SIM card as a secondary SIM to Xiaomi Mi 5s. Then I made Whatsapp dual app and signed into google account associated with M8's Whatsapp. I restored the messages, however, it stuck at 99% or 100%. I tried the following:

&#x200B;

* Clear the cache of 2nd Whatsapp, the problem persists
* Uninstall the 2nd Whatsapp, install it again, the problem persists.
* Clear the cache, Uninstall it, reboot, install it, the problem persists.
* I turn off the Wifi, cleared cache, reboot the phone, manually deleted all Whatsapp files (with file manager), and opened Whatsapp. The problem persists.
* Find the local storage files inside Whatsapp folders. Copied them to another folder. Deleted both Whatsapps. Install only a single copy (without the dual app). Manually copied databases, backups, media to WhatsApp folder. Login to the WhatsApp. Now, it tried to restore, but again, it stuck. The only difference is it did not download 1gb of data, it only tried to download 2.5mb of data, but it stuck at 0%.
* Clear the cache, uninstall it, reboot. Make display turn off mode never, put the phone into the charger. Installed Whatsapp, make it persistent by locking it (In Xiaomi you can lock the app so that when it is moved to the background tasks, it won't be killed). Left it overnight for restoring messages. I did this step 2 times, the problem persists.
* Remove the original Whatsapp as well as the dual one. Install only a single copy of Whatsapp (without the dual app) and login to the account, the problem persists.
* Tried mobileTrans app  [https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/whatsapp/whatsapp-backup-stuck.html](https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/whatsapp/whatsapp-backup-stuck.html). When I followed the steps, it worked, BUT, I cannot back up to Google drive anymore. When I checked the Playstore (I am 100% that it is the account connected to M8 Whatsapp), I can still install Whatsapp from there. So I assume that the MobileTrans app installed his own version of Whatsapp and restored my chat from there. Because I suspect it installed its own version of Whatsapp, I am uncomfortable with it. And since I cannot back up to Google, I uninstalled it. You might ask this: How could you not back up to Google? Well, when I try to click the backup button, it saves the data locally. There is no pop-up or no section for connecting to Google account. So I am 99% sure that the MobileTrans app uses a modified version of Whatsapp.

&#x200B;

You might ask, why is it such a big deal? Well, if something goes wrong, I would like to back up my data. Currently, as the restoring process is not finishing, I cannot back-up my data to Google.

I haven't tried becoming a Whatsapp beta tester. I guess that is my only remaining solution. You might once again, say ""Then, do it"". Well, it is not going to happen today. Since I have uninstalled and installed Whatsapp many many times, Whatsapp is not giving me a code when I try to enter my phone number. It keeps me waiting for hours. In the last step, I had to wait for 2 hours before installing it. So, I am not sure how long will it keep me waiting the next time. This was the last time:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jcqg3vvjeaa51.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eae447999d3c88f5324070bb0fa83ea3bd3ab56

The other problem is, every time I uninstall and restore it, it restores the 7th July version. So I keep losing the last 4 days' messages. I have waited 2 days to see that maybe it will finish after some time. Nope, it is not happening. It is stuck at 99%. If I reset many times, sometimes it is stuck at 100% but still, I have waited at least 2 days for it to be completed 


EDIT: I have found a solution. I am assuming that you are also in my situation and tried to restore your back-up and it somehow stuck at 99-100%. It means that Google already downloaded text messages and most of the documents, images, etc.

- Unlink your Whatsapp account from Google: https://www.wazzapmigrator.com/faq/disable-whatsapp-backups-google-drive
- Uninstall Whatsapp.
- Open file manager. Go to Whatsapp/databases folder. There should be multiple backup files for text messages. For me, I picked a version that is 3 days before the current date. Rename it to `msgstore.db.crypt12`. Do not change the number after cryp12. It can be crpyt9, crypt8, whatever. Just change the name before `.db`. AFAIK, this file contains text messages and possible links to the images, documents.
- Install Whatsapp, provide your number.
- Now, it will try to locate Google backup. Since I have unlinked them, it fails. It will try to find the local backup, and it will succeed.
- It will do a backup from that. Since everything is local, it will take only a couple of seconds.
- Once it is finished, we can link Whatsapp to Google drive and start the back up process.

I am aware that I probably lost some data because the downloading process was stuck at 99-100%. I assume that it is some images or some documents. However, right now, I can at least use my Google drive daily to back up.";2020-07-11 23:25:34;"you, sir, are a lifesaver.

If your account is temporarily suspended I think you can see a timer with a countdown in your app. If it's banned permanently you're gonna get the same response everyone gets. I was banned around 45 days ago and my account was deleted on day 30 but is still banned. I‚Äôve read there is a timer but I haven‚Äôt been able to find it, after the log in with my number, the disclaimer only offers cancel or contact support options.


I wonder if that happens to common suspensions (or on what cases it appears/doesn‚Äôt show up) and yet, I‚Äôve recovered my account before, last year actually, like one month after the fact, but as you suggest someone wrote that I shouldn‚Äôt appeal to the trashy customer service, and let the account come back on its own If there's no timer then you were permanently banned. The timer appears mostly when you're using a third party WhatsApp app.
So yeah, let's hope for the best and wait 60 days :/ Last time I got my account back there was no timer, was kind of a surprise to see I had it back, but since I don‚Äôt use third parties nor jailbreaks (because to me bypassing apps is a headache lately) what is left to my thoughts is to concur with yours, and hope for the best for the next weeks"

I had whatsapp installed on a phone with project fi so I'm able to receive sms on multiple devices. I lost the phone with google fi service. Back ups were uploaded to a google drive account. I  was able to restore the whatsapp account to an iphone with a different number using google hang outs app on my desktop computer (the google hangouts app is associated with my google fi number). The problem I have is that I would like to restore my chat history but the iphone whatsapp app only uploads/downloads to an icloud server (from what I can tell searching the settings options). Is there a way to restore my whatsapp chat history stored on the aforementioned google drive account on an iphone? I hope that wasn't too complicated, thanks.;2020-07-10 23:30:10;

How to restore with the before last Whatsapp backup ?;4;hobhns;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hobhns/how_to_restore_with_the_before_last_whatsapp/;0;"Hi there, 

I had Whatsapp on a Samsung s9 on 2017 and 2018. Then a s9 on 2019. Then a s10 on 2020 that just get stolen. I am quite sure they all backup automatically on Google Drive and on the phone.

So I took back the s9, but it was bugged, so I reinstall Whatsapp. then I perhaps (not sure) ignore the initial restauration proposed so I guess I get the Whatsapp locally restaured on the s9 so until end of 2019... But nothing in 2020 (except just the acception into group I joined in 2020). I uninstall, reinstall but it proposed me only a backup just done on the s9 (after that the s10 was stolen). I am afraid it arised the actually more recent one on the done on the s10.

I just bought a s20, and the only backup during reinstall that it propose to me is the ""after steal"" backup of the s9. So the result is historical conversation from 2017 BUT no one from 2020. 

My request would be how to restore from one of the many backups done juste before the steal and not from the very last incomplete backup done by the s9 after the steal ?

I hope it is clear enough.

Whatsapp backup problem;3;hnluhi;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hnluhi/whatsapp_backup_problem/;3;So about 3 months ago I transferred from iPhone to Android. So I wanted to transfer my Whatsapp data to my new phone, but I got in some trouble. The backup I made didn't transfer to my android phone and I don't know why. I tried lots of things but it didn't seem to work. I also tried to use dr.fone to switch my data, but that didn't really work too so I just made a backup with dr.fone and uploaded it to my pc. My old phone is reset now so the only thing I can work with is the backup I made. I tried merging the backups before but I ran in some trouble. dr.fone made an iPhone backup instead of a whatsapp backup (probably my fault but dr.fone isn't translated so I couldn't really see what I was clicking). Is there any way to restore my whatsapp files from this backup? I now have a backup with a manifest.db file in it. I can read it using DB browser for SQLite, and if I can restore the files, can I merge them with my current data, because 3 months have gone by and I sent a lot of messages.;2020-07-08 20:56:01;you can't transfer from iphone to android Try Backuptrans iPhone WhatsApp to Android Transfer.

Contacts not in contact list can still see my profile picture;2;hnic9a;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hnic9a/contacts_not_in_contact_list_can_still_see_my/;0;"Recently I moved from an iPhone to an Android device (same SIM card) because my old iPhone suddenly broke down. On my iPhone I had several WhatsApp contacts which I talked to.

&nbsp;

I couldn't transfer any of my contacts, meaning that contact list on my Android device is completely empty. I didn't want to transfer any contacts anyway, so that's fine.

&nbsp;

Now one of my former contacts told me he can still see my picture and status. My expected behavior would be that he can't see these details since he's not in my contact list anymore.

&nbsp;

All my privacy settings are set to ""My contacts"". Does anyone know what causes that my old contacts can still see my profile even though my list is empty?

&nbsp;

I can't remember exactly who's on my old contact list, so blocking wouldn't be an option. Would placing my SIM card in my old phone and then somehow removing these contacts solve this problem?

I'm not following correctly. Take images for example, did you paste the images in ""whatsapp/media/whatsapp images"" folder or just the whatsapp folder? I pasted them in the whatsapp folder which was automatically created in the gallery. I just checked and by doing that they are presented in the whatsapp/media/whatsapp images as well"

Also... if I have WhatsApp web open it will go offline if my mouse is not on then main window for a while but will come back online  if I move my mouse back over. I usually use it like that when I‚Äôm working so will ignore unimportant messages. So

Old Whatsapp Pictures on new device get deleted when backing up;1;hmptac;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hmptac/old_whatsapp_pictures_on_new_device_get_deleted/;0;"On my old phone I moved most of my WhatsApp pictures to my SD-Card becuase I was short on storage. Therefore the pictures showed up blurry in the chat and when I tapped them it said something like ""media unavailable"".

I'm just trying yo figure out if someone is ignoring me. They changed their profile picture I was wondering if it can automatically change because it's linked to another website/app like Facebook or if it has to be done manually (which would mean in the second case that the person is ignoring me).

how do delay sending a message?;6;hkwhzt;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hkwhzt/how_do_delay_sending_a_message/;3;"(probably it's a frequent question but I didn't find it- so link to the right place will be great)

&#x200B;

Many times I want to prepare a message but send it, let's say in an hour time.

It could be because I want to have a time gap between the received message I got and my answer, it could be because I hope the sender will send more data soon and there are more options.

The questions is, of course, how do I do it?

&#x200B;

The only way I was thinking of is sending the message to myself (have created me only group) and once in few hours I'm looking into it. 

But it's not a perfect solution since may time I hit the ""reply"" and not the ""new message"" (yes, I'm human :-)   )

&#x200B;

So, is there a third party who is doing it?

Other solution? ideas?

thanks";2020-07-04 06:22:01;Kind of but they're super sketchy, I've been wishing for this kind of feature since forever No official method but some of the fork apps (like GBWhatsApp, WhatsApp Plus) might have it. No guarantee that they're secure, though, so using them is a risk. Like many features in other messengers, delayed send is not supported by WhatsApp.

Third party texts after Whatsapp call?;7;hklth5;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hklth5/third_party_texts_after_whatsapp_call/;3;"Hi everyone,

I'm at a bit of a roadblock and was looking for advice. I often use Whatsapp to talk to my family (they live in a different country). Almost every time we speak there are random intermittent noises on the line. What's more concerning is that my family has received Whatsapp messages and text messages from strange numbers related to parts of our conversations. I've never received these messages.   


Is there a possibility either of our phones are hacked? Is there any way to find out? I've tried looking it up and can't find much information besides scanning for weird apps. I've also factory reset my phone, my family bought a new phone and number and the problem still persists. I use a Samsung with Android and they use a local brand..not sure of the operation system.

I'm worried for their safety at this point. Does anyone have any idea what's going on?

Thanks for your help.";2020-07-03 19:11:34;This is quiet scary, make sure you contact whatsapp support ASAP. That's a good idea. I will give them a call asap. Thank you. Yeah because this is clearly a security breach and could be dangerous.

The best is having voice heads, like you have on Messanger. 
They always forget for some reason the calling feature on Desktop, like Viber has. To be honest WhatsApp always has had one of the cleanest looking UI since the beginning. Just my POV I don't know if you're talking about ios version or android !
But I was talking about android version of Whatsapp which is still following Google's material design 1.0 and this is the only reason why it looks so outdated."

Did you try deleting the data and turning on/off the drive/whatsapp in the settings. Honestly, I'm not impressed by iPhone/iCloud think I'm going back to Android...

Other thing I just thought ...try deleting the data file on iCloud, turn off all the icloud/drive/whatsapp backup settings. Turn it back on and try creating a new backup on whatsapp.

Tbh this process seems so much easier when backing up to Google."

Later, when voice calling did roll out, I believe it was still possible to opt to make a cellular call to a contact who wasn't capable of receiving a voice call over WhatsApp. I'm not sure if it still is.

Combine these, with people who don't actually think about what they're doing or read any prompts before forging ahead, and its easy to see how a rumor like this can start."

Googled this phenomenon quite a bit, saw some people with the same question as mine (even in this sub), but no answer so far. Would be cool to know, it's not a big deal in itself.";2020-07-02 15:36:49;No idea but what I think is, you‚Äôll have GIPHY by default soon because it‚Äôs now an owned-Facebook company, and they obviously want ppl use their services Shit. Tenor seems to yield better results for me, so I hope I get to keep it :) Thanks for the info! Giphy was used by Telegram until Facebook got it, now it uses Tenor, so if you want Tenor.... haha
Can I have two WhatsApp backups on my Google Drive?;1;hjveul;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hjveul/can_i_have_two_whatsapp_backups_on_my_google_drive/;0;"I have two Samsung phones.

I ask because obviously when you look at the backup in Google Drive the backup is labeled by the phone number. I do not want to lose either backup.

Right now I am worried to start up my second phone on WhatsApp because I do not want it to overwrite the data of the first phone.";2020-07-02 14:36:50;

No there's no Import from file function. Plus those are only temporary files that need to be decrypted No there is no encryption what so ever and i have copied them to some other folder and then compressed them to make sure they are safe, if only i knew how isticker app got them imported to whatsapp. I'll try to make an app with these stickers using the whatsapp stickers repo from github but i haven't tried to make an app before and i'm not sure how to do it.

Is this possible considering WhatsApp profiles are tied to phone numbers/SIM cards?;2020-07-01 19:51:47;"The most used software and owned by a giant as Facebook, can‚Äôt be used simultaneously in two devices, terrible, right? 
However Facebook will bring a solution for this and you‚Äôll be able to (they don‚Äôt do it for satisfying its billions of users, they do because its competitor (Telegram) is bringing everyday more features and much more people join daily). It‚Äôs the only way Facebook start working hard on new features for WhatsApp You can try to remote connect to your other device using TeamViewer, though it might not be practical.

Stay away from third-party WhatsApp, they steal your data(esp contacts) and can get you banned. I've seen apps that claim to allow this functionality (WhatsAppPro, Mirror APK apps etc.) Guess they're scams. 

Telegram is great, the only reason I use WhatsApp instead is because everyone else does. Hopefully this changes soon, I've had enough of Facebook's shit üòÇ Yeah connecting remotely isn't practical. I had no idea that 3rd party WhatsApp apps were against WhatsApp's terms of use though. Thanks for the heads up Yes you can find software that offers functionality. But think twice, if no one trust on Facebook services, what can we expect from an unofficial Facebook (WhatsApp) service?
There are many people that love WhatsApp Plus bc they can see the content of deleted messages (and so on). Have u ever thought how bad is it that deleted messages are not really deleted? 
I‚Äôm fortunately getting rid of Facebook services too, WhatsApp is the most complicated but most of my friends already on Telegram üòÉ
Do an extra effort to convince people, search features to teach others and so on :) That's true, privacy is dead with regards to Facebook. I actually have an app that lets you see deleted Whatsapp messages, but it does that by saving records of all your push notifications. 

If WhatsApp Plus lets you use 2 phones for 1 account then I'll definitely use it, even if it comes at the cost of my privacy"

What could you possibly be banned for? It takes time from server side to delete your account, you can't help it but wait. Plus, you only get banned if you get reported enough times. So your dp pissed many people who eventually reported it and you got banned. I think, and I might be wrong here, but he's saying he put up a stupid display pic, not a dick pic. Child porn or massive spam and sometimes they temporarily ban people with modded whatsapp how funny it'll be if it's a d pic I only just noticed the 'report' option. Never seen it before.

Problems with Whatsapp after using Dr Fone (iphone to android) / Dr Fone installs another version of whatsapp??;2;hizevi;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hizevi/problems_with_whatsapp_after_using_dr_fone_iphone/;3;"Hi everyone. 
All day today I've been having weird connectivity problems with Whatsapp on my new Pixel. Intermittently, it just disconnects entirely for a good hour or more, not letting me send or receive new messages. Then it randomly reconnects and works fine for another hour or so - and so on. 

This has only started happening after I ran the Dr Fone app to transfer Whatsapp's content from my iphone to the Pixel, and I feel like it MUST have something to do with this.

When I ran Dr Fone's transfer app, **it basically removed the version of Whatsapp that I had manually installed beforehand, and installed another version**. 

I didn't think too much of it at the time (it was a step-by-step process driven by the desktop app, and the reviews seemed legit so I didn't question it), but after banging my head all day trying to figure out what's going on I figured it must be something to do with Dr Fone.... I checked out Whatsapp in the Google Play store and it just showed as ""DOWNLOAD"", instead of ""UPDATE"" or ""VIEW APP"" or whatever. 

So I downloaded it and now have 2 Whatsapps on my phone. The latest version I just downloaded isn't set up or connected to my account, as if it's a whole different app that isn't even accessing the same info as Dr Fone's one.

I'm not an expert, but doesn't this mean that Dr Fone is installing their own version of the app? I see a lot of people on here have been using and recommending this software, so I'm not 100%. Just not sure what else could be causing the connection probs and this seems like a glaring reason

Anyone know what might be going on??";2020-07-01 03:03:19;"Oh, yeah ..... you've been ummm....... yeah, lets say your now sharing your phone Seems pretty obvious right? Why is everyone speaking so highly about Dr fone??

Edit: what can I do to undo / delete / revoke access, apart from simply deleting the app?? Any tips? This has been such an ordeal and a huge waste of time. I just want to be able to access my WhatsApp history. Should be such a simple task but users are forced to venture into search engines and sifting through shitty scammy software to perform a task that should be built-in. Basically, there is no feature to move between OS's for WhatsApp. Any app that can, would very easily be a good selling app, in all the legitimate apps stores.

I do hear rumors that What'sApp/Facebook is testing having multiple devices on the same what's app account. This should 100% solve the migration problem once and for all"

When taking a picture to be sent inside a conversation in the WhatsApp app on iOS, the app automatically save that photo to the Photos app on my iPhone but without the location where the photo was taken.

Of course its also possible that someone had a client that actually was capable of ending the group. I'm really not sure. If the admin kicks you out, it'll show ""{Admin's number or contact name} removed you""

The whatsapp account phone # that I was using on that phone, was that of a temporary SIM card that I was using.  So I no longer had access to the actual phone #.  After 90 days, I noticed that the display picture disappeared, and it said ""(insert random name here) has left the group chat"".  From that point, it's impossible to retrieve the old account.

Screen 2 - iOS Backup Screen (Stored on iCloud)

I am not able to understand why there are 2 instances of WhatsApp being backed up to iCloud. One is 1.3GB and the other is around 5GB. 

Which one is crucial to retain chats while resetting the device/transferring to a new device?  
Can I turn off either one of the backups or are they both important?

I'd like to know the difference between the two.

https://preview.redd.it/t24xk8xamu751.png?width=2484&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e0c80b32d3618b69090383b71c7412f7460d75a";2020-06-29 16:12:46;"The second image is the full size of WhatsApp on your device locally, not in the cloud. The first image is how much storage WhatsApp data is using in the cloud.

I‚Äôm assuming that data is compressed when it gets uploaded to iCloud, so that could explain a difference in filesizes.

Why not just leave them both on? You have plenty of storage. Screen 1 shows the data the WhatsApp app backs up to iCloud, including only your WhatsApp chats and media.

Screen 2 shows the data iOS backs up to iCloud from your internal storage, including the WhatsApp app and all its configuration and data. So, I‚Äôve noticed that turning off the second one reduces the space used by my iPhone backup on the cloud. 
Also, doesn‚Äôt WhatsApp directly backup data to the cloud? 
The second screenshot shows the WhatsApp data as a part of the iOS backup.
I have extra space because I‚Äôve disabled the second option for 3/6 family members. My cloud keeps filling up because of that.
But if it‚Äôs crucial to keep both turned on, I guess I‚Äôll have to upgrade my iCloud. So, is it necessary to keep both on? Or can I switch off either one? It depends on how you eventually intend on restoring the backup.

If you install a clean copy of WhatsApp on a new device, for instance, you will have to back up your chats through the WhatsApp app. 

But if you intend on completely restoring from your iCloud backup when you set up your new device, you'd back it up to iCloud. 

I'd keep both on just to be safe. Thanks !!! I feel both are important so I bought extra storage just to keep everything synced otherwise all my data is on google Alright, thanks!"

I can go to Google Maps and get a 1 hour link for my live location and securely send it to someone over Whatsapp, but my actual location is still being tracked by Google which is not as secure or private. Whatsapp has its own live tracking feature but after opening it, the full map it uses still says either ""Google"" or ""Apple"" in the bottom corner depending on the OS of the device that receives the location message. 

So is Whatsapp just downloading the Google/Apple map and API as a background and then overlaying your location all within just Whatsapp (as its the only app running or asking for location permissions), or is Whatsapp actually sending out your location to Google/Apple, having them generate the final map and marker, and then just displaying that?

Is there anyone with the same problem and or knows how to fix it?";2020-06-28 20:48:14;Wondering how you got on with this? I'm having similar problems. I've tried different gallery apps which do load much quicker than Google Photos, but I'm unable to multi-select media so it's very little use. I'm beginning to suspect that the probl may be to do with the number of image folders my Pixel 2xl creates. For each individual portrait photo taken, the phone creates a new folder with two images in. One background blurred. One not.

Several Bug;1;hh35sj;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hh35sj/several_bug/;1;"   
hello guys, in this post I want to report a bug that gets in the way of many people and groups, I have already reported it through whatsapp's own reporting system, but there was no feedback.    
there is a bug that causes whatsapp to crash, and that crashes even some more outdated cell phones.  So, the bug is a massive list of characters, containing links, among others that causes the victim's cell phone to crash, causes whatsapp to stop responding and often only resolves if the person who sent the message erases.    
and contacts can also be used to lock whatsapp.

   
and this is very used in Brazil to crash groups  

  
and this is usually done by modified whatsapp.  
I will be sending some screenshots 

 I hope you solve this as soon as possible, because I work with sales and I need the group where my customers are, and I've been attacked several times.

  
and sorry if there is any typo, I used google translator

US Senators introduce bill to FORCE all device and software providers in the US to build backdoors into their products. Bill would make encryption ILLEGAL unless it had a backdoor for the US government.;29;hgpkwm;whatsapp;https://www.androidauthority.com/lawful-access-to-encrypted-data-1132922/;9;;2020-06-27 11:03:42;"If you are an American, [contact your two US senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm). Tell them to vote **NO** on the **Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act**.

https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm

For non-Americans, this will also affect you, not only because a lot of software and device providers come from America, but because if the bill passes, it further establishes such a precedent for other nations to follow. Furthermore, Whatsapp development is based in the US. So at the very least they'd have to move, I would assume.

The bill is atrocious, and the EFF has already spoken out about it. It's even worse than the EARN IT Act.

Essentially, it does nothing to stop criminals from downloading and using encrypted software, or encrypting data on backdoored devices, but it does put a **huge** blow to average Americans. It certainly further sets the precedent that encryption and privacy = bad/illegal/etc. So China...
Import of all American brand mobile phones should be banned if this bill is passed similar to Huawei.

Devices made for USA shipped somewhere else will still have this backdoor so yeah ban them. Here is a change.org petition! http://chng.it/XBwkjyjkjS WhatsApp already complies with a less horrible law - the CLOUD Act. That one doesn't force backdoors but does push companies to give out user metadata, which WhatsApp has agreed to do. So the sad reality is that if this passes, WhatsApp will comply. Lol If your senator says they support the bill because ""encryption helps child trafickers and terrorists"", respond with this:

Tell him/her that this bill won't do anything to stop CP or trafficking. Criminals will just keep using non-backdoored software or put encrypted files onto backdoored devices. All this bill does is hurt average Americans, because it's a huge security risk having a backdoor. It will be used by even more criminals to access Americans' personal info. Additionally, it will hurt US companies and may cause some/many to leave. Not to mention, **we have a right to privacy**

Bottom line is it **won't stop criminals**. Considering Whatsapp is owned by Facebook, I don't recommend them for anything private. For that I recommend Signal. Signal's nice for privacy and that's about it, sadly. It lacks features even compared to WhatsApp. Personally prefer the happy median of Telegram for anything but E2E group chats. It has E2E for private ones and it has features out the wazoo, a nice balance. Hm. I find Signal good for messenging/calling/picture sharing. The excellent encryption and security come with some drawbacks, but they are acceptable to me. Telegram is useful as well."

I've contacted them to find a solution, and meanwhile I'm working on an update.

Meanwhile, a temporary solution is to download the APK from here:

[https://apkpure.com/quick-chat-for-wa-no-need-to-add-contacts/com.aukeral.quickchatforwa](https://apkpure.com/quick-chat-for-wa-no-need-to-add-contacts/com.aukeral.quickchatforwa)

On Play Store (temporarily not available):

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aukeral.quickchatforwa](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aukeral.quickchatforwa) Its a built in feature for all Android phones. Why not? Does it work with dual app? Not all Android. :) I'm an Android user too. I find 2 different apps useful. Whatever works for you üëç Tested on Parallel Space with good results, and a user confirmed me it works with Huawei's dual app.

So I'm sure it'll work in your case too, if it doesn't, you can tell me and I'll analyze if it's possible to make it work. Does it need any permission to run? It may ask for Internet permissions (it has ads) Which one should I select to send with dual app whatsapp? I'm using Note 9 fyi. Can't seem to send with dual app

[https://i.imgur.com/mbqtUcf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/mbqtUcf.jpg) By clicking ""Start conversation"" button, with ""Other WhatsApp version"" selected, it should show a dialog asking for which app to open. Depending on which Dual App you're using, it will either show something like ""WhatsApp (Dual App)"" or just ""Dual App"".

If it doesn't, I would need to know which dual app you're using to be more precise. I guess it's the one that came with your phone (Xiaomi?) Samsung Note 9 to be precise. Both ""whatsapp"" and ""other whatsapp version"" brings me to the default app. There's no pop up letting me choose between default or dual. I see. Let me look into it. Thanks man! You're welcome :). Alright, I tried to install Samsung dual app on my device but it failed. So I'll be testing on other devices and will reply tomorrow (or sooner) with a solution, if possible.

Thank you for your patience! Hi! I did all kinds of testing and research, tried with some workarounds I found, but unfortunately there's currently no method to open apps inside Samsung's Dual App. Their app is relatively new, so I expect them to add this feature in the future.

For now, I recommend you to use other Dual Apps, like [Parallel Space](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lbe.parallel.intl) (or its light version, [Parallel Space Lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parallel.space.lite)), which is proven to work with my app ([Quick Chat](https://apkpure.com/quick-chat-for-wa-no-need-to-add-contacts/com.aukeral.quickchatforwa)).

I was interested in making it work, as other users may need it too, but at the moment it's not possible. If they ever add this feature, I'll make sure to notify you :) Thank you so much for trying. Anyway I've found another app that does what I want. Good luck with your app! I like the interface You're welcome! Is there an app doing this? If so, I would be interested to know about it. Thanks for all!"

Gambling is addictive.  The reward signals to the brain rewading chemicals when the roll of the dice goes well for you.  

Csgo became popular due to implementing rng system into its mechanics and then added a case unboxing gamble in the mix too! üé∞ 

You see if the shooter was 100% accurate people would quit and not many would stay. 

Bringing the skill ceiling lower with chance is the devs way of making the game addictive even for low elo players

Although Ive aimed at the head and seen sparks fly out all over the show only to indicate 3 body shots and 0 head shots.  This scenario causes the players to rage and question their game and the game it self which further results in addiction as its like you missed your roll of the dice. 

So to conclude I think its genius what they have done.  Valorant is like a gamble and the skill ceiling has been lowered very much so to make the rng the forefront of the game further inducing addiction.

Just take a look at this and watch chance over take players and over whelm them into deeper addiction 

As its this rage that also plays apart in the addiction itself

Thats why when u aim at the head hitbox when the player is not facing you sometimes all your 1 taps will miss this is to give the other players a chance to have a more fair 1 vs 1 if u will

Some servers u go on the dice will favour u and u will have whats known as a rush of good fortune with your rng and u will feel like scream for second 

Next server you run into severe bad luck with the rng and it tilts u causing more addiction for the player

Players are more likely to buy skins during the rush phase of good fortune 

Its just variance and these things exist in the long run in probability 


https://youtu.be/1QltOwtx0QY

Enjoy
üëä

Dont take it seriously its meant to be like this to induce addiction üí•

Also bonus video to show u why Csgo took nearly 6 years to fix their hit reg (mainly why so many players got addicted)

Did I just lose all my media and chats or is there a way to get them back?;0;hgd67a;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hgd67a/did_i_just_lose_all_my_media_and_chats_or_is/;2;"So I accidentally uninstalled WhatsApp on my phone and no longer have access to the phone number I originally registered with. However, it looks like the media files and (hopefully) my chat history is still on my device. If I reinstall WhatsApp on the same device, but with a different phone number, will my WhatsApp account be reset with the new phone number, making me lose all of my old media/chats? Or, will WhatsApp be able to recognize my device and automatically migrate my media and chats to the new phone number? 

I have some very important chats I can't afford to lose so am really hoping there's a way to recover my old account - any help would be appreciated!";2020-06-26 21:33:55;"There is no official way to get them back without the phone number, I guess there is probably some way to use those files and recognize them on a 3rd party, but not on whatsapp. Firstly if you had access to the OG phone number, this would be 100 times easier since you could've just did  [https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/account-and-profile/changing-your-phone-number](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/account-and-profile/changing-your-phone-number) even without the sim but e.g if it's a friends phone number e.g you could just ask them to send you the verification code. So if it's possible do this.

&#x200B;

Alternatively, if you have an android device it's easy to find the folder with your whatsapp data. When connecting the device to your PC via USB, you will find a folder called whatsapp this has all your media readily available. Your chats however, can't be accessed so easily on your pc. Also when you reinstall whatsapp im unsure if it will offer to import your chats (it will probably detect the number is different). This is something you will have to try, if it works you're all good. If not then you have your media still....

Lastly, if you have an android device, uninstalling the app will \*not\* delete your chat data/media. Unless you select clear storage data from the app info screen."

Will an Idea 3G , 1.5GB/day net pack suitable ? 

How will be the quality and Lagging?";2020-06-26 15:51:30;It can be it depends upon your signal quality and your internet provider. I would suggest you to use a better internet connection from your family member, else it is ok to use 3g. Also, don't get a 1.5/day internet data pack. It comes costly. A whatsapp call hardly uses up 20megabytes in 10 minutes. If you plan on using the internet pack for 1 hour conversations also use the leftover for daily use it's ok. Else I'd suggest lesser data packs. Also if possible ask people about your internet provider quality before you buy. it's good to have little research before buying. Stay safe Will there be any quality issues and lagging behind if I use 3G ? There will be. Expect connection drops and low quality call. Cause ofcourse it's 3g. Overall if you're dedicated, and the other person patient enough it would work. Thanks... Anyway I already bought a 4G sim

So if you had this issue via SMS, you would kind of be in the same boat, you could either block or change numbers.

Here's another approach. It's long process but will work if you don't want to change your number.

Save few male nudes from Reddit. Dick pics and usual. Next time when someone asks for nudes, send those pics. Don't forget to tell them you're a man. Slowly, people will stop asking for nudes. Someone must have posted your number in prostitution sites. It sucks but the only way to find out is asking where does it comes from and try to denounce. Otherwise just changing number.

Blocked by Someone or did they just remove you as a Contact?;1;hfkjsu;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hfkjsu/blocked_by_someone_or_did_they_just_remove_you_as/;0;"I assume we all know what happens when someone blocks you on WhatsApp and there are many ways to figure out if someone indeed has been blocked. But I had an interesting thought come across when I was speaking to someone when they mentioned being blocked. 

Lets say that Person A is the one that see's they might have been blocked by one of their contacts, lets call him Person B, as he doesn't see Person B's profile photo anymore. 

  
Could it be possible that Person B simply deleted Person A from their contacts list?

I'm still more convinced that if you don't save someone's number and you still archive your chat with them, then you can still see their profile photo.

That's exactly whom I *should* tell to not use WhatsApp... [deleted] Signal. Telegram. Etc. [deleted] So now you mindlessly scroll Telegram. It's not the medium, it's the human. Anyone can use Signal easily. You just tell your contacts, ""Hey, I'm using Signal"" and if it's too much for that person to use that app, that person must not be a close friend. Telegram aren't incentivized to keep you on their walled garden in the same way Facebook is. [deleted] Neither is whatsapp. It's just a communications app, it has no noticeable relation to Facebook (for consumers). ? Oh, well in that case. If the consumer doesn't obviously know that Facebook is locking him in... Into what? Into using WhatsApp? And you think Telegram doesn't lock people into Telegram. Or Viber locks people into Viber? They're all after the same thing: more dedicated users.
If you don't like to be able to connect to the people you want to connect to, you should cancel any internet and phone access. Signal does not have the same goals as Facebook. Also, the Internet and phones are federated, not walled gardens. [deleted] Signal is not owned by Facebook. Whatsapp *is* owned by Facebook. Facebook is an advertising platform that wants to gather as much personal data about you as possible for marketing purposes. Signal is not. Therefore, Signal is better than Whatsapp. [deleted] There wasn't anything about addiction mentioned for several messages but since WhatsApp shares data with Facebook and Facebook will target ads and otherwise manipulate data in Facebook and Instagram feeds to encourage you to stay on those platforms, that makes it worse than Signal, which will not do that."

Even if you go beyond chatting apps and include [all social media](https://pasteboard.co/JeGwFA7.png)\* into the the figures, Whatsapp is still in third place, and Telegram is not even on top 10.

\*This graphic is by another source: Canadian app-specialized research company Appannie, in case Statista's reliability would be questioned. True, not Telegram.

I have 8 years of chats that I don't want to just throw away. It's literally stopping me from using my new phone.

Have just admitted defeat, real bummer tho as like yourself, there was years of media stored up and it‚Äôs a shame to just see it go to the side Technical answer 
iPhone saves all the data on its proprietary iCloud and internal storage (basically different type of filesystem) vs Android stores data on google drive and its own type of ondevice filesystem. They cannot be transferred to each other. 
Simpler things like SMS, phone logs etc can be as their data is not that complex.
It‚Äôs the same difference when you cannot connect  the same hard drive to Mac and Windows as they both use different file systems"

WhatsApp using my camera without my knowing...;15;hedynq;whatsapp;https://i.redd.it/ngpf0eemon651.jpg;12;;2020-06-23 15:45:50;"Well zuck needs that data. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.permission don't let them in future Its probably because one tab of the app is a camera mode, as part of some effort to reduce the friction of quickly snapping and sending pictures/video. So you either trigger it momentarily without even realizing it, or the app is just setting it up in the background so it'll come up faster.

Sometimes, if I open/close the app too quickly (on Android), I'll get a brief toast about some camera error. Might be because of some quirk of swipe gestures. did you gave whatsapp permission to use your camera? for videocalls or taking pics? It's also activating my contacts in the background... I have had multiple notifications today about WhatsApp using my camera and contacts in the background today... am I being hacked ? This could just be the app checking permissions and the contacts stuff is it updating contact info. Not a great look but these things happen. If WhatsApp had any suspect traffic, it'd be all over the news. To be clear on android the cam does NOT work if the app is not shown on screen, the video feed must be shown to the user for android to let the app acces it.

Whatsapp may ask for permission for several reasons in the background but android will not grant acces to your cam.

Test it call somebody on whatsapp video and just go back to your homescreen if you don't have PIP activated your cam stops working instantly!

Dont worry! Imagine when fb,ig,wpp be only ONE app, I hope world reacts soon and stop using those damn services coz I‚Äôm not interested... It's a messaging app. Messaging apps talk to people. People information lives in contacts. It needs to check your contacts to update your contact list. Yea i'm also waiting for a replacement... What replacement?

Just make sure you do a backup inside WhatsApp, then when you sign in on your new phone, you‚Äôll have an option to restore.

If you‚Äôre switching from android to iPhone, or iPhone to android, you cannot migrate your backup. What's the current phone, and what will the new phone be?"

Small details and make me want to get rid of this service... WhatsApp is just not a great overall messaging service when compared with others. There is no native iPad app or macOS app. Just web client which is always gonna suck compared to a dedicated app. You have to have it open on your phone most of the time or it won‚Äôt let you message from a browser as well. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why is it the standard that everybody uses now and how long did it take to get a Dark Mode?

What's app deleted contact;1;he4a5l;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/he4a5l/whats_app_deleted_contact/;2;[deleted];2020-06-23 03:26:35;"I had posed a similar question today.   
I think that if you see a person in your WhatsApp chat list or archived list and you can see that persons profile photo and their contact number in bold and you can see their status (if they've chosen to make it available), it might mean that they still have your contact number and can see the same: your profile photo, your contact number or name (depending on how they stored your details) and your status.   


If you see a grey figurehead (no profile photo), you've most certainly been blocked. Actually, profile picture, status depends on the privacy settings. You can see anyone's pic etc if they have that option on public and haven't changed so it's not a way to verify indefinitely.

 
The name you choose as a display name is the only new criteria I don't know much about, since most people save you in contacts and write what they want. 

I know I'm not blocked. That's the only way you definitely won't see their pic etc."

You don't need an account to use it, but you do need the app. I believe they recently integrated it into WhatsApp. I think their overall plan is to unify messaging across their apps.

Duplicating text replacements in WhatsApp app (MacOS);3;hdriae;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hdriae/duplicating_text_replacements_in_whatsapp_app/;2;"Is it possible to turn off either text replacements or auto-spelling correction in the WhatsApp desktop app on MacOS Catalina?

I get duplicated text everytime I type a shortcut (set in text replacement, which works fine across my iPhone, iPad and iMac -- except in the WhatsApp desktop app...). 

I have disabled spelling correction in my MacOS System settings. Every time I type some text replacement shortcut, it shows a ""pop up"" text suggestion and then just typing a space makes the text duplicate (as if it applies the text replacement + the suggested poped up text above).

Dual sim business account;1;hdq7zr;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hdq7zr/dual_sim_business_account/;5;"Hello there,

Hopefully not a too silly question. If I were to get another SIM card and register for WhatsApp business and then use it in a dual sim android device, would I need to switch to the other SIM in order to check business account messages or will it work when I'm on my personal SIM network?

&#x200B;

In case I can text on both accounts when I'm on personal SIM network, can I also use that one's cellular data to reply to business account messages or will I need to be switching?";2020-06-22 13:55:56;"Yes you can buy another sim card and make a new account via WhatsApp business application and use both WhatsApp applications simultaneously. 

Moreover, you don't need to switch networks to use WhatsApps, just internet connection will do. You'll get blocked eventually for using a business account for personal use.

You're better off cloning the app and using two default WhatsApp clientes. Therefore, I could use my personal's SIM cellular data and use the business one simultaneously? I'm asking because I plan just to get a blank prepaid SIM card and use it for the account only. I'd use cellular from my personal plan.  


Second question is, do I need anything else other than a basic prepaid card that I don't plan to top up in this case? Yes just a number will suffice. Awesome, thank you!"

Can you guys help me with an issue I am facing when backing up my data on iCloud? It was stuck at 4% for awhile then it started working and went up to 95%. Now it has been stuck on 95% for awhile. I tried contacting Whatsapp Support but could not find their phone. So, I emailed them and they have not been very responsive, I looked up the solutions online and honestly I do not wanna risk deleting my previous data or anything like that since here's a lot of valuable data on my account. What should I do for the backup to get to 100% on iCloud? Should I wait it out? I can wait a few days max but I don't know if that would work.";2020-06-22 04:37:23;"How long did you wait while it was stuck on 95 ? I use Android mainly, but I also have an iPhone. And as far as I remember, those issues happened to me. 
No big deal though, as I just cancelled the backup, then just use it as normally.
It would back up next time, or I can just force one manually anytime. I waited a few hours so far for the 95%. 

For the 4%, I waited around 12 hours (I went to sleep). Yeah there would be a risk deleting your previous data as per all the solutions quoted. Do you suggest waiting it out?"

First question, how is it occupying all this space?

Second, if a single backup is 200 Mb and the app itself is 50Mb, just HOW overall it occupies 500Mb? It makes no sense at all.";2020-06-21 10:56:57;"Check the Whatsapp folder, and there might be files occupying space in documents and remember to check the sent folder under media and documents folder in whatsapp folder. If you are rooted, you can check it out at /data/data/com.whatsapp and 500MB is not such a big deal for current gen phones  


And including in the previous paragraph. Whatsapp doesnt save everything in the SD, it saves the basic app in /data/app/com.whatsapp and the ""data"", configs, logs, etc in ""/data/data/com.whatsapp"". The chats are saved there too. the ones in the SD are just copies backups. Stickers are also saved, avatars nad other stuff. It also store there the decryption key that you can use to read the backyp chats in PC. my situation exactly. deleted all media and all previous backup. only backup left is 200mb and still the app takes 500mb.
i really don't get why so much space is occupied by the app. A simple solution, since you've deleted all the media you've had - try to reinstall WhatsApp. Try also cleaning the cache of WhatsApp itself. The chat database is stored in a hidden system folder. The ones you delete from database folder are just copied. My friend, WhatsApp sucks.... it duplicates everything, it‚Äôs horrible, it‚Äôs from the big Facebook company but it‚Äôs a disgusting app with a terrible infrastructure... sad it‚Äôs like the standard app Nope, as I said I deleted everything in there, including the backups in the database folder. the folder itself occupies almost nothing. Yeah, after some googling I found out that WhatsApp stores ALL the chats you ever had, even the one you deleted. That explains why the size is so huge and why deleting chats doesn't decrease the size at all. May be, but that's not the point of the topic either. wonder if you can still have access to those old chats you deleted I extracted the folder from data partition. 1.1 gb size, 950 MB of just chat database I guess so, that's the whole point of them keeping them. And since they're saved in an encrypted database the owner can access them with his own key (also saved inside WhatsApp data folder)."

How Can I Run Web.Whatsapp In The Background So That I Can Continue To Get Notifications Via Chrome Even If I'm Not On Web.Whatsapp?;1;hcn0n6;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hcn0n6/how_can_i_run_webwhatsapp_in_the_background_so/;5;;2020-06-20 17:19:20;Doesn't work I think since you always have to be connected with your phone. Even with the windows app you have to run it actively in a window and can't hide it. Download the Windows App. What's the point? But as long as the window is open and is minimized... it works. Maybe there's a way to run in the background or keep in system tray? There's an app which lets you minify any app to the tray: https://youtu.be/jURaKUWazeI

I'm not telling you to open web.whatsapp.com in your browser, scan the qr code from her mobile and access her phone's WhatsApp. 

Mobile hacking is illegal. Don't do it. If it‚Äôs worth hire a private investigator you will find right away what is she doing Why bother? Just leave her. You can‚Äôt.

Hacked. Was supposed to be locked out for 7 days and now for another 8 days. What happened?;1;hcb0vz;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/hcb0vz/hacked_was_supposed_to_be_locked_out_for_7_days/;1;"Long story short, someone was in my account and set up two step verification. I got them out, but I also can't get in to my account without the PIN code. Turns out you need to wait 7 days to undue this. After 5 days of waiting I saw I only had 2 days left, but now I see WhatsApp wants me to wait another 8 days. 

Why did this happen? What can I do? The email customer service doesn't seem very helpful.

I‚Äôm considering downgrading my phone to a Light Phone (a minimalist phone with text and and call only). I‚Äôve learned to adapt with all my essential apps by accessing them online.
However, WhatsApp possibly seems a little more difficult to access...

So, my SIM card and # will be in my new ‚Äúdumb phone‚Äù. But I‚Äôll still have my old smart phone.

Thank you all in advance.";2020-06-19 21:55:55;I used WhatsApp on a tablet before, so you should be able to use it on your SIMless phone.

Hey guys ! it's back to normal !! check it outt And, I thought I'm the only one who's is facing this issue. They are having problems. https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/1298388/WhatsApp-down-last-seen-not-working-privacy-settings It's been fucking around for a while. Ya, last seen not visible is a temporary bug but I read a post to make last seen not visible using a app [Unseen](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unseen.champapp) from playstore I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre removing it, I think it‚Äôs just the service is down. I‚Äôm sure they would have announced it officially and given people notice about the removal of this feature. Just gotta hang tight and see if they fix the issue. Why would they remove a feature that can be turned off (even for specific users) and that is highly useful for certain situations?

The ""online"", ""typing"", I understand. But they could add the feature to turn that off and keep the rest, there's no need to remove everything. I managed to change once and I was able to see everyone's last seen like usual, but it automatically changed back to ""nobody"". Yup, that‚Äôs what I get It's most likely a server problem on their side, they should fix it soon. Where did you find this? Where did you find this? I read an article saying that 8% of people have connection problems Sure, Let's hope so! The more likely option is that they're doing some work on it and just messed up the code somehow. Wonder what they're planning. It's working for me now. Thank god."

I was hoping for it would Atleast get unbanned after 60 days as it's my primary number and very important to me. Mine was deleted exactly 30 days after being banned, that means your account (and mine also) was deleted. Try logging in and see what happens. My acc was still banned when i tried logging in again last week. I don't think they are gonna keep it like that forever in case another person gets the number in the future so i hope I can get it back when i hit 60 days I got my account exactly on the 60th day. You'll get unbanned on 60th day too. But you will be removed from all the groups you were in. Some other guy made a thread and confirmed that the same happened with him and he got unbanned after exactly 60 days. So let's see. Bro thanks, that gives me hope. I am waiting for the 18th to log in. Let me know if everything stays the same or if they ban you again

So I'm trying to backup my chat log because I have a new phone arriving tomorrow and it's been stuck at 94% for a while, I'm not sure if it's going to work and my failing battery means once my phone is dead, it's dead.

My last backup was 9th April. What will happen if I put the sim in the new phone, re-download Whatsapp and it backs up from 9th April? Will I lose all the conversations I had since then? Will it delete them from the recipients? In which case, if I can jot down their numbers now before my battery dies and text everyone again, will it count as a new conversation or will it continue the old one?";2020-06-19 01:45:43;

I have two accounts, two different numbers, one on WhatsApp messenger and the other on WhatsApp business. Same physical phone. iOS. 

If I use ‚Äúchange my number‚Äù from WhatsApp messenger to WhatsApp business, what happens to the content on the business account?

Let say:
Whatsapp Messenger the current phone number ends with 08. 
Whatsapp Business the current phone number ends with 07. 

Both have contents and information that I need. 

If I do ‚Äúchange my number‚Äù on the WhatsApp Messenger from the phone number 08 to the phone number 07, what will happen to the content already on the 07 (the business account)?

Will they merge?
Everything will be deleted on the business?
All the chats from the messenger will be transfer to business?
How that works?";2020-06-18 00:42:51;"Bump - I have the exact same question, much appreciated if someone can help So for the record, I threw caution to the wind and went ahead and did that (i.e. I had WhatsApp Messenger (WM) with number 1 and WhatsApp Business (WB) with number 2,  and I changed the WM number via the ""Change Number"" option to the number 2)

  
It automatically unverified and signed me out of WB, and WM kept working, but with number 2. The standard number change notification was sent from WM. Interestingly, it appears that any groups that I joined from my WB number 2 are auto-joined/merged in my WM i.e. I seem to have both the old WB and WM groups now active on my WM.  


I lost access to the WB chat history, and the account associated with number 1 is closed.  


I did something a little further. I had yet another phone number 3, and I registered it on the now defunct WB app without uninstalling it. All the history from WB number 1 is now visible and accessible, except that the groups now show that I am not joined (which makes sense, since those are ported to WM number 2) I‚Äôve reached WhatsApp about this and they said:

‚Äúthe information that is originally associated with phone number 1 will be transferred to phone number 2 (i.e. groups, account settings, profile picture and status updates)‚Äù

But it‚Äôs not clear to me about what happens the content on phone number 2 after everything is transfer. 

Will everything be replaced on phone number 2 by the content on phone number 1? Idk üòê You can't merge two accounts officially. There might be unofficial methods but you would risk losing your data.

So a WhatsApp account is tied to a phone number. 

An account can either be a personal one or a business one.

You have a personal account A connected to the number xxxxx xxx08 and a business account B connected to the number xxxxx xxx07.

I'm not sure of what you're asking, **so here are both cases assuming you have an iCloud backup for both.**

Case 1: You're changing the account used by the WhatsApp Messenger app in your iPhone from A to B. You'll get logged out of account B on the WhatsApp Business app and replace the account A on WhatsApp Messenger App with account B. Your data from account B gets loaded in the WhatsApp Messenger app and no account will be linked in the WhatsApp business app. Account A will still be intact. 

&#x200B;

Case 2: You're changing the number used by account A in WhatsApp Messenger. Either you should get a warning saying the number xxxxx xxx07 is linked to account B and it won't permit or all your data in account B will be deleted and account A's number will become xxxxx xxx07 Thanks a lot! That was the answer I was looking for. 

I‚Äôll be doing this and let you know."

how is this blurry $h¬°t WhatsApp is doing to the pictrue preview on AppleWatch still a thing after all these years! it‚Äôs literally an extra step for them to do: get full res pic from server, put a blur filter above it, only show full res on iphone notification, when you long press the notification.;22;hapedv;whatsapp;https://i.imgur.com/IasdZoT.jpg;6;;2020-06-17 14:31:10;"if you want to report it too: support@support.whatsapp.com

maybe we all can get them to fix this! :) And while your at it. Ask them to allow creation of messages on the watch Erm I don‚Äôt have a Apple Watch but I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs a privacy thing, your wife sends you a raunchy  picture, you don‚Äôt feel it go off and guy next to you on the train gets an eyeful. you can reply from the watch üòÖ
there are third party apps that will let you read and write messages, but they take about 30s to connect to the phone, what makes them useless. beside ios would have such settings ... whatsapp should make it an option if this would be the case. something like ‚Äûshow preview of pictures inside notifications‚Äú I was about to add yes it should be a preference not a forced thing."

Settings > About and Help > Contact Us

Describe your problem with detailed steps and attach screenshots of necessary.

Tip: Always blur out sensitive information from attached screenshots. Always read FAQ before reporting anything.

If all this doesn‚Äôt work, you can report your bug in your Play Store reviews for WhatsApp. The visibility is much higher there.

-extract from Quora Thanks. Thought I might first ask here to make sure if it's on my side or a bug. Don't wanna overstrain the dev's bug report reading You can always try to send a bug report, but I wouldn't expect a response. Last time I've send a bug report i got an automatic response and what wasn't about my subject and when I responded back that they have answered my question wrong, they send a wrong automatic mail back again... and that is how I ended up on this reddit, by posting how horrible their customer service is XD.

I din't put work stuff on my phone and I have WiFi at home, WhatsApp is not blocked on my home WiFi.

So basically, this phone sits in my office and when I hear it chime from the other room I'll go read whatever the bosses need me to do, do it, and go back to binging on NetFlix 

Simple solution, or so I thought.

I used to have it years ago and it worked fine, but then all the data breaches happened, I lost faith, ignored it, etc. So now I just gave it there because my current work wants me to, but it's ok its own isolated phone with no personal data setup with a unique email address and on a segregated wifi from my encrypted wifi I use all the rest of my stuff on. No blocks on that network though, all is good on that end.

However I cannot see anyone, and they cannot see me.

When I first used WhatsApp I didn't have the SIM card inside my phone (because my SIM was a normal one and I needed a nano SIM) and I was using WhatsApp only on Wi-Fi for months.

Does your office Wi-Fi only allow a limited number of websites by any chance? I work at a high school so the wifi does restrict certain websites like gambling & gaming etc
It did cross my mind that whatsapp would be blocked - just seems strange to block it! When I was in school, the school WiFi had blocked almost every website (except its own website) I could think of. 

I used a VPN (Samsung Max) and was able to use it like a normal WIFi network. Oh that‚Äôs a good idea - what would be the best way to do that?

When we sent my grandparents a phone for whatsapp they ended up asking for some help from a neighbour and instead of installing their current sim the neighbour bought a new sim which was only used for the whatsapp account and because they keep the sim turned off all the time and never recharge it the sim is going to be disconnected and the number reassigned unless they talk to the service provider and tell them to stop.

I think that they can just change their number to the sim that they actually use but as I don't use the app too much I'm not sure what will happen to the ~15 contacts that they have. If the number is changed will all the contacts get some kind of notification that my grandparents have changed?

Is it also possible to choose the contacts that get notified about the number change instead of all of them?

Some advice would be really helpful, thanks.";2020-06-15 17:56:17;You do get asked whether or not you want to notify your contacts about the number change. But you don't get to pick who gets and who doesn't, it's all or nothing.

Can't wait for official WhatsApp support on my tablet that extends my phone WhatsApp account Will this mean that I can log in with my account on any device and have all my chats ready? No hustle of that shitty backup and restore functionality anymore? üò±

P.S. I'm not talking about WhatsApp web kinda features, I'm talking about iMessage or telegram kind May be research on storage to SD card too? Why can't whatsapp add smooth/fluidy chatting on Android. telegram already have that.when you don't like it,you just turn it off in the settings-animations.is a shame that iOS whatsapp is fluidy and Android is not.or maybe developers don't care about Android. WhatsApp is testing Telegram features, as usual, but 5 years later hahahah I would use different apps but everybody uses wa where I live so in the end i would have 2 apps Don‚Äôt expect too much...
Backups, I think that shit will stay there and something annoying will have to be done when u go to another device in order to get message synchronization No I think so I‚Äôm with you but remember telegram STILL doesn‚Äôt have video calling Honestly this backup and restore drives me crazy. If a new msg comes just after the backup is finished I'll have to do the entire thing again if I wanted to switch handsets. Why does such a big company like facebook have to make it so shitty!!!! Fortunately it was confirmed they‚Äôll come this year, and with surprises!! 
Finally people won‚Äôt say: ‚Äúbut tg doesn‚Äôt have video calls‚Äù üôÑüòÇ I switched to Telegram bro... not an easy task but I did.
WhatsApp has a terrible infrastructure since its beginning, so it‚Äôs almost impossible to change it completely now with billions of users. 
One of the things that make it complicated is that WhatsApp is fully E2E encrypted. What this shit means? E2E means from ONE device to ANOTHER one, just two devices involved, not several devices (multiplataform).
Some stupid ones says Telegram is insecure bc it‚Äôs not E2E by default (there secret chats that are E2E) üôÑ
Is Messenger or Instagram E2E? No, are they insecure? No Because storage costs money Telegram is way better on most of the aspects. But its that your friend and family circle will mostly be using WhatsApp. So you cant entirely ditch WhatsApp. Wait, isn't iMessage also E2E encrypted AND support multiple devices? I'm not so confident in that E2E thing. It feels like there is no encryption and that these companies are straight up lying to everyone. As if Facebook doesn't have enough of it üòÇ Exactly. It's like the same problem in US where even willing people can't switch to Android because all their friends and family are on iMessage ü§£ I think same happens with Viber. It‚Äôs E2E and multiplataform, but when u open it from laptop, you need to synchronize messages or something like that. Nothing as simple as Telegram infrastructure (whose idea was taken by other big software apps like Messenger, they now have something called Secret Conversations, guess where the idea came from) To clarify, E2EE is the practice of encrypting and decrypting messages at only the endpoints. Private keys to decrypt are kept only on users' devices and not accessible to companies, thus keeping messages private from companies.

Thus multi-device support can be achieved either by synchronizing private keys within a user's devices or generating a new key for each device. I believe iMessage takes the second approach; sending an iMessage to someone with multiple devices will send a different message to each of their devices, encrypting each message with the device key.

Since WhatsApp web is done through the web, it would be impractical to register new device keys. Instead, Facebook relays messages from your phone to the web app. And companies that I know they use it, are all private (not open source), so all this thing about E2E encrypted and higher security could be lies only. However I don‚Äôt think they lie to us in that, but facts are facts"

You can click and drag them to bottom of the screen and see there is option to release and close them.

Also you can close by this method too. Tap this bubble and a small window of the said app will open. Click the X in the corner to close the app.
Closing this bubble.


To use the pop up view again, go In app switch view (where you go to switch apps) click the icon of the app and there you have it, open in pop up view. I have no app with ""bubble"" in its name. Any other ideas? Nvm.. i already fix it.. for now..
I just reinstalled the app, and it is good now.. Notification? Then probably the 3rd party app disabled it when it was uninstalled and didn't reenable it. I recommend uninstalling any apps you don't trust, because they can be dangerous. Else they just use space, even if they go unused. Else try going to apps > permissions > other permissions > permissions > display pop-up (or display over other apps), might differ a bit per device Alright thanks. Will do"
Why unknow numbers can see my Whatsapp Statuses;5;h8pczr;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/h8pczr/why_unknow_numbers_can_see_my_whatsapp_statuses/;5;"Hello, I have a problem, why  non-scheduled numbers can see my statuses?

I don't recognize any of that people. I alredy contact with Whatsapp support and they tell that is because I share groups conversations with that numbers.  

 Because of the university they add me to many group chats.

   
I already checked and I left every possible group and they still appear in my configuration status.

&#x200B;

 Has the same thing happened to anyone? 

Oh and I forgot, the more time passes more unknown numbers appear to me.";2020-06-14 10:31:16;"This is the exclusion list for status (your contacts whom you don't want your status to be seen by). They are there because they used to be your contacts and you have now deleted them from your phone book. U may add them to ur contact, but u don‚Äôt set a name for them, so it shows a phone num. Well you're partially correct, from the photos I can distinguish my former dentist whom I haven't seen for 3 years.

But the number has already been deleted, my only contact list is Google's and he is not on that agenda (or any other that I remember). Yes. Even if you have deleted it from your contact list. The number is still saved to WhatsApp servers. You have to manually delete the numbers from WhatsApp. You can do that by removing them from the exclusion list. There are some areas on WhatsApp where you have to manually remove the data or else it will be saved like your block list, groups, and broadcast list(s). I solved it!!!
You were right, you need to do things manually.
The problem was that I errased those contacts from my agenda but never removed them from my ""don't see my statues"" list.

For everyone who has the same problem this was my solution:

1- Remove those unknown numbers from the list of excluded contacts to see my statues
2- Manually update my Whatsapp contact list, here how to do it.

Docking the WhatsApp web app on Chromebook;7;h8it93;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/h8it93/docking_the_whatsapp_web_app_on_chromebook/;6;"I know this is somewhat pedantic. I apologise.

I have been trying to dock the WhatsApp web URL ([https://web.whatsapp.com/](https://web.whatsapp.com/)) to my shelf as opposed to the  WhatsApp homepage ([https://www.whatsapp.com/](https://www.whatsapp.com/)). The web URL goes directly to the QR code, ready to scan by your phone.

*Why?*

Chromebooks allow you to create shortcuts to web pages that can be docked and launched from the shelf. More importantly, it gives you the choice of opening it in a window as opposed to a tab in the browser, giving the impression of a standalone webapp.

*What's your point? what's the difference between the two urls?*

When I save the pages as apps, the webapp url has a dinky little icon in a box that looks horrible compared to the homepage url. The homepage url has the icon scaled just right, in keeping with all other apps. This looks good on the shelf. The other does not.

*So why don't you just save the homepage with the pretty icon and use the link for the webapp? it's just there at the top, one click away.*

I tried this. The moment you launch the homepage as an app, it looks good. Once you click on a link that takes you to a new page, a the URL bar appears at the top. This takes away from the clean app feel and reminds you you are in a browser.

If you launch the webapp url  it goes directly to the scannable QR code and the URL is not visible at the top. This gives a nice clean app like look as you whatsapp to your hearts content.

*So, what do you want?*

I am not too sure how this can be remedied, short of WhatsApp changing the icon for that particular link. Again, I'm quite ignorant of how websites work, but I imagine there is an image stored somewhere that could be swapped out for the same as the other URL.

*Why post here?*

I messages WhatsApp and they replied with some generic how to use the web feature technical thing. I think it was automated. Completely missed the point.

Honestly, I think I'm having a bit of a rant. I'm not sure a subreddit for WhatsApp can do much.

But thinking about all the different operating systems, be it windows or Mac or other. We install so many different apps for our different needs, but only a few have the honour of being docked. From a companies perspective, I imagine there is a certain prestige that comes with having a dockable app. Nobody docks their antivirus or proprietary printer app.  Having an app that is docked alongside the browser, file explorer, photoshop, email, google drive etc, could only be seen as a win for the company.

This is like the books we display on our shelves at home. We share our screens with others, be it online or in person. We share them when casting, when presenting. These are the apps we reach for the most. Why would you not want your app to be amongst them?

Anyway, rant over.

Thanks for reading.";2020-06-14 02:51:31;"I don't use WhatsApp, but try [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/4xgby2/change_shelf_icon_for_website/)! As you hinted at, if you just change the line of HTML that corresponds to the web app icon to an icon image address of your choice, then once you save the shortcut, it should work. Let me know if you can't get it or need help! I actually change web page icons quite often before creating a web icon shortcut. Many apps have terrible app icons, so I rely on the ability to change icons first before making the shortcut This looks incredibly promising. I'm going to try this as soon as possible. Away from Chromebook at moment. Will get back to you to let you know how I get on.

Damn it, but if I don't think you've solved it, for sure. You absolute beauty! Sorted.

Thank you so much. This is a better solution as I've learnt something that i can apply with similar situations. Awesome! Glad you got it to work! That would've bothered my OCD as well lol All is right with the world, now. üòÑ"

The media takes a while to download though after the install. Restores messages first then downloads media in the background. When did you do the restore? Yes, but Whatsapp reports the backup file as 14 MB. That's definitely not right (it was 300 MB+), so it seems it backed-up without the media at some point...

If you had a separate login on your PC, it would mean you lost access to previous chats and, when you logged on your phone, you'd lose access to the conversations you had on PC. It's a very irritating implementation for a mass-market messenger, yes. Literally one of the main reasons why Telegram doesn't do things this way is to make sure users can chat however and wherever they want, at least according to the FAQ. It's true. They should make a stand alone app just like telegram did it. Mostly use it to copy links. We are wall waiting for it to change so the phone is not needed Type faster. Save battery. Use a proper keyboard instead of the crappy on screen touch one (?)Send screenshots from PC when working(?)

What really rustle my jimmies is the inability to use stickers.

We need a week long whatsapp shortage, so enough people forcefully change to telegram. Im sure they wouldnt go back to the green crap Behavior is kinda random. It doesn‚Äôt always disconnect that fast when you smartphone is locked. 

That said. I know you can connect your smartphone to power and if you have WhatsApp open (given web version is active) the smartphone will never auto-lock hence it will never disconnect from web version. Bigger display, real keyboard, copy and paste, screenshots, open link in full browser, etc. They want people to download their app and to increase their downloads-number. Otherwise whatsapp knows too that it s nonsense not to have such basic feature.  
Btw whatsapp-web mostly is used to share books, files and other documents which are mostly kept on the laptop or computer. Encryption wouldnt be any Problem if they made a function to export and import keys

They wouldnt even need a phone number for verification any more...

When using without phone number the exported/imported key could be your (only) identification Telegram is not encrypted or just change the battery optimization settings so it doesnt go to sleep that easy or turn off the wifi while locked Look at that comment God, forgive him.
Telegram is encrypted. Not end-to-end (which results as a headache), so it‚Äôs multiplataform. E2E is an additional security thing, doesn‚Äôt mean Telegram is insecure. 
PD: Read the paragraph when you‚Äôre about to back up on WhatsApp, messages aren‚Äôt E2E encrypted ;) Hmm I wouldn‚Äôt say this is related but ok > messages aren‚Äôt E2E encrypted

You mean when backing up there's no E2E encryption on your backups? I agree, but outside of the backups, everything's end-to-end ecrypted."

Is there any way I can export the entire chat? Weirdly, I had an old chat exported similarly and it har around 96,000 messages in it. So was there any change in the limit recently to reduce it or this was just due to some bug in the app?;2020-06-12 15:58:35;"I have noticed the same thing just now [https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/g4eyd7/whatsapp\_export\_feature\_needs\_an\_updateagain/](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/g4eyd7/whatsapp_export_feature_needs_an_updateagain/)  


I have mentioned it here. Let's hope they remove the limit again. if you find a way, please let me know Yeah I had taken the previous backup approximately around Dec 2019. Maybe thats why it worked. Hope they remove the limit again. Any idea if the mod apps like GBWhatsapp or FoudWhatsapp have similar limits? No, I haven't tried that. (Sorry for the late reply)"

Nobody really reads such old messages, so what's the point of that? Clash of clans group? I thought you meant most archived to begin with and then I saw what you really meant hahaha *eyeroll* around 32k Only 2k Just 1k.

But I have a group I haven't opened since mid February, I'm trying to break my record. 56k because my mom confiscated my phone for a month.

Maybe we should make a group and spam messages to see how much we can accumulate? 300 thats the most unreads ü§£

I tried to Force Stop it in the Apps setting but no use. I also tried to uninstall and reinstall Whatsapp but no use as well. 

Does anyone know what I can do to make it stop? The support team isn't exactly helpful with this. I'm using a Samsung.

OnePlus 7T, Android 10, newest versions of WhatsApp and YouTube";2020-06-11 20:25:02;"Could this be something to do with YouTube itself? I know PiP got broken a few times in Telegram and it was usually a sign that YouTube was trying to stop other apps from letting people watch videos without opening the official YT app. Hey, i have the same issue what i do is just go back into whatsapp and it‚Äôll still be there and i just click play and it will start to play in p/p OP did you get any solution to this? I'm experiencing this too. I'm on a Note 10+, Android 10 both WhatsApp and YouTube are up to date. I'm having this issue. Just started happening to me this week. Exactly the same as you described.

Huawei P30 Pro, android 10,emui 10.1.0.

Did you ever resolve it? Hey, thanks for the answer. I don't know. When I uninstalled YT, WhatsApp still didn't open the video in PiP, but in Chrome. It's not a big problem, but it still sucks. Hey, thank you but I tried that and it didn't work for me :/ Hey, no I tried a lot and couldn't fix it. I'm waiting till it fixes itself... If you find a fix, let me know. Hey, no still happening to me, didn't find a fix yet. I was reading that supposedly Picture-in-Picture is only supported for YouTube Premium users or YouTube users in the USA. That still doesn't explain why a friend of mine still has the future on WhatsApp and doesn't have Youtube Premium nor lives in the US. I ended up downloading YouTube Vanced to have Picture-in-Picture but still sends me straight to the app when opening YouTube links on WhatsApp. I've sent emails to both WhatsApp and YouTube, if I get any response I'll let you know. It's weird. I tested with Instagram and that works... Not sure if that helps narrow down the problem. Maybe it's also somehow a problem of specific Android versions, I don't know. With my old phone (OnePlus 7), there were no problems with PiP and also on phones of friends/family everything is working normal. I really liked that feature. Same for me, works with everything but YT. Yeah that could also be, my friend who still has the feature has Android 9, and One UI 1.0. Kinda stupid that upgrading OS and UI could've made me loose a feature but... That's android I guess (?)"

Should my phone vibrate for every single message?;6;h11h7z;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/h11h7z/should_my_phone_vibrate_for_every_single_message/;8;"Lets say a group conversation, or someone who sends messages right after another instead grouping them into one.

My phone will start buzzing at message, fucking can't stand it. 

BZZTBZZTBZZTBZZT I used to think this was a bug on my old phone but it's now on my new phone as well.

Can't find any setting for it but always thought that wasn't supposed to happen, so is it?";2020-06-11 18:29:37;"1 message = 1 notification  
1 notification = 1BZZT

that happens in any instante message app on any phone. that's why you have the option to silence groups and individual chats 'Should' is for you to decide. There's no point in crying.

You can disable notification, vibration, and/or sound. It's easier than making a complaint thread on Reddit.

Also, feel free to uninstall whenever you're fed up. Group chats turn off after the first message if there is a stream of nonstop messages. It will start quiet until you interact with WhatsApp or if there is a delay in the incoming messages. But individual chats will bzzzt nonstop. Damn, I always thought that it used to BZZT once and then ignore new BZZTs for at least like 15 seconds.

Thanks anyway. Wait what, I just thought it used to not do that. Also you can't really uninstall whatsapp in the Netherlands. It's what everyone uses for communication. Not that I want to get rid of it though, been using it for like 8 years now and it has always been pretty good imo.

Also I just hoped there was an option for just a sort of BZZT cooldown (as I thought I had it before), wouldn't want to completely silence message. But it's annoying when working to hear/feel it constantly going when someone is sending individual messages instead of one big message Bit harsh i wish it functions like that too! that's why I silence everyone except my gf and mom Maybe, if you're on android, there's something for that once you root your phone? Or on jailbroken iPhone perhaps? Like, something to bring back the notification cooldown (probably universal and not just specific to whatsapp)."

Thank you in advance.;2020-06-10 15:11:25;"No.

You need to scan the QR codenfrom the phone that holds the whatsapp account, and the phone needs to stay within bluetooth range, AND connected to internet too. It doesn't need to stay within Bluetooth range, but it does need access to the internet. Try taking a screenshot of the QR code on WhatsApp web, send it to her and ask her to open it on another device before scanning it with her phone. Keep in mind the QR code will reset after some time so you should do the entire thing without wasting time. This os a new idea i have to try. Didn't know it worked that way. My whatsapp web disconnects if phone moves away."

WhatsApp Comparison: iOS vs Android;18;h05dfs;whatsapp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzi1SE87Mj4;26;;2020-06-10 09:37:49;"They‚Äôre equally trash As an Android user I like the iOS version more I dont get why the app on android is not totally on ""dark"" mode. It's more of a dark green. My ocd does not sit well with it üò™ Nice Video of Comparison,  but it can be improved more. In my opinion, both platforms have their advantages and disadvantages. Here you can see the complete difference between [Android vs iOS](https://www.infoxen.com/blog/android-vs-ios/) What‚Äôs the purpose of the video? It doesn't look like WhatsApp at all. Not even close on iOS. I recently just moved to android (been an ios user for years). And tbh the app on ios looks so much well made. Seems to me they used the platform options like they're supposed to. The iOS version will look more sensible for iPhone users. The Android version is more aligned with the Android design ideas. 
As an Android user, the iOS interface confuses me. And that's fine as I'm not the intended audience for the iOS app.

Edit:typo seems like you are an iPhone user. Yeah, me too. Maybe it's because I have been using the android version for years. Interesting, I use both platforms and, even though both are bad in my opinion, I personally prefer the Android version, it feels more natural to use in my personal experience. That's true. Thanks for your feedback. Will improve in the next one. Do check my Youtube Channel for similar content. It shows how users of one OS how WhatsApp on the other OS works. ü§∑ Well, if you are an android user, you could see that it's not the same interface on iOS and like wise. Well that's how it looks on iOS. Glad I was able to show it to you. Yeah, it does look better. Yeah, it might be. Yes.. I‚Äôve never been toxic or something like I‚Äôve been here (you can see my post and replies if you don‚Äôt believe me) but whatsapp is stuck 10 years in the past and has never worked hard on making/fixing anything, for me is unusable, it crashes 9/10 when i record an audio message and even when i‚Äôm not doing anything at all... 
The appearance compared to other apps is awful (the dark mode........ i still don‚Äôt know what does it take to throw 10 random colors (they‚Äôre awful) into the app (they have no love for their app, if there was any they would‚Äôve been changed the look of it at least once since it‚Äôs initial launch on the app store/play store and they would be listening to feedbacks...))

On the other hand tel*gram is destroying whatsapp and that‚Äôs why they (whatsapp) decided to make the ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùdark mode‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù in the first place...

I don‚Äôt have anything against you and this reply is not an attack or things like that, i‚Äôm just writing some of the reasons why I don‚Äôt like it and I don‚Äôt recommend it

(I‚Äôve censored the teleg*am app since i‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm allowed to write about it here) >OS 

Exactly. I'd used WhatsApp on iOS way too long ago. Switched to Android since then n have never looked back. Feeling nostalgic. Such an irony that, it, still, looks the same. Hi there, it's not entirely a bad thing that they are not updating the old look. I definitely like the look of whatsapp on iOS, but I really don't want Facebook to ruin whatsapp by adding ads or like linking all the accounts (fb, insta, whatsapp) together. 
The dark mode could have been released earlier, definitely with you on that. Well, actually it's the same case in Android too. I think the major changes whatsapp had brought are the status feature and the dark mode. Other than these, it's still the same thing. The acquisition of Facebook has only made it worse... before that i‚Äôve had no problems (crashes, instability and the backups not working.... seriously.... sometimes it remains stuck for a month before proceeding)

The look is something more personal but you should definitely have choice on what colors and general appearance do you want to see and customize an app you spend so much time on, it is not difficult, really...

From the developers i see so much disinterest and something like: if the app dies they wouldn‚Äôt care at all

That is really sad to see...

I heard they want to ad ads and linking but I don‚Äôt think they would add it, everyone would stop using it

Edit: typo Yes, it's a personal opinion. I like keeping things simple. Maybe they are doing the same thing. 
And for older people, it might be easier for them to use it like that. It can be actually"

From here you should have 4 options, 1-Take photo 2-Open gallery 3-Select File and 4- sticker library. #3 & #4 are the ones I've used most. On #4 you should be able to find any sticker you have and organize it but some stickers may not appear, especially if you haven't favorited them so for that you'd go into  #3- Select File and then Internal Storage>Whatsapp>Media>WhatsApp Stickers. In that folder you should be able to see any sticker that has been used in any chat that is currently available in your phone. Good luck!

Edit: https://stickermakerapp.xyz this is the app i use I see what this might help with, but in the media folder, all stickers are just randomly sitting in there, there's no easy way to find my favorite ones and tell them apart from the other ones, is there? I was thinking of a way to export them outside of whatsapp and then regroup them as packs and import them back. Hey! I only have Choose Photo: Camera, Gallery, Text options. I cannot access old stickers Well yeah but its the best option i know, you are welcome to try anything else"

whenever i  bought a different phone i could easily restore my chat history but now after factory reset i can't see any of my old chats?? i thought my local back ups were made on my sd card but i cant find the files. 
were they on my internal storage and now gone forever?? is there anything else i can do i had some important old messages :((";2020-06-09 19:57:55;"Local backup means its in the phone storage, factory reset erases anything thats in the phone storage and boots up the original system. If you want a backup that would survive a change of phone or factory reset you have to go into WhatsApp settings>chat>chat backup then set up the google drive email and then back it up after setting it up. You must remember to do this every so often because the daily automatic backup is local and will only back up to the drive via manually selecting the option when necessary.

Edit: yes, WhatsApp stores everything in the phone by default even if you have an sd card unless you manually move the app into the sd storage in the app storage management. Unfortunately your data is lost. oh, i don't know why i thought that local backups would be in external storage instead of internal storage. i had chat history of the last 5 years... after this i will make sure to back up messages to my drive account, thank you for your reply !!"

WhatsApp is making conference calls without instigation from anyone in the group.;7;gzl3v8;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/gzl3v8/whatsapp_is_making_conference_calls_without/;14;"Oddball occurrence. Twice now my family has received a conference call linking all my brother and sisters, yet none of us are actively requesting the call. We have multiple groups, but this has only happened on 1 group.

I‚Äôm posting this after confirming just now, with each individual, on normal phone ‚Äòone to one‚Äô via mobile. Nobody instigated the call. I was physically on anther call when it rang via WhatsApp.

Even more bizarre, I could actually hear my brothers room where his phone was on a shelf and untouched. As in the call CONNECTED and the microphone was active on his phone. I could hear him having a meal and watching tv. He was totally unaware and had certainly not touched his phone. 

My sister was cooking and totally positive she had NOT instigated the call. She did answer and we did talk.

Afterwards I immediately received a WhatsApp message asking me to rate the call.

Reddit? This is very weird. Has anyone any info regarding this?";2020-06-09 14:14:31;"Further information- this 2nd event is the 2nd conference call EVER made by anyone in the group. Nobody in any other group had utilised the conference feature. We do not use WhatsApp that way. 

My brother confirmed the phone was on a shelf next to his car keys. He had not touched the phone since entering his house well over an hour prior. It should not have connected the call. I could clearly hear him at a meal during the call. It disconnected without him being aware after about 30-45 seconds. I have checked as much as possible, it would appear my sister instigated the call. His she claims she did not do, and clearly recalls the phone being on charge at her kitchen bench. Again the phone is totally untouched on the bench. She is very sure she did not accidentally create the call. 

This is likely true due to the multiple efforts required to create such a call on WhatsApp. Her home is pin protected, then you have to open the app, then choose the option. 

The first time it happened ( almost a month ago) we were surprised, but put it down to happenstance. A ‚Äòpocket call‚Äô if you like. Yet it is remembered as very unusual. It was the first time we understood such a thing was possible.

This? This is not ok. To the best of our knowledge the call was NOT created by any of us. And there is the issue of my brothers phone connecting while sitting on a shelf. Zero contact possible.

Is this a bug? Or should we be more concerned? Hmm, there was a very similar or even identical bug last year, where a hacker could call someone's phone and hear them just fine even without the user picking up. I think there was something else, like accessing the account through a call, but not 100% sure.

Has either of you received any weird files or messages lately? In the last month or so. Are any of you using Android? I'm stuck on the thing with your brother's phone. This is basically impossible on the iPhone unless the app was left open and the screen unlocked. On Android, it would be possible (if unlikely) to have some sort of control software on the phone and use it to initiate the call. This is not something I would tend to assume is WhatsApp's fault. If you check the call history on WhatsApp, the first name that shows up in that group call is the one from whose device the call is started. May help you in identifying the issue with that device. It has happened to us, too.  My sister's iphone has whatsapp called my android several times and my eldest brother's iphone has whatsapp conference called us all. My sister keeps hers in her pocket and my brother and  I leave ours on the tables near where we sit, so nobody was actually touching the phones any of the times this has happened. very weird. We have never found an answer for it. As an update. There is 3 iPhones and my brothers is android. All are pin locked after a time period. My brothers is the most suspect due to where the app is located on the screen ( think pocketcall) but the instigating phones are my sisters iPhones. One call from each. Wasn't that a FaceTime bug though? I‚Äôll check, but am I asking if it came via WhatsApp? ( I know I haven‚Äôt) Good to know that what is happening to us is not a one off. No, so far I cannot find a reason. Maybe it was on FaceTime too, but there was definitely a WhatsApp one. Hmm, not necessarily. Any weird messages, links, attached files could compromise the device. It's more likely to be on WhatsApp since that's what seems to be affected but it could be an email or a Facebook message or whatever. We all have different security software on our phones and we all keep our phones locked when not in use. There is also no history of the calls to be found on any of our phones. We can't puzzle this one out easily...and we've checked throughout the family and nobody we are realted to or friends with works for any of the phone companies  and is pranking us (something that used to happen back in the 'Ma Bell' days with a cousin working for AT&T that would splice the lines and call everyone in the family for a family conference call). This has been happening since February with us. May for us. Did any of you get a ‚Äòrate this call‚Äô box from WhatsApp appear after the call ended? I did, both times. Yes."

This is the second time this happens. I leave messages for my boyfriend (who sleeps a few more hours than me) on Whatsapp in the morning and he answers in the afternoon. About 3 hours after I send them it shows me that they're all read. Basically, the 2 ticks¬ø are blue. However, he did NOT read them. He wasn't even online the entire day. Is this a bug? Has this happened to anybody before?";2020-06-08 16:41:54;"2 possibilities
- someone has logged on to WhatsApp web on computer and checking his messages 
- he is checking your messages in sleep and forgetting about it On his phone, go to [Settings > Whatsapp Web/Desktop]

From there you can see if his account is being used on another device (Mac...etc.) Well he probably pressed ""Mark as read"" on his notifications. It doesn't say when he was last online but it shows that he has seen your message. Is he himself logged on to whatsapp web on a computer? Technically, ""read"" just means the message has been displayed on a screen, not that a human has seen it. (Now that I think of it: Is it possible that your message was actually displayed on his phone while he slept?)

If he goes to the settings menu in the phone app and then WhatsApp Web, it should show all devices logged in to his account and the option to log out all devices. If he's concerned about it, that would be the first step. Maybe change the password at the same time. If it still happens after that, then I'd be curious if it happens when he's logged out of all devices including his phone. He was asleep at that time, not using his phone. Probably should have mentioned that in the post as well. Thank you! Never seen this before, maybe try making a group chat with just you and him and see if it continues?"

Recover chats from disconnected sim;1;gyt76j;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/gyt76j/recover_chats_from_disconnected_sim/;0;"Hi, 

I lived for a year in a foreign country and used a local sim (together with my home sim, in a dual phone sim). Also, I installed parallel WhatsApp on my phone, and used it with the foreign sim while I was there, while also using the home sim for the contacts in my home country. In hindsight I should have used only one WhatsApp, I just necessarily complicated things. 

Fast forward almost two years later, now back in my home country. The parallel WhatsApp continued to work after I cam back (even though I didn't really use it anymore) until very recently when I opened it and it told me that it needed to confirm the number. I guess what happened was that my foreign sim was reallocated to a different user, which claimed it for their WhatsApp. 

I was able to find all the Media from the parallel WhatsApp in the phone, but I don't know how to find the chats. There is a folder structure, where I found the media files,  but I am not sure where to look for the chats. Also, the chats where backed up in Google Drive, but I don't know how to locate them there either. It is also impossible to restore from backup as I don't own that phone number anymore. 

Is there a way to recover the chats, either from the phone or from Google Drive? 

Thanks!";2020-06-08 08:54:04;

Unless you backed up. Whatsapp keeps backups of last 7 days, in the local folder of your Phone. You can rename one of them to restore that specific version.  


When did you delete that chat? I have daily backup enabled but the chat goes back almost a month. I tried re installing the app and recovering backup but couldn't recover the said chat About a month back, dont think it will be possible to recover it now, sed... Not sure about ios but on Android, there are usually multiple backups made for each day (by default) you can check for older backup files and use those to restore instead of the newest one, it won't be fully up to date but you'll get back the majority of your chat history, ifffff you can get the older backups I'm on android as well but the oldest backup (I'm assuming the db.crypt database) is till 31 may. The chat was of before then. I dont think I can recover it then."

Hope that helps Hello, here are a few steps that could solve your problem

1. cancel the download
2. Turn wifi off and back on
3. Start the download
4. If the same problem happens continue to step 5
5. Hard reboot your iDevice, if it is iPhone 7 or below try holding down the Volume down button and the lock button. If you're using a notch kind of device, iPhone X and above, click volume up then volume down then hold the power button and keep holding it till the apple logo shows up. 

Hope this helps. I don't know if this will really help or not but I suggest turning off the wifi so that you can stop the installation then delete the app and redownload it again.
I hope this helps (although i  thought iPhone users don't need to use WhatsApp cuz they already have a messaging app) I am an iPhone user and rarely use iMessage as I live in India and everyone uses WhatsApp. Also, WhatsApp is superior than iMessage I tried that this morning. Thing is, the app isn't even installing. It's just stuck and unresponsive to anything I do. in a third world country.. everyone uses whatsapp In the entire world, besides USA, everyone uses WhatsApp.... true that! carrier companys gives free unlimited data for whatsapp.. including videocalls and voicecalls as a way to keep customers with them Really? I have unlimited data for WhatsApp, YouTube, Netflix, Instagram, Spotify, Maps, etc. but VoIP still counts against my cap. Always found it weird since I have unlimited calls also. I even get unlimited texts but it's probably been more than a year since I've sent a text. i said when you ran out of data from your plan"

Hackers are not only hacking people's lines but now they also hack a whole group page completely. Once they succeed in doing that, they will immediately remove all the Admins and thereby become the only Admin of the page. In such a situation, it is either you remain with their fraudulent posts or you start the process of creating a new platform thereby losing all the information you had in the former. 

So anyone who is an admin to any group to quickly do the following now before they hack the page 

&#x200B;

As an Admin, u need to be one step ahead of the Group Hackers/Hijackers.

&#x200B;

\* Go to the Group setting

\* Go to edit Group info

\*Tap on only Admins can set.

Then tap on ok.

So while they can't collect your data like what you write or see the media you share, they can see who you write to and what kind of file types you share. They can see when you're online and who you talk to most often, where you and they are located, which phone model you use, etc. There's enough of it to have a comprehensive profile on any user and figure out who they are. Metadata is incredibly valuable and sells for a pretty sum to advertisers and governments. Thank you for you comment.
Things make more sense now.
On the same line, Is signal app better in comparison to WhatsApp for privacy? Yeah, it's not owned by Facebook so it's not likely to be selling metadata to any shady companies. Encryption-wise they're identical. It lacks features though, so if you want an app that's like WhatsApp and even better, I personally prefer Telegram for day-to-day communication."

Let me tell you though, if your gf needs to be this controlling, the problem is not your privacy status on WhatsApp lol That setting is hiding your only ""last active date on whatsapp"". If you turn it on, you cant see others too. There is nothing to hide your online status, yet. (Only if you block someone) Even if you block here, she can see your online status from another phone. Your best bet is to deactivate your whatsapp number (from within the app), then get a new number and re-install whatsapp.

You will not be able to keep your existing whatsap messages. So you should export them using the built in (very easy) export to email.

This way, whatsapp won't let your GF know that your number has changed.

You will also need to rejoin any groups.

1- Delete corrupt backup file from Google Drive
2- Force fresh WhatsApp backup from old phone into Google Drive
3- Insert SIM in new phone
4- Install WhatsApp in new phone
5- Launch and follow all setup steps

A fresh install of WhatsApp was needed after inserting the SIM card, since the old one kept trying to redownload the old corrupt backup in Drive.

Such a relief.
:-) Had the same issue, all I did was delete whatsapp off my phone and select to delete the saved data (this is not the same as the saved data your trying to restore). 

Download whatsapp again, enter your number and now it gives you 2 options for permissions, select yes for both and now it will download all your saved data from google drive. Hi, you're 100% right about this solution not being anywhere on the web. Though I have some questions if you don't mind

1) ""Delete file from Google Drive"" -- How do I find it, in what folder is it stored?

2) ""Force fresh WhatsApp backup"", what files are to be copied? I found in my phone 6 or 7 similar files (similar in size and name), you mean the newest one?

3) Just curious about this one: Isn't there a way to fresh install whatsapp on the new phone and replace it's whatsapp database with the one on the old phone? Wouldn't this save time since uploading to G. Drive wouldn't be needed?

Thanks a lot!! 1. In the Google Drive app, on the left side menu one of the entries is 'Backups' (between 'Notifications' and 'Settings')
2. In Whatsapp, go to Settings>Chats>Chat Backup, and click on the Back Up button.
3. There is a way (in theory), but navigating that proved to be a nightmare due to the user-unfriendly filenames of the multiple backups, so this seemed more accessible to the least computer-literate among us :-P

Hope it helps!

Whatsapp desktop notification does not open chat window;4;gwyjdq;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/gwyjdq/whatsapp_desktop_notification_does_not_open_chat/;4;"I installed Whatsapp desktop on my new laptop. 

Usually, when I clicked on message notification pop-up, it will open the chat window. Now, when I click on the notification, nothing happen except getting rid of the pop-up.  


How do I set and open the chat window again? I have enabled all notifications on both desktop and phone app options";2020-06-05 08:29:39;"Yes, I am having the same issue on Win 10 1909 and just updated to Win 10 2004 and have the same issue.

I tried uninstalling WhatsApp and reinstalling but the issue is still there. 

It's so annoying as its just a habit now to click on the notification, but recently nothing pops up. Just found this fix, worked for me:

&#x200B;

Run Whatsapp in Windows 7 compatibility mode...

To  do this in Windows 10, close Whatsapp. Right click the Whatsapp icon in  your start menu or start menu tile, click ""more"" from the popup menu,  then ""Open file location"". Then right click the Whatsapp short cut that  should be displayed, click ""Properties"", click the ""Compatibility"" tab,  tick ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" and select ""Windows  7"", then click ok and restart Whatsapp and your notification popups  should open the messages they are for. There were no replies and I thought I was the only one with this problem. 

I had an old WhatsApp installer file which I use and it works. 

So it is probably the new WhatsApp version which does not allow the chat window to pop up. Weird... Strange no one else has had the issue. I use that function hundreds of times a day ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

2 check marks;1;gwtdza;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/gwtdza/2_check_marks/;6;Hello reddit community. I have a question.

How is that possible?;2020-06-05 02:55:17;They have probably disabled it, which means they also can't see when you have read their message.

Can you give me an example?

It probably was send to them but just send the same message again and if they ask you about it just tell them what happened. I am absolutely certain about the fact that it was sent properly. When you push the send button the message will go it‚Äôs way. Deleting the app does not anything about this, your user account does still exist though you deleted the app. So the message will go through

I‚Äôll be honest. I Didn‚Äôt fully understand your question Changing the number doesn't help because the number on the tablet is data only. So I'm stuck on the issue, which was having WhatsApp send a verification code to a data only device. Which is why I used my cell number and now the tablet has my WhatsApp account. So no matter what I do to the tablet. Uninstall then reinstall, try a new SIM. It still comes back to mine. The number doesn‚Äôt have to be associated with the tablet. You can change the number inside WhatsApp to your dads or moms or whoever will be mainly using the tablet. I understand you put your own number to register without realizing what will happen, but you can still change it to any other number.

Sometimes when you delete media from WhatsApp window, the deleted files shows like 'unsupported media' in phone gallery. Just long press to select and delete it from phone gallery. I've had this exact issue as well Hi, I've had the same problem. It disappeared in two weeks, but I think you can delete the whatsapp cache and maybe it'll disappear 

\[sorry for my bad english\] yes¬≤ thats wht i do, i delete a lot of stuff and then that things happen. How do you solved this problem? do you knw the apps name? cant find it tho Try to find the folder from files in your phone or try to connect your phone to a laptop and delete it from there. No, i delete the media in gallery not from WhatsApp window. The corrupted media doesn't exist anymore in my gallery but whatapps still show corrupted file. I had this exact issue and they do not show up in the phone gallery how you solved it brother? I can't find ""Media Flush"" anymore. Try ""AZ Media Rescan"". Or just search for ""rescan"" in the app store and pick one you like. will try that one later"

I use Tinder pretty frequently and sometimes I exchange phone numbers. When this happens, obviously I can see their WhatsApp profile picture and some information behind the number on WhatsApp.

This time, a contact gave me their phone number and I added them, but there was no profile picture to be seen, nor any other information. This gave me a very eerie vibe. Maybe I am bit paranoid but something feels off; this is the first time it's happened. I know my ex is a crazy stalker and she even called me one day to say ""HA I FOUND YOU ON TINDER"" so I have reasons to be suspicious. 

Anyway, this contact feels off. Why don't they have a profile picture or any other information available? Is it something on my end? Did they not add me? Maybe there's some setting I'm missing on WhatsApp. 

I'm lost. Just want to check this is a real person and not some crazy stalker ex on some other phone, lol.";2020-06-04 13:15:54;"Try searching that person's number on truecaller or facebook.

Accidentally deleted all photos while clearing my storage;6;gwe7ci;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/gwe7ci/accidentally_deleted_all_photos_while_clearing_my/;14;"So I was clearing my storage because it was full and my xiaomi phone recommended that I delete WhatsApp ""junk files"". Turns out those 8 gigs of ""junk files"" where my photos. My WhatsApp is backed up weekly but I can't find anything in google drive. What can I do? Surely my photos have to be on google drive somewhere.";2020-06-04 12:34:15;"You're screwed. Usually the backup isn't visible on your Drive, as far as I know. 
But if you back-up weekly (and have the media option turned on) I think it you delete the app and restore back-up it should work. Root your phone. Recover the photos. 

Photos can be recovered from a rooted Android phone. You're lucky you own a Xiaomi. The reason I say that is because they can be rooted ( most of them except few mediatek variants). And the probability of recovering data from rooted phones are higher than non rooted phones. Please be careful while unlocking the bootloader and rooting it. Else you might brick the device and lose it altogether. If you're aware of how to do it, do it, else take it to someone who can do it for you. I have backed up everything to Google drive but I don't know what's the name of the folder where they backed up

Edit: why downvote? (because reddit that's why) I did root and install a custom rom but i reverted to miui because it was getting more frequent security updates. check [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com), hopefully you have G Photos backup on! That's a good thing that you're getting security updates. 

Did you revert because when you updated it, it soft bricked your phone?  
Cause that happened to Me once. Just leave it at that... I enabled backup in Google photos for the WhatsApp photos folder (because it was disabled). Hopefully it will work. I really didn't have anything important. No I never soft bricked my phone. I installed twrp and then lineage os and then I reinstalled stock miui recovery and miui. It was a long while ago so it doesn't matter. If you did, that's great. And an advice, NEVER trust those cleaners, from any company nor in Android or PC unless they explicit tell you what they are going to delete. Is pain though the constant notifications of space that can be ""freed"" Yeah I never installed those sketchy ""ram booster 2021 with antivirus software"" kind of apps but this was what my phone told me and I thought xiaomi knew what they were doing. So yeah, my photos are there somewhere I just can't see them. They know what they are doing. Its just that some people want to keep their sent photos and memes while others doesnt. Same with browser cache. I dont delete firefox cache just to get free 500MB cause i use almost the same sites and it would just have to download everything again, while for other people. specially those who have low space, that's trash and can deleted no problem.

CCleaner on desktop is the same. Is useful, but you have to check what they are ""suggesting"" to delete and decide what delete and what not."

I tried it and it works. If you don't want to spend on the app, there are few freeware programs which can accomplish it, but you'll have to spend quite some time on testing them. You can do backups in you google account but you need to use the same account to get the backup in the new phone.

Not sure if that is what you are looking for. Dr.Fone too. Tested and approved. Use definitely this. I tried it and it worked. Thank you very much Is there a way to do that from iphone? I want to transfer from iphone to android and ios only allows backups to icloud not google drive. I aslo could not find a way to download whatsapp chats from my icloud to my computer. Avoid Dr Fone. I used this, it successfully transferred the data ok, but I had connection problems all day long (msgs not sending/receiving) and after some time I found out that it installs a second unofficial version of Whatsapp which doesn't even let you back up to google drive. Who knows what else the app is doing with my data. Did you find anything? Trying to help my mum On iPhone? That doesnt make any sense Yes I did. I used an app called wazzapmigrator. Here are 2 useful links
https://youtu.be/W7bpxMw0j8I
https://youtu.be/5XLUoRIX7ag
It is the second method in the second video. But be aware that only text messages will be transferred (at least that was the case for me). Meaning that videos, voice notes, links and other media were not transferred. I tried to use Dr fone but it is expensive and I am not 100% sure that it will work.
Let me know if you run into any snags. This was on Android (xfer from iphone to pixel). After doing the xfer process with Dr Fone, I started having all these weird connection issues and couldn't figure out what the hell was going on. Eventually I went to Google's app store to find Whatsapp, and just downloaded it. It downloaded as a completely separate app, so I now have 2 of them on my android. 

I'm reading on these transfer apps, seeing [how they have to install older versions of whatsapp](https://www.wazzapmigrator.com/faq/how-update-whatsapp-after-migration), which might be the case for dr fone. But [Wondershare's documentation](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/android-whatsapp-transfer-backup-and-restore.html) is written in broken english and mentions nothing about this. iphone wouldnt let the app install said 2nd whatsapp version.. thats what I used and worked flawlessly"

So the thing is.. I want to change my WhatsApp number and there is this stranger I blocked weeks ago because he was threatening me... Anyway, I decided to change my phone number cuz I have to give my current number to my mother, but I'm afraid that when I do, my blocked contacts will get unblocked and this guy will keep messaging the previous number and mom will see the texts...
Guys,if you can help me please, tell me how can I block someone from my old and new number so that they could never text me or the previous number ever  again! (Knowing that he uses an iPhone)
Sorry if I wasn't clear enough, English ain't my native language... But please any advice will be appreciated. 
Thank you.";2020-06-04 00:48:07;

can I recover deleted msgstore files? I've accidentally deleted all of my messages.;1;gvtzub;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/gvtzub/can_i_recover_deleted_msgstore_files_ive/;0;"Let me preface this by saying that I absolutely know I'm an idiot. I'm just hoping that there's a way to undo my idiocy.

So, for context, I have a Sony Xperia E5 (F3311) running android 6.0. My phone is kind of old right now, and needs replacing. The internal memory is between 96-99% full on a good day, despite having every scrap of media that CAN go on the SD card on the SD card.

To save space, I've been deleting the old msgstore.crypt files, because they take up a hundred megabytes at a time, and that's insane. I regularly clear out that folder entirely, but there's never been an issue because all my old messages are still there.

However, I've been having problems with another app (Simpson's Tapped Out), and I thought clearing the data and redownloading it fresh might sort it out.

I cleared the data for Tapped Out, and it freed up about a gigabyte of memory. I thought I'd be clever and install a few updates for my other apps before I redownloaded. One of the updates was for WhatsApp.

This morning, I open up WhatsApp, and all of my messages are gone. There's just a list of groups that I'm in, all of which are empty.

I've been trying to find a program that will let me restore deleted data. So far I've tried dr.fone, and FoneLab for Android.

dr.fone said it would root my phone while it's running, and then unroot after it was done. But after it finished running, it said it couldn't do anything because the phone was unrooted. I tried to root it with the in-program tool, but it said it couldn't be rooted.

FoneLab recovered a ton of photos that I had no idea were on my phone, which was interesting, but can't do a deep scan for deleted content because the phone is unrooted.

I'm currently trying to root it with KingoRoot.

Can anyone help? Is there any program that I can use to recover my msgstore files? I honestly don't mind paying for a program if it will actually recover them. This is the big problem I had with FoneLab - it won't recover deleted material until I pay for it, but I don't want to pay for it if it won't recover the deleted items!

Again, let me stress, I know I'm a moron, but can anyone please help?

Thanks!

Update:

Can't root my phone - I've tried KingoRoot on the PC and the apk, and a couple of others. Apparently you need to be able to unlock the bootloader, to be able to root the phone, and apparently this phone doesn't have an unlockable bootloader.

I'm legitimately devestated.";2020-06-03 16:32:03;

I have not clicked on ""new number"" in the WhatsApp app because I know that alerts anyone that had me as a contact -- hey, so and so has a  new phone number which I want desperately to avoid. 

I am using an Apple Iphone 11. 

Thank you in advance for your help.";2020-06-02 05:48:24;"You will need to set up a new account and deactivate your account. 

This will mean that all your existing chat history will be lost.  You will also be taken out of any groups that you are a member of.  

You could take a copy of the chats using the export chat option. But you will not be able to import these back. 

By opening a new account, whatsapp will be unable to notify your contacts automatically of your new number and you will have to notify them individually. 

You will effectively be a new user.  You will have to rejoin any groups you are a member of. I believe u may leave your phone number out, if you are not able to, put your complete profile on private like any other social media network. Ok. Just doing my best to help. Use Telegram and problem solved, not this sh** we all have to use.  You can choose who sees your photos, status, phone number, etc. Making exceptions in each Don't add it to your profile or better yet, make your profile private. I think u should just block the number. U shouldn't be changing ur whole account cauz of just one contact. Thank you! This was the answer I was looking for. Didn't care about the old chats, just wanted a fresh start and for this particular contact to be notified. It was a safety concern. Thank you so much, appreciate the help. Exactly. Why are people not using Telegram remains a mystery to me

! So when you switch to Telegram all of your contacts automatically get Telegram too? 

Wow amazing. Sorry I didn't understand - I thought everything was done through the phone number for whatsapp? ...that‚Äôs not how WhatsApp works Easy to know the reasons, bro. WhatsApp came to market in 2009, Telegram in 2013. WhatsApp (Facebook) invests millions on advertisements than in making its services better, Telegram is open source, invest 0 dollars in advertisements :)"

Got a weird whatsapp video call;5;gug0e8;whatsapp;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/gug0e8/got_a_weird_whatsapp_video_call/;2;"So I repeatedly got video calls on WhatsApp from my boyfriend while we were in the same room. At first I thought that he had pocket dialled me. Later we were sitting together and
I got a video call from him again while his phone was on the table. We checked the phone and the call wasn‚Äôt being made from his phone. After multiple calls, I decided to answer the call but it ended up just being a dark screen and it kept saying connecting. This was really weird and I‚Äôm hoping someone can help me figure this out ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è";2020-06-01 10:23:01;That sounds like someone else had access to his account and was contacting you. If it happened once, could have been a bug, but repeated calls seems like foul play for sure. Has he received any weird messages or files lately? It's weird if someone used his account he would be locked out from it so I assume it didn't happen
