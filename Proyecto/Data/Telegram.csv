Android 11's bubble messaging;2;l6gnrs;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l6gnrs/android_11s_bubble_messaging/;3;"Recently I've received the Android 11, and the Telegram seems support the bubbles, but the integrations is poor. The Telegram just added support to the API, but didn't adapt the interface.

Some problems that I found:

* The back button on the Telegram interface should be hidden and disabled! If someone touch it, the bubble crash and it just works again if forces close the Telegram.
* The emojis or stickers page is occupying the entire screen instead of just a part.
* The groups bubble doesn't show the icon.
* The popup from bubble is occupying almost entire screen, instead of just some part.
* Doesn't have any button to open the app if I want have more options (the notification will just open the bubble, so we need this button)
* the interface must be simple, but have the essential (no option to open the profile or others options).

I'd like so much to give this feedbacks to the Telegram's team, but the Telegram doesn't have any official channel that I can white 🙄

They say, this update will be revoked from the AppStore until it's really ready for release on all platforms I got this update.. You can actually use the chat export feature of WhatsApp and push it in a existing contact in telegram.. Pretty cool..
They already reverted the update but I managed to get it (iOS) I love that you drop the news but you have no idea if it’s true and also is not even your screenshot... lol. Whatever: it’s true, I just tested it and I should warn you: your clients will suffer and crash until sync it’s completely done. I’m glad this is on the way. I’ve been saying for ages that telegram and signal should be exploiting the fact WhatsApp let you export chats while they still do just tried it. It’s awful if you already have been chatting with the person in telegram. all the historic really old chats from whatsapp will appear as the most recent chats of the chat list, like they were just sent. Telegram will show you the original date they were sent, but they will appear as they were sent Today. It’s true, I just updated Woah, how can I do this? This is awesome! The ios version I have just installed didn't have the option for moving chats As u/groosha said, I thought they were going to revoke it - but they published v7.4.1 instead, with a smaller changelog but apparently the same functions. No idea why I love that you drop the news but you have no idea if it’s true and also is not even your screenshot... lol. Whatever: it’s true, I just tested it and I should warn you: your clients will suffer and crash until sync it’s completely done. Also, if your chat history differs from the other person, your differ chat will be “pushed” to the others person history. So they might find differences. The merge seems to be done seamlessly. And a label “imported” will be added to the time of the msg. Yeah, this time they pushed it way too early and didn't expect apple to move so quickly 🙃 Aha thanks mate Hey, could you tell us how you exported chats from WhatsApp on iOS? The sole backup option i see is iCloud. Could that be possible on android too? To export chats from WhatsApp to Telegram. I want to know, thanks!

Because I'm right now thinking that it has something to do with iOS itself. how does it works..? it is seemless..? Android or ios? Cuz I can't see the update info in play store It seems that the update is just for ios for now You’ll be able in a near future, it’s not ready yet. I was also surprised with this decision open any chat in WhatsApp / tap the name of the profile / go to the bottom where you have ""Export Chat"" On iOS WhatsApp you just go to the profile page of the person and there is an export chat button which will export to a text file.

I presume telegram are just gonna use this  to import the chat, but until I may be wrong It will, just wait a little more. iOS update was something like a mistake. from the looks of your pic, it's iOS. I didn't take the screenshot as i said in the title yes I got that from what you have written. 

I was telling you that from how the **download bar** is on the right side and blue colored, it should be from an iOS device. Yeap got it :3"

So uhh technically my account got replaced somehow. i can even see her chat, and all my old chats are deleted. When looking thru profile, I can see her face, etc. What should I do???

I dont believe i got hacked, in one of the chats it said, ''I need to borrow my father's phone first because my phone is broken'', then they conversate as normal in the group chat.

I am more concerned about all my data and all my pics in my old telegram would be lost..";2021-01-26 16:15:53;They just signed into your account using your old phone number, that they own now. In the future only use phone numbers you currently own and set up 2fa Have you lost control of the phone number associated with the account? yes, it was my number back in my last living country This is why you should put a passcode (Two step verification) on your account...they would not be able to register on a new device minus entering th code.  Now since you have access to the account, you can lock that person put by adding a passcode under security settings then select two step verification. That will lock her out yep will do this. thanks Can she do that without phone verification? She would be stealing her account now. You shouldn't do this now in my opinion, that's basically stealing her new account or restricting her phone number from creating an account.. you should've switched your phone number in telegram before, or do that now You should also change the phone number on the Telegram account to your current one. If you ever get locked out of any device or need to log in to a new one, Telegram will always send an SMS to the associated phone number, which currently, you don’t have access to. There's also a section that shows devices, use it to log out all other devices. (Do this after adding Two step-authentication) You don't need the phone to add two step.

Unpopular opinion: stories on Telegram would actually be quite nice;1;l5bxxd;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l5bxxd/unpopular_opinion_stories_on_telegram_would/;9;[removed];2021-01-26 14:11:17;"Go back to instagram then. You can a) make your profile private and b) create limited distribution lists for your stories. I still don't see why would you want to have stories in messenger.

Stories is more of a social network feature, where you have a public profile and post things about your life, whereas in messenger your concentrate on private communication, like in email, for example. Why would I need stories in email app?

Furthermore, I use my account for personal and business purposes. And if I'd like to use stories, I'd have to customize privacy settings a lot to explicitly select who can and cannot see my stories. It's just too complicated for a minimalist messaging app, which is Telegram, in my opinion. My opinion is if they add them they should NOT take a prominent part of the UI.

I wonder if people screaming ""telegram is a messenger, stories don't belong here"" are aware of public channels with multiple thousands followers? Do they not belong on the messenger as well?? I've never used Instagram, but I assume ""stories"" are similar to Facebook news feeds, which update you about what's going on in the lives of all your friends.

I do agree that this ""stories / friends news feed"" function would be useful.  

However, when people first create a new account, the ""stories"" function should initially be OFF, and people should be required to manually turn it ON if they want to use it (and have the ability to turn them back OFF if needed).

This is because many people do NOT want their ""all chats"" page flooded with ""stories"".  

And studies have shown that many people become depressed / jealous / unhappy because of social media stories / feeds. Telegram is a messenger, you know. Not a fucking social network. I do find Telegram less minimalist than Signal or WhatsApp and find it quite the opposite: you have channels, groups that are bigger and better moderated than other messaging apps and has a nearby feature to meet new people that is more common on social networking sites. Telegram is well known to focus on features people like than privacy itself, WhatsApp users love stories i think Telegram could add Stories but better. and i hope it will always remain like this ! Amen."
(Discussion) How could Telegram UX/UI be improved to welcome this massive influx of new users and new usages regarding channels and groups?;14;l5bo59;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l5bo59/discussion_how_could_telegram_uxui_be_improved_to/;15;"Hello there,

This decision was already in the making for months but following the recent WhatsApp disaster and the massive migration to Telegram and Signal, we decided to finally stop our Facebook page and focus on our Telegram Channel to communicate with our patrons / followers (we are running a nightclub / music label).  


I think a lot more of businesses or collectives will soon follow as soon as they will realise that they can finally have an unfiltered access to their followers (unlike IG or Facebook where the posts are algorithmically chosen) like we do now. 

However, right now our channel works because most of our followers are new and probably follow a handful of channels but I can see how, in a near future, this system can soon be unusable because people will be into hundreds if not thousands of channels / groups. I don't expect them to be reasonable and only follow a few channels or groups they really care about, after all, we all been used to follow thousands of account on Twitter / IG / FG for more than a decade.  


How do you think Telegram would (or should) tackle this potential issue?";2021-01-26 13:52:06;"> I don't expect them to be reasonable and only follow a few channels or groups they really care about, after all, we all been used to follow thousands of account on Twitter / IG / FG for more than a decade.  How do you think Telegram would (or should) tackle this potential issue?

I do think that for new accounts, Telegram should setup some initial folders to help keep things organized for new users.  Maybe ""Contacts"", ""Non-Contacts"", ""Groups"", ""Channels"".

And then people can create a custom folder - like ""Channels 1"" - that only includes their high priority channels.

Normally, the user could just check their high priority channels.  

And then if they have extra time, they could check all their channels. I think telegram should allow to dm people in name of your company/business, like you do when you post on a channel, for me seems more professional than answearing with my personal account Focus on increasing the media size shareability currently it's at 1.5gib

Also the search option needs to be more precise - when I am searching for something it takes me to the channels or group I am part of..

Or atleast let the user decide the parameters - search in my groups and channels or search in except for my groups or chats. [deleted] Read here bugs.telegram.org Get the fucking rid of that crappy ""back action"" animation where it is disappears instead of sliding back, android only i think what needs to be improved in telegram is not UX/UI but rather their encryption algorithm > Telegram should setup some initial folders to help keep things organized for new users. Maybe ""Contacts"", ""Non-Contacts"", ""Groups"", ""Channels"".

That sounds like a good idea, something like the Messages - Status - Calls tabs on Whatsapp.

Though I think the things that would make someone coming from Whatsapp to stick with Telegram aren't solvable only by UI/UX improvements - say, importing chats from WA and E2E encryption by default I feel like setting it up by default for all newbies would lead to people being pissed off and some even overwhelmed due to the interface having extra stuff. Right now I think the suggestion to make folders only appears when you have 10+ chats and that seems like a good balance. Become active on the app - get a tip that you should organize your stuff. This exist already in Telegram. Bro, if you're not sure what you're talking about, don't say anything. If you know something that they don't and most of us don't, then go ahead and win those 300.000 dollars they're offering for people that can crack their algorithm that has recently been proved be secure by Italian researchers.

Telegram's phone number visibility;0;l58wgn;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l58wgn/telegrams_phone_number_visibility/;0;"So there's been more than a few posts about contact management /  visibility on Telegram... so I ran a little test.

* I used two telegram accounts, \[A\] and \[B\], each signed up to numbers \[a\] and \[b\].
* Privacy setting for both account is set at maximum
   * Nobody can see your phone number
   * phone number discovery  and profile picture is limited to contacts only.

Basic adding each other to your contacts works as expected.

* From \[A\], I added \[B\] and shared the phone number.
   * \[a\] is now visible for \[B\], as well as profile pic
* From \[B\], I then added \[A\] but this time, did not share the phone number.
   * \[b\] was not visible from \[A\], but  profile pic becomes visible.
   * Trying to add the number \[b\] from \[A\] returns a ""User not yet joined Telegram"" message.

However, this was rather worrisome.

* From \[A\], I deleted \[B\]. My expectation is that A's profile pic, as well as the phone number \[a\] becomes hidden from \[B\]
   * \[a\] remains visible to \[B\] no matter what I do from \[A\]. 
   * \[a\] also remains visible when \[B\] deletes \[A\] from its contact list. I suspect it will only becomes invisible again when \[B\] clears its cached contact. I couldn't test this bit, as both accounts are actively being used by myself and my friend, and we would rather not go through the trouble of entering in all the contacts again.  
   * \[A\]'s profile pic also does not disappear from \[B\], however, this is the result of device cache. It is not visible from \[B\]'s secondary device, and it disappears once cache is cleared.
   * \[A\]'s chat from \[B\]'s device also shows the phone number instead of display name.

So this is a huge flaw - that once you allow someone to have your phone number, there doesn't seem to be a way to take it back, ever.

The only saving grace is that practically speaking, there are only few situations where this would be a problem, as this phone number visibility is tied to the account, not to a phone number. So in theory, with the privacy setting the way I described, you can't have a situation where some random person can have your number through Telegram without first being approved by you.

But for a messenger that leans towards advocating security and privacy, this does not look great. Everyone please take care who you approve your phone number access to.";2021-01-26 10:27:10;

•Do you know if you set any Apps to be able to interrupt DND through your phone's DND Settings? This does solve the noise issue, but it also means I won't have sound notifications in general. Is this just a problem everyone has and is not solvable? I set all the Telegram internal importance settings down.

I do have two apps that can interrupt DND but neither are Telegram. It has to be. We don’t even know each other nor do we probably live anywhere near each other so it’s telegrams fault Have you completely uninstalled/Re-installed Telegram? Or at the very least, cleared Cache and Data storage so it is like a fresh installation?

The good thing about Telegram is all your chats will re-download. So you really wouldnt lose anything. I will give it a go."
Problem with pinned messages;1;l56ozb;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l56ozb/problem_with_pinned_messages/;10;Hey guys, I have a telegram group where I'm the only member, I use it to save important documents (other than saved messages).

Second, are you able to pin new messages? For example, send something to that chat and then check for ""pin"" option for that new message. But those pinned messages also disappeared now and the pin option is no longer available According to one of Telegram devs (levlam, if you wonder), ""There can be millions pinned messages in a chat simultaneously"" Yeah, I solved it, thankyou.😁 May I ask, how? That particular group just became unfunctional, so I transferred all of the files after making another group, and the pinned messages and all work just fine, I don't know what happened with the first one tho, but now everything is running smoothly Did you change any group settings before it ""broke""? Yeah, I did , but I still don't know how it affected the pinned messages though, so I made all the changes beforehand in the other group and then transferred it, and now I'm not gonna make any changes to it, cause of the risk of it being ""broken"" again"
Local group geographic range/distance;0;l56dz0;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l56dz0/local_group_geographic_rangedistance/;0;"Hello everyone.

I'm having a hard time figuring out how exactly local groups work. I made a group and set it's address to a street very close to us (less than 1km) and he couldn't find it. I had to literally set the group's GPS location to our home, and only then he was able to find and join it. However, we can both see people AND groups that are much farther away from us, like 9km.

So, does anyone know anything about fixing this issue? Can't I just insert somehow a generic location (like a whole neighborhood or entire city) so everyone could locate while inside/close to it? The coordinates the app sets as the group location won't allow it, because it takes into account the street and building numbers.

Last question: are all of Telegram’s stickers free, or is there a market to buy some of them in-app? For now, all you see are free. The easiest way to get em is public channels. 

They will move certain sticker packs to the paid tier later though.  That’s a part of their monetisation plan. Have they mentioned which packs are moving, or is that still TBD? My guess, those will be new packs created specifically for that. Their monetisation plan does not involve messing with the regular chat conversations.

[its also available on telegram desktop](https://i.imgur.com/3cjiEdX.png)

i just found out about this, and its awesome. I don't understand this. Does telegram have 'send when online'? I don’t understand the purpose of this feature.

When you send someone a normal message and they’re not online, wouldn’t they receive just the same when they go online again?

Can someone please enlighten me here. I don’t have this on latest ios version OWO I just tried it (desktop) and I dont see it :c It does, 3 dots in schedule message Hold ""send"" button after type a message Maybe so it doesn't ping their phone until they open telegram? Idk This is very useful for some people, though it probably won't be used a lot.

If you send a regular message the person's phone will get a notification.

If you send without sound it won't make a noise, but they will see it as soon as they look at their phone.

Send when online waits until they open the app. Only when they have opened the chat app with, I assume, the intention of chatting, do they see the message. It's a way of sending a message that is not important or only social when you know they probably don't want to be interrupted. So it only comes in when they are already on the phone.

I guess it's for people who want to be considerate and mindful and sending a message that is not at all important when they know the other person might be easily distracted. You, your contact or both probably have your last seen privacy settings too strict. This only works when you can see each other's last seen. You only see it with people whose last seen is visible to you When I got to schedule message it pops up asking for the time but there's no 3-dot menu. On android Turns out that this is enabled only when you have enabled last seen option. I had it disabled so I had no idea about this feature 🤣 only in the mobile app or is it implemented in desktop app as well. And if yes; since which version? Right, this is for when you don't want to notify someone and only want them to receive it when they're online, as opposed to instant or ASAP receipt while they're offline. Thank you for the detailed explanation.

I understand it now. I felt not good about this I saw it as flaw, but glad this only works when you don’t have last seen on in privacy settings I'm using android, it's to the right of where it says ""Schedule message""

EDIT: Per u/roon_shady might not be showing up because you don't have last seen enabled. It's there, and I have no idea. It's available on every app [since December 2019](https://telegram.org/blog/verifiable-apps-and-more) Yeah same! I'm not sure whether this is how it worked since the start, but it sure is a good privacy measure that it doesn't work now. This option also does not appear if the other person has their online status hidden. I just tested with a couple contacts. I have my last connection time public, but K guess that if I turn it off I will not be able to use this feature. Which makes sense. OMG the 3 dots are invisible if you have dark mode on. I have dark mode on, and they're visible for me? I think they might be using a custom theme? Tons of them out there and, with the abundance of elements, wouldn't be surprised if some of them broke visibility. Yes that's exactly it! I have an AMOLED black theme. Totally forgot it wasn't standard."

EDIT: grammar";2021-01-25 18:35:01;"I think it depends on a lot of factors. You might try changing or disabling your username. Do you use a real number or some disposable number app? . Also if you're in a group, they may write you users there. I've heard a lot about that problem, but I've been on Telegram for three years and it's never happened to me (at first I thought I'd be linked to only girls). Usually what I do is use as a username a phone number invented from some other country. That is, that number is itself the username. And finally, you could verify that you have ""people nearby"" disabled on Telegram. Avoid channels of questionable quality, etc. 

I hope it helps. Thanks for your answer.
A couple of time I actually asked the guy texting me how he found me. They said they found my username. I guess it's easy to find somehow.
Is there a way to hide it? 

All other privacy settings are on ""only my contacts"". To hide it? I don't think so (it would be a good idea for them to add that option). But you can still disabled (eliminate it). To delete the username, simply delete the name you used (as if you were editing it) and save your changes."

Why WhatsApp is Losing Millions of Users Over Privacy Changes - Switching to Signal, Telegram, etc.;75;l4fbsu;Telegram;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDxjGPckCbw;21;;2021-01-25 06:53:16;"It would be nice to mention that the reason telegram doesn’t have end2end encryption by default it’s because of the cloud. I've said it before and I'll say it again.
People do not care about privacy when they make a switch. They care about features that are convincing enough. Telegram does everything WhatsApp does and does everything WhatsApp can't. You can't say the same for the other apps. Signal is great, but it's totally impractical. The UI is barebones and has a lot of missing features and it only makes the user install the app and never use it again because guess what? They're comfortable with WhatsApp and people who keep screaming for ""mUh pRiVaCy"", you aren't helping break the monopoly either.
Go use Signal, if your friends are using it and you have something confidential to say but remember this, you're not helping break the monopoly by getting people to install another app just to talk to you.
Telegram is the perfect WhatsApp replacement for the time being and every single person who's crying about 'E2E by default' doesn't see the bigger picture. Once you get people to break the monopoly while not making them feel that they're missing something, you're already winning.

Smash the monopoly, Switch to rest. ““Ironically, in some ways WhatsApp is more privacy-focused than its competitor Telegram. The former applies end-to-end encryption – which prevents the service provider from being able to access user messages – by default to every chat except those between users and large businesses.”

WhatsApp better than telegram in terms of privacy? I dislike that he tells telegram is proprietary. In the difference to Signal, one can install telgram via fdroid. It is even possible to write your own client or bild easy your own bridge to other systems (like [matrix.org](https://matrix.org))

In terms of privacy I love how telegram is independent from a smartphone. All you need is a phonenumber to get a verification code. No app needed. Because our smartphone is so well done to track us, i'd recommend to use it less and less, perhaps get even independent from that brick! I tried to use Signal without the smartphone... It's horrible.... I convinced a lot of friends and family members to move/migrate to tgram, but I still fail to convince them to signal. They have it properly implemented in secret chats. Which is the only place where that makes sense to exist. I really agree to this and adding to privacy concerns, in my opinion are telegrams secret chats 11/10; like seriously. I've already talked about critical stuff online (no children I'm not talking about drugs) and I haven't felt safer than in a telegram secret chat due to the features you have there. Same as with deleting messages for both sides in regular chats, seems like a dumb feature at times but it's actually handy at times and to me, it shows that telegram does care a lot about privacy. Sure you can never be sure that it's really gone from telegrams servers but I trust them on that.

For the biggest part, regular people don't care about privacy that much to give up on features, backups and whatever. For me, these things telegram offers are unreplaceable. 

And lastly, for privacy I wouldn't even trust signal due to things like PRISM. I really think people should rather switch to threema, if they do really care about privacy I would gladly change WhatsApp to Signal, still have Telegram as a second choice for other features WhatsApp or Signal lack: channels, useful bots, better groups and many more. And guess what?, people still using WhatsApp. So is WhatsApp and Telegram then, nothing changed. Better focus on other privacy issues as degoogle my life. Telegram encrypts it’s conversations too, but telegram’s server can see it (if you want the features, that’s the price to pay).

For E2EE, that’s just a click away with “secret chats” (if you are cool with sacrificing some of the features). 

So far that we know, Telegram has never snitched to any governments. Whatsapp is proprietary code. Though they claim it is e2e, nobody knows. > he tells telegram is proprietary.

Literally the apps are open-source and the API is open-source. I really wish people with audiences would fact-check before putting stuff in front of their audience. we are on the same boat 🥺 Yeah I know. I meant that the people like this dude on this video. That they say Telegram has no encryption by default, but they never say the reason why. And the way they say it is like telegram doesn’t give a fuck. I don’t like it. btw has telegram ever disclosed any details like the following case with signal?

https://signal.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/ Yeah and ""No encryption"" makes it sound like the messages are sent in plain text, like SMS. Nope. They've fought against government interventions though so that's a + in my book. You both are right. Some people are just biased to signal that way According to telegram’s FAQ, the encryption keys are broken to pieces and stored at different locations. So if law enforcement does serve a warrant, they gotta cross multiple jurisdictions. Sounds good enough to me. > encryption keys are broken to pieces and stored at different locations

indeed, altough it would sound tome also good enough once telegram allows for some 3rd party their backend servers like signal did

So trying to figure out if Telegram does. You can create a channel where only you or authorized people allowed to post. okay so from what I understand

\- I could invite other people to the group  
\- and I can set it so only I could post messages in that group

and people would then only get notifications from me,  
is what I'm saying correct? Yes. Do not confuse groups and channels.

In channels only admins can post and every post will be sent from channel's name.   
In groups, you can also restrict everyone except admins from posting, but every message will be sent from admins' accounts separately.

Both approaches will solve your problem, but I think creating a channel would be much better"

What's going on?;2021-01-25 05:17:28;"afaik developer is on break. will update the app soon. Telegram X is not a better Telegram. It’s just a way to let developers do the same functionalities but in another way letting them experiment and think outside of the box. If the technology prove to be good, my understanding is that it will trickle down into Telegram. Experimental features are now arriving in vanilla telegram, so is smooooth animation, no need for using telegram X. Telegram x is written in native languages for targeted platform aimed towards app performance and usuability.. Telegram x is one of the smoothest app i used in my android device. No slowness, lag or anything.. But as others say it won't get update as often as main app and misses some features.. Give a try to both app and use the one which you like. I am happy telegram x user... The exact same questions I came to the sub for. It's been months since it was updated. Hoping for a really *good* update to make it worth the wait; because currently, the OG Telegram app (at least on Android) seems miles better than the presently abandoned Telegram X. The only reason I'm using Telegram X is it has better video message (the circle thingy) quality than the original one. Oh and the interface of course but the original app is catching up so yeah Yeah, it's never been updated since 2020. Last Telegram X update was May last year. I hope Telegram LLC hasn't forgotten about that App. [Looks like it's right here. ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thunderdog.challegram&hl=en&gl=US) Still using X, because main app UX still doesn't come close to it. Thank you No, Telegram X is not their experimental client, it's an entirely separate client, the reason that it isn't updated is because there is only one dev and he is kinda busy with life (or something) I thought they had already incorporated most of the features from Telegram X into the normal Telegran client? Where is vanilla telegram? How do you get it? Thanks for your reply. I sure wish they'd make X their focus because who doesn't like an upgraded performance?! If both X and the main app were updated at the same time with the same features, would there still be a reason to pick the main app over X or is it only because the main app already has a lot more users? I got rid of telegram x when I needed the android auto support.

I'll switch back once they support that. Same thing here. As of date, what's the benefit of X over normal? No he's right.

https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x It means the original version of telegram I think the users of Telegram can still chat with users of Telegram X. Their server and all that is the same. funny, one of my friends uses TG X specifically because it doesn't support Android Auto lol You read messages as voice while driving? Or toasts? I turned every notification off on AA. Animations, I really prefer the looks too. Spacing, emoji packs etc. On iOS it was like a beta to rewrite the main app, so it’s basically dead and unchanged since. On Android it’s using a „new“ base but it’s just a week or so behind with getting the new features, because they have to be written a bit different. Can start recording video messages using the rear camera by default On android: You can see the time of the original message when it has been forwarded, You can use custom camera apps for taking photos, there is more customization, it loads way faster for me.  
The main problems right now: channel comments dont work, multi-pins dont work right either You can access channels that are blocked on main Telegram but still work fine on X If you have an older version of Google Play Services, it won't spam notifications asking you to update it. Still informs you in a non-intrusive way.  
Runs better and more efficient on older phones. > [Telegram X for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thunderdog.challegram&hl=en)  was born in the furnaces of a contest for Android developers that our  founder launched two years ago. The winner then used the power of [TDLib](https://telegram.org/blog/tdlib) to create a stunning app with a special focus on **smooth animations**. I see. Thank-you. I thought there was a pre-release beta version somewhere. Yeah that's not being put into question. I think he refers to ""if it gets more users it will get even more users due to its popularity"". Thanks Can you make folders there too? Yoooo, really? I've wanted that for so long. I presume there's no official iOS version that does this, only Telegram X? Interesting thanks, that's a better reason to use it than just cosmetics. Yes, and it also had some features that were later added to regular Telegram, like being able to long-press on a chat to get a pop up preview.

It was their experimental client, but it's not really needed anymore. ""vanilla"" is usually used to describe the original version of something. 

For some people this might be obvious, but for non-native English speakers it might not be (it took me a while to figure out what it meant, and I still don't know if ""vanilla coke"" is just the regular coke or if it's a vanilla-flavored version >:( ) Man Features that the default client got in the last year are not in X. Folders, multiple pinned messages, video calling... I'm only aware of how Telegram X works on Android, not sure if it's the same case for iOS though I just tried to access a restricted channel with X and it didn't work, so I doubt that was true. That's right, but I am trying to say telegram X was a separate client (not developed by the main team). About that long-press feature it would be ideal if it showed always the most recent message instead of showing how the chat looked like when you leave it (maybe a few messages back). Sure, it had some unique features that went to the main app, but those weren't their experiments (it has an entirely different codebase so features can't just be ported, TG devs test stuff in Telegram beta)

TGX is its own app by another developer and although it inspired some features for the main app, it is still meant to be a separate thing I'm new to Telegram, that's why I was asking 😁

Thanks for the info 👍 oh, yeah I agree! Sometimes I want to see what the latest messages are without losing my place."

That's by design. Reinstall Windows Well, this is actually better on WhatsApp. Telegram can implement something like it too. WhatsApp does not send notifications if you are checking your messages on your computer. It waits a couple of minutes before sending a notification to your phone. Nah, sometimes notification comes simultaneously. Actually no. Linux, Mac, Windows. I have tried all of those. I wish there was an option to mute notification If I don't open 5 notification. depends on the last time you used Telegram I am using telegram 64-bit so that might be different Actually yes I was messaging on the laptop and phone was blasting out notification sound on and on. 1 hour ago. Is there any 32 bit versions? xD Did you try it? that means you’re offline, so TG blasts it to all your devices at the same time Official version is 32-bit only. I am using unofficial version. Yeap. No notifications are going to my phone when im actively using telegram on my desktop computer. I mean, if I’m using laptop and telegram is focused, phone notification have to be silenced. No xD. As I know apple dropped 32 bit version support long time ago. So it can’t be. Strange. It’s totally different in my case. Not sure if its related, but i disabled ‘show notifications from all accounts’ under notifications settings. It permanently disable all notification? If so that not a right way I guess. Nope. It only disabled notification from other accounts(if you have multiple accounts added on Telegram). 

You will still receive notifications on your current account. 

Not sure if it works though. Just tossing ideas around. Ah I get it. I’ll try it."

What can I do to stop people from finding me?;2021-01-24 18:50:07;"Unfortunately it is not possible yet. We all wanted this feature from the beginning. For now you can use another number for Telegram. How about the following, will it work?

1. Download the Telegram app but don't install it yet
2. Turn the Airplane mode on
3. Install the Telegram app, open it, set ""Share my number"" to Nobody, disable Contact sync, remove Telegram's access permission to Contacts, remove any synced contacts, close the Telegram app
4. Turn the Airplane mode off, open the Telegram app, it should have  no contacts in, right? I have the same problem! 
We don’t have the right to control who finds us or not, this is frustrating! 
 I already changed all the settings possible like you, and doesn’t solve. 
And is ironic that the new updates is always: add people that you don’t have the number, add people by the location etc. I don’t want to be added by everyone! 
Where’s the privacy on this?  
I’m considering others apps and leave telegram because of this! You don’t. Telegram is the only messaging app you need, so you should be glad when more people join. Make your account safe for work, adjust your privacy settings accordingly, and enjoy Telegram!"

[Q] Please Telegram can you fix your contact handling? It's a silent annoying thing.;14;l3ws5v;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l3ws5v/q_please_telegram_can_you_fix_your_contact/;2;"Telegram has its own contact list, which... well, ok, I guess you need it for non-phone users... But PLEASE allow for all the standard fields of a contact name.

Telegram has been butchering my contact names because Telegram only uses 2 fields instead of the standard prefix, name, second name, suffix... 

If I tell Telegram to sync my contacts, suddenly 5 or 6 contacts get butchered names **on my phone's contact list**! And if I cancel the syncing... Telegram stops using any names inside the chats.

It is specially awful with suffixes, because... it puts them BEFORE the name! What?

**How can I make this get to the people that can fix this?**

Is there a workaround?

Here's some examples:

**Original contact:**

- Prefix: Aunt 

- Name: Mary

**Telegram handling:**

- Name: Aunt

- Surname: Mary

And the worst part, the one that's noticeable in my phone's contacts:

**Original contact:**

- Name: Michael 

- Suffix: (school)

**Telegram handling:**

- Name: (school)

- Surname: Michael";2021-01-24 13:06:45;"There's a features suggestion section with user's votes

I got a notification too from a contact who happened to be on my old phone like years ago, having a Telegram instance on it would cause the trick. At some point his contact was synced to the cloud. May be from am old device you have used and its still stored in the cloud. Go to Settings > privacy and security > contact> delete synced contacts. This will solve your problem hopefully i guess bill has your number in his phone contact list He could be using a recycled number that used to belong to one of the comtacts you saved I had 2 from America that I didn't even know But we do not know one another. That's the strange thing. It would be the same as if you and I were notified that each other joined Telegram. He doesn't. We've never met. You understand that the only way telegram would notify you of this is if you have their phone number in your contacts. That's literally the only way this would happen. I understand that is how it supposed to happen but they isn't the case here. I don't have his contact and he doesn't have mine. Maybe try and contact telegram on twitter?

Telegram, has feature to give group admins on the app better control over how members engage.;195;l3s8p2;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/s3udgqsnh7d61.jpg;29;;2021-01-24 07:16:06;"This app has so much to offer. Sadly marjority of the people I know is using messenger. You know, they call it Slow Mode, you call it ""control over how people engage"", I call it ""making that overly talkative dude in the chat shut up"". Although I wish I could figure out how to enable it for just one person. I noticed there is a cool down time for sending messages in the Durov Chat. I think thats possible on android too Oh god. Most people on the Android subreddit has a hate boner for Telegram... Its insane. You can think about anything comfortable and it probably exists here. Every shortcut, every cool tiny feature. Archive looking annoying and cluttering my chat? I can hide it by long pressing. Video too large? It can compress it. Hard to find links? Well, unlike messenger, Telegram is archiving ALL THE LINKS on separate page! Exactly! Or Signal due to the lack of E2E by default and no E2E Group chats. As someone who has ADHD and sometimes can't finish a thought in a single message/often accidentally hits send... a global setting of this would be devastating to me Yea, ha ha.. I opened a group for my wife and myself And I put a Slow Mode for 10 minutes That's exactly what slow mode is. You can send the first message immediately and then wait for a bit before sending the next one Yes They just repeat fud spread by facebook. Like if people aren't using telegram what are they using instead that's a bastion of open source and privacy besides telegram and signal? Whatsapp and Facebook messenger? Cause I know that until the WhatsApp thing happened it wasn't signal Telegram's cloud security is still very safe Why does ""e2e by default"" matters too much? This is the only argument against Telegram that has been recycled many times. Bring prove(s) that Telegram has leaked or sell users data, then we'll talk.

And why are you too lazy to turn on the secret chat if that matters so much? Lmao. Imagine if we can do that in real life. But I'm much more of a talker compared to my SO, so she would be probably the one using it. Nobody knows. Nobody can access the code, it is not open sourced. First of all, I have been a Telegram user for many years and am not bashing it. I'm simply adding to the OP why users have not easily switched over, and chose Signal over TG. 

Second of all, it is extremely important. Especially if people are leaving WhatsApp for privacy concerns. They're leaving a service that did offer E2E by default (ironically) for an app that is less secure on paper by default (most users don't dive into settings).

No one is hacked untill they are. If Telegram values privacy and safety, then it should be their concern to enable it by default. But that would mean no nice features. 

Imagine if you get a computer and install an AntiVirus, but never scan with it. ""Wow, it's great"" you may say, till you get a virus. Then you discover that you got the virus because you never ran a scan. The AV assumes you should scan it yourself if you want to take advantage of it's secure service. Not a very smart practice, you might think.... Clients are open source. And even if servers were also open source that wouldn't made much difference, as you can't check if the same code is running on those servers But the cloud backup features and multi device options which many finds useful, cannot be implemented with e2e set by default. So Telegram's cloud is neither safe nor unsafe. You cannot determine if it is safe or not. But to some, those features are not worth the risk of potential privacy loss. 

Some people buy ugly locks that are very durable, and others buy pretty locks that are more prone to being easily broken. Which one do you want protecting your valuables when the hammer hits? Well, it hasn't been breached once in 8 years. Pretty locks does not describe Telegram well in my opinion. Pretty ≠ usability. Telegram is very usable compared to Signal and WhatsApp.

Imagine a nuclear bunk as Signal. Very secure, but limited features. Then Telegram as a city mansion, pretty much everything is there. Very near to the city and such. But the only thing lacks is, if nuclear were to hit, Signal user will be safe, but not Telegram user. You does not live in a nuclear bunk do you?

Edit: For those that are paranoid can still live in a nuclear bunk. Nobody has been breached until they are breached. 

You cannot know if your data in the Telegram servers are encrypted or not. Telegram has never been audited so you can only trust Durov, the one “selling” the service.  
There haven’t been conviction based on Telegram data, but this is not a guarantee for the future.  


Telegram staff has access to all your messages (excluding E2E chats). Maybe someone is selling all your data, you will never know. 

It is mostly true that you couldn’t verify if the servers are running the same server code that Telegram could publish but that is not a reason to trust Telegram more. If someone was selling user data, it would be very quickly discovered >Maybe someone is selling all your data, you will never know.

And the point of us caring if our data is sold when there is absolutely no evidence of it is...?

If we never find out someone sold our data, what's the difference? If there are zero consequences and there is no way to tell that you did, sell my data, go right ahead.

What a pointless argument. There are privacy consequences but ""you will never find out"" is a lame way of explaining it. I know right. Speaking about the future which doesn't happen yet is kinda dumb in my opinion. When Telegram does sell users data, that's when we'll act, change to other services or anything."

Or as suggested by other users just use secret chat. > For example I have TG unsynced to my iPad. 

What do you mean by this? Like, you've uninstalled TG from your iPad?  And now someone else downloads it?  If so, then no, they can't read it because AFAIK, you still have to log back into TG once it's reinstalled. The entire system of telegram is cloud based, so there is no way to ""unsync"". The exception is Secret chats that ar E2E encrypted, therefore, not a single other device can see the chats.  


If you mean your iCloud account, you should still have your telegram account locked both with a password and also 2FA. >Can my other half, if he downloads TG on the iPad, see my chats?

no, since they'll need to receive the verification code from either one of the devices you've logged into, or SMS.  but if you setup 2 Step Verification, then they will also need to know the password you set before they can enter your account. idk Hopping in to add that Telegram has nothing to do with iCloud. Everything Telegram related is stored in Telegram’s own server, not linked to iCloud accounts.

So the only way that OP could see their chats on any other device is if they install Telegram and log in to their Telegram account, regardless of which iCloud account the device is using.

So no OP, if you log out/uninstall Telegram from your iPad, and someone else installs is again on that same iPad, it will need an account to log in to be usable. Your messages won’t be seen cause your account won’t be logged in."

If they have your phone number they can still contact you, unless you block them on the app. you only deleted the messages, you didn't delete the chat. so the chat stays, it's just empty. Maybe they saved one of your messages by forwarding them to their saved messages, and clicked on the contact name.

Next time, if you don’t want them to contact you again just block them They saved you as contact you can erase the convo not the contact info. If you block'em it will show you as last seen a month or more ago You have no Username, but everybody have unique ID which is always linked to your account. The moment you texted them you gave them your phone number, which is your identifier in any modern messaging app. Exactly the same as if you sent them an SMS.

It doesn't matter whether you saved their contact or not. If they have your phone number the can text you, be it SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram or anything else. Just block them yo. Block me lol The first thing is very likely, the chat can stick around in its empty format. Also, they could have just added you as a contact during your chat, no need to know your phone number or username. Can confirm that the box stays for the other [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Used a Google voice number or? You can't make an account without a number.

Another thought, you're not in a group together anywhere? you can add anyone as a contact, even without a number or a username. Also, telegram stores recents, so you can usually still find them from search even if you only have the contact name. They probably have you as a contact because you didn’t initiate the conversation, they did. Yup. It says “not seen a long time ago” If you messaged him, and he didn't previously have your phone number stored in his phonebook, then he saw an incoming message from +1... whatever your phone number is. [deleted] [deleted] because you used a client that allowed you to do so. iOS and Android don’t allow for deleting the chat itself unless you are the one who is contacted. I know it's not like a regular SMS, but it's how WhatsApp and Telegram work.

Unless you set a username and gave it to him, he saw your phone number. [deleted] [deleted] i am referring to the initial contact. when you first met your friend, who was the one to initiate a conversation? it was your friend, so that's why you can delete the entire chat even though you wrote to him now. Ok sorry, I got confused with the username vs display name.

Yes, you still have the option to save somebody's contact in Telegram even if you don't have their phone number (hidden) and they haven't set a username.

So he saved you and he can text you again whenever he wants, regardless of you having saved his contact or not.

If you don't want him texting you anymore you'd need to block him."

I listed a ton of obvious pro's but it came down to one girl saying if it was like Slack in that your conversation gets grouped and that she hates that. I said I never used Slack but, said yes. I said it's does it like Instagram, strategically appealing to her girl prejudice ;), where you can reply to a comment, or you can reply on the main thread (post) but it's time stamped & in order of time. So you have the choice. Nope. Not good enough apparently.

&#x200B;

Frustrating. Disheartening. Not a big deal. Just wanted to rant & garnish sympathy i suppose. I just love this platform so much and want everyone using it. Probably taking it to personal as I always seem to fail at convincing people. Having a hard time convincing my whole family to use it which makes this experience worse. I was super polite & sympathetic by saying it sucks signing up for another app but it's worth it in the end, but alas my valid points & charisma was not enough.

Group Me suckz.";2021-01-23 00:05:16;"How can that like slack?  In slack, you can create a different channel in different groups. Slack is more like discord. But telegram is more like whatsapp where you only talk in one group. and channels and groups are separated. Actually, my friends from discord think it is inconvenient to transform to telegram because the group and channel are not that easy to manage together since they are different separated channels and groups. They want that different chat channels can be combined together in one signal group like discord and slack. And they think it is inconvenient to use a voice chat channel on telegram compare with discord. This may get me down voted but ""girl prejudice"" is a cringey thing to say. Also it's not at all like slack in that way, replies in Telegram are always in-line, in Slack you can think of regular messages like new posts and replies like comments on those posts. It's completely different. No problem here I have all my family and friends (groups included) replicated on telegram, now that whatsapp blew it I just left whatsapp, being slowly getting people to use telegram for few years now I never use Group Me, trying to transfer from WhatsApp to Telegram and I switched few of my friends to join me there (I know they still using WhatsApp because of their friends still on there) . The real challenge is to make my family switch and that alone is a uphill battle because they like things they already comfortable with although I explained Tele is a better version of WhatsApp but these things takes time to catch on. Like my mom for example she was like she wasn’t into it and don’t care FB will be collecting her data soon so I just sneaked her phone asked for her to enter her password and downloaded it then tell her message me on there. I’ll do the same with my dad if his phone is able to download it and my grandma. What I did:

Since not many messaging me on WP, I took and write them that I will be available on Telegram.
We had a group with our friends, 9 people, I asked if it is possible to transfer it to Telegram, since it has *these* features which we can't do with you here and it's more private, they agreed.
In other group of friends - 12 of them, I didn't ask them to transfer to Telegram, I just stated that I will be available on Telegram and under ""this"" username after february 8th, they all said ok, most of them already have an account on Telegram, but they don't use it frequently.
The most important thing here is delicacy, you don't push them, but give them a reason to transfer.
On the other hand I downloaded Signal, just to look how many friends are using it, and there were 3-4 of them, so I got rid of it for now.
I deleted Instagram, Facebook(which are all fb's) yesterday.I'm sure they'll be coming, it'll take some time, which I don't mind, it can be unpleasant for them, since it takes some time to get into a new app.

Minority attracts majority, if minorities have a true idea of course.Some people have security concerns, and say that Telegram can not be trusted, it created by a Russian, he works with Putin, who is ""pure evil of this world"" - said by liberal media sites. (Nothing connects him with Russia anymore, even servers and it's racist and dumb to value a company by ethnicity of its creator and make arguments), they say that it is not fully encrypted, let's use Signal, because Elon Musk tweeted about it (and how ironic for me that every news provider published it, it's just a tweet, an ad people).
I deleted WP yesterday after seeing their tweet about prolongation of new privacy policy until 15th May due to ""confusion"".
They already know that they're screwed, they just want people to forget about this through time, and again, fck everyone's asses, it's just a game.
WP had its chance, and it failed, like Parler and many privacy oriented apps did or will, people don't want to acknowledge it. I've got to say I've been pretty lucky, with my family and work group (we used to produce tons of media and news) it was super easy to convince them migrate to telegram from other apps. The file trasnfer and seprate istances based on the devices was already enough. For those friends that I wasn't able to at least convince them to download it I saw a pattern: most of them didn't need a messaging app to work or coordinate with their coworkers or their bosses already made them download 5 other apps... Maybe you needed not to be so polite, learn from this guy https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1341020604934156288?s=21 Don't give up! I also feel disheartened from time to time. Not only from people not joining Telegram, but also from people not caring about things that affect us all (climate, education, tech, privacy, etc). But know that you're being part of a huge change, that things seem to be getting better, and that you're not alone Appealing to her girl prejudice? What is that supposed to mean?

Maybe she gave you a hard no because you didn't describe it well? Just give them a whatsapp theme and ask them to try telegram. Don't forget to tell them that the cloud chats basically act like free cloud storage unlike WhatsApp where you cannot re-download deleted media. Simply I left WhatsApp group (and account) that we use in office. With no explanation! I've created the same group on Telegram and I invite members I offered to buy people drinks to download telegram if they did it by a certain time.

Then I basically deleted WhatsApp, if they didn't download it I just cut them out of my life. They know where to find me. I discovered Telegram last year and have been trying to add more people to it. Whole of my family uses WhatsApp which is retarded, in my opinion. Telegram is way ahead of it in all aspects, especially security and privacy. This month I started asking my family group on WhatsApp to shift to Telegram by enumerating it's great features and advantages over other apps.

Many of my family members and relatives are not some kind of modern and socially aware people, but rather ""backward"", I daresay, in some areas--so it really doesn't matter to them what features they're missing out on by not using Telegram. As expected, only three people joined Telegram -- but they still remain active on only WhatsApp and barely use Telegram. The rest of them don't seem to care in the least.

One of my cousins and all my friends, however, did shift to Telegram and they noticed the difference. When, once upon a time, I tried to make them switch to Discord, one of my relatives replied: ""what are the merits of this?"" So, I told him the advantages and cool features that Discord has and he replied: ""See, on WhatsApp we can text, share photos, videos and files and if needed, we can call others. Who needs those extra features?""

Though it's really not that of a big issue but still, don't they get tired of WhatsApp? In Instant Messaging area, Telegram is by far the best platform available currently -- except for video calling, which I'm convinced it'll soon outperform every app out there in that area too. Still, it remains the best IM app out there. Several months ago I got some friends to try out Telegram. The main complaints were lack of group voice/video calls, lack of channels, lack of reactions. Funny thing is now we have group voice calls but I'm no longer on speaking terms with the friends. Was I lied to when I heard Telegram is shutting down in June? I love telegram, its fun (with its animated stickers) i can customize it completely and it has some really useful features! but one thing thats holding it back for my daily use is the lack of a delivery tick. I have read abt it and understand why its not implementable with the cross platform support but they should have a primary device (chosen by each user) for which you get a delivery tick. Its really imp i know the msg has reached the recipient, ppl do keep their data off when busy and if its urgent we can call/ SMS them.. My parents, who are not tech-savvy in the slightest, randomly joined telegram and so far they are enjoying it. Totally agree. These people aren't video gamers though. I have gamer friends and we all use discord which I think is great for that. Ideally I'd rather use Guilded but never brought it up cause it's really not worth the migration or the extreme convincing it would take. Atleast yet. Just I rather people telegram me than text me as android texting still sorta sucks, even on computer to phone, and when someone reacts to something on iphone it shows up like ""So and so liked 'Hey we should use Telegram' "" on android. That and more is what I've been saying to persuade my family. Argument there is better I guess than getting my none gamer friend group to move from Group Me. Nah you have a fair point. Guess I was just trying to hard to be funny but considering I almost typed facebook and than backspaced and wrote instagram for her I def knew what I was doing. From my experience the females seem to be more active on instagram more than any other social media app. Maybe sexist and cringe for me to point out. Did you convince them or did mostly everyone arrive there on their own? Yeah I may have to do that with my mom anyway. She's not very technical and likes help. She actually was one of the easiet to agree to it somewhat surprisingly. My Dad though is technical enough and would rather people not touch his phone. Yeah all these people are pretty social so I'm sure they have a ton of messaging apps already. Was kinda hoping when I brought it up someone would go ""hey I have that app!"" but nope. Guess it's still sorta newly gained traction. Hahaha; yeah as funny as that would be alot of them are religious (like myself) and have a hard time laughing at crudeness. But thanks for sharing! ☺️ I probably need to send some video that breaks down the pros & cons of the app to convince at this point. But at this point everyone is silent and me continuing to push it to my friends is going to make me look annoying. Not afraid to get pushy with my family though lol. Yes you were. Like future plans were just laid out by the founder. Telegram is continuing forward. What was this rumour about June? I think there should be some bots that can make the telegram groups+channel like a discord one... it would be great. ""The females"" is not a good expression either Convince them past years when whatsapp es still 'ok' Here in the Caribbean it feels like everyone only uses WhatsApp mainly and it will take a lot to convince people to try another app lil Telegram sigh. It sucks you wanna use another app and see so many features WhatsApp was lacking but you’re kinda stuck with it because that’s what everyone uses 😞 What would be a good expression then? Wow, lucky! I'm pretty sure you can come up with an answer of your own if you just think a little bit I'm unable to convince my family  to use Telegram instead. Its fact though females use Instagram way more though. (Sorry?) but it's simply reality. It's not about statistics, it's about generalisation. About 50% of all reddit users are American, therefore the majority in comparison to other nationalities.
 That doesn't mean that: 
1. you should assume everyone is American
2. Most Americans use reddit
Gettit?

Also ffs it's not hard not to use ""the females"" So if I just removed the ""the"" it would have been acceptable? Sorry.  Guess it does sound kinda condescending. Sorry SJW. Thanks for focusing at the real important issues at hands. /s smh. Just use woman/women like every normal person but you make the impression that you're not very normal. 
Please stay away from women in real life too, thanks You read to far into it. I'd have used males if saying ""males use reddit more"".  There's no issue using that word that I can see. Anyway have a good day."

So, most likely, the other person deleted the secret chat you both had (could’ve been on purpose or not, cause when you uninstall the app or log out, all secret chats are cleared) and because of it, it was disabled for you too. When you started a new secret chat in which the other person was included, the chat was created as brand new.

Does bot Clear Data on Deletion?;3;l2q5nz;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l2q5nz/does_bot_clear_data_on_deletion/;0;"TLDR; When I delete a telegram bot by texting Botfather, will all of the messages and content it received be deleted?

Why?

I had developed a bot a few months ago and added it to one of my friends' group to train the bot as an NLP ML(Machine Learning in Natural Language Processing) project. Now I have removed the bot and am planning to delete the bot. 

However, a major thing bothering me is there were many personal things that were there in the bot's messages. Like me and my friends' discussing some pretty publically embarrassing things. So I have got a bit irked about the privacy surrounding it. 

So now that I am planning to text BotFather to delete the bot, I want to know will all the message data and other content received by it be deleted, what's the formality? So that I know better next time if it was a mistake making the bot in the first place.";2021-01-22 18:38:21;

If Telegram had limits then it'd scare some people away, and some would try to reach those limits.

There are limits, but it wouldn't be a nice thing to tell them to people, it'd be a marketing flaw.

I delete my chats if they don't have any useful information once a month. As you have unlimited cloud storage, managing it shouldn’t *really* be an issue, but I’m sure you have a different reason to manage it. I am not saying that Telegram should set limits! I am saying, I'd like to know how much my media is taking up in a particular chat. It does not have to be a flashy text right next to the chat for this to work. 

It can be accessed via settings or a channel or chat.

Facebook actually did it. If you try to export your account, when the file is ready, it tells you how large it is. So, you can tell how much your account takes up.

On Telegram, you have to export your entire damn account, to tell how much it is taking up. I just want to be mindful hoof w much I am using up, that's all. Maybe something is taking up too much and I don't need or will ever need it. In that case, I'll just delete it. I have a sense of pity for those servers if they are not storing useful information.

Doesn't matter the linked chat is public or private, if it's linked people can join via the channel. groups linked to channels are considered public, so maybe your channel and therefore your group's link was added to a list somewhere Telegram bots cannot join groups by itself. Maybe it was a user? How do you know they are bots? How do you know they're Russian? Oh, thought was a welcome bot Btw you can use Shiedly to deal with bots (the non official sometimes spamming type) But group is private so it can't be in any of public lists How ? I haven't found a way to join group via channel's comments unless it is shared by admin or mentioned in channel somewhere I don't think it is added somewhere :

https://core.telegram.org/api/discussion There's a software library which lets you make a bot that looks like a regular user. It logs in with your phone number and messages on your behalf. Actually it's what was used to make ""bots"" before the bot API was created. Let's see I tagged them with welcome messages Their names are Russian .. From one of user's comment they might be users but I asked them and they haven't said anything yet so let's wait and see Thanks. What do you mean by ""linked to a public group"" then? On mobile, tap the channel name at the top to open the channels info (description, photo, etc). Tap the three dots top right, show discussion and join. That simply. I'd have to look up desktop again. it’s very easy to check. 

try entering a private group that isn’t linked vs a private group that is linked. you don’t get the pop up to join the group before allowing you to see the group’s history How u do this? AFAIK the bots must have their names ending in “bot”. Have they? Sorry I meant public channel.. Let me edit it Oh.. Thanks for info. I didn't know that 😅 With ""@${username}"" you can tag anyone in message Doesn't replying to a channel post make the reply show up in the that? Is that what happened? I tried that on a channel the owner wanted to make the group private and I got kicked right away, I believe by an admin bot Replying to comments show up as messages in group but not as user joined group while users(bots) have joined group despite it being private."

***Can Telegram remember your birthday?***   


Sere there are many ways for them to do so. If you've shared your DOB with someone in a chat. Or if one of your contacts who also uses Telegram has your birthday save in their profile for you in their address book, that they granted Telegram access to.   


***Can Telegram know what you enjoy?***   


Yes. They can read your chats. If you share what you enjoy there, they know it.   


***Can Telegram save your pictures?*** 

Absolutely. Same logic. Any picture you share in cloud chats in Telegram they save on their servers.   


***Can Telegram understand your friends and family?***  


If your friends and family, like you use Telegram to communicate with other, Telegram has plenty of information on them to understand them.   


Is it as compelling and comprehensive as Facebook? Certainly not, but it's still incredibly comprehensive! You repeated the same question twice. Please revise your comment. I don't understand. How did I repeat myself? You said ""can telegram know what you enjoy"" as a title twice. Thanks. I changed it."

Not in these days when they elect this fool in murica Sorry. Help me understand what I’m looking at. Some of us are not yet WOKE. [deleted] What about Threema ? It's not free, it's 3$ to buy it but then you don't pay more. Secure and you data isn't shared. It's founded by your payment so no worries from where the money is. r/lostredditors *From a functionality/usability/design standpoint, yes. From a security standpoint, no. However, they are both infinitely better than Facebook Messenger/Whatsapp. features and usability yes, segurity maybe not but i still prefer telegram.

when was the last time you saw a massive users info leaked online?

also +1 for not showing my phone number to every person Marck Zucherburg 2024 Signal = Secure tank

Telegram = Sleek in design and functionality

WhatsApp & Messenger = You're the slave of the product (cause Facebook n stuff) What I meant: Signal offers the best security, Telegram offers the most functions, the other two are worse in every aspect.

Not gonna lie, I do like your interpretation too, lol. r/lostredditors I agree. However, if you were to activate the secret chat and block access to contacts - I think it's then just as secure, isn't it? But it should be noted Telegram is still secure. With secret chat, yes. But then you'd lose functionality, like being able to chat from your computer. Telegram has their justifications, but Signal is able to accomplish true, fully-open sourced E2EE (including the server end) *with* chat across multiple devices. 

Telegram chats are User-to-Server encrypted, then decrypted and stored on the servers (encrypted, but the key *is* also on the servers). Then re-encrypted and sent to the recipient. And the reason for this is to allow for cloud chats. Meaning, unlike Whatsapp or Signal, which require the user to make backups, Telegram actually keeps your messages in the cloud for your convenience. 

But again, my original comment wasn't to insult Telegram. The point I was trying to make was that you should use what works best with your use case. For example, if you value privacy above all else, then Signal is the way to go for most people. However, if you want something that looks and feels like Whatsapp/FB Messenger, but without being mined for data, then Telegram is a good choice for most people.

There is unfortunately no ""one-sized-fits-all"" solution for everyone. But I can say that, for *most* average people, Telegram is a great replacement and already a huge step in the right direction (privacy-wise). My personal view is that, unfortunately, most people are not going to value privacy above *all* else; even though I keep both Signal and Telegram installed, I rarely use Signal because its design is archaic, and its backup features are not user-friendly. In other words, in execution, it's flawed, and most people are going to be turned away.

I'm not a government entity or someone important, but I still care about my personal data being used against me or in a way that is invasive (e.g. targeted advertising based on my chats, which Facebook Messenger does). So Telegram, for me, is a great middle-ground solution. If I were, say, an Edward Snowden type, then Signal would be the way to go. It's still some dubios company. You don't know where the servers are. You only know that some guys have some company ""Headquarters"" in Dubai. They could' ve just rented a hotel room Not in the same way as Signal (end-to-end encryption, algorithms open source) All fair points and a great explanation! It's clear that you don't use Telegram. Otherwise you wouldn't have made such a stupid remark. I do know where servers are: Singapore, Netherlands, Miami. I can also give you the IP and IPv6, if needed. Still secure though. This meme suggests it isn't secure, it is important to show that Telegram is still worthy to use, with sleek design and functionality. Yes I do use it. Be friendly! You're both right. Although I assumed it would be obvious that the Lamborghini is also way more secure than the rickshaws. Well try to do your research better then. Just read the FAQ. That would give you the answers. Don't use anything you don't know the history about. Only by a wee bit though :P"

Did you have 2FA turned on? Realistically, they shouldn't be able to kick you out because you can only terminate active sessions, i.e. log them out, on an old session, I think it has to be at least a day or a week old, specifically to stop hackers from kicking legitimate owners.

So either they've been in there for a while or it's something else. Right now I'd say your best bet is to try and log in and super-quickly deactivate the account.

edit: actually, what kind of message are you seeing when you get 'logged out'? Does it suggest to try later or something? > i clicked on a malicious link, which asked for my number and confirmation code

What confirmation code? Did you get a code sent to your telegram? Go to telegram deactivation page. Enter your phone number and select deactivate account. I had to do it today. Takes a few seconds It just... Umm... It sends me to a front, starting page, i guess. Same stuff on pc exept on pc i have another acc and it sends me there. No 2fa, i didnt know it existed before it happened
I tried to make it quickly but i cant since it is litterally momental And, actually, its stupid to assume that bruteforcing happens on 1 IP. Its mostly done via tor or at least a bunch of mobile VPN's Yeah, the one that shows up when someone tries to log in, but didnt enter it I cant even get past settings page Have you tried the web version? If you don't even make it to the chat list, it sounds like it might just be some sort of bug or smth. Unless they have, I dunno, literal millions of IPs, it is impossible. They'd have 3 tries or something like that per IP with a ton of code variations. And if some account is constantly being attempted to log into, the server would likely just block login attempts for a bit altogether. I wonder if they didn't need you to enter the code... it could have been sent to them. Maybe they cloned your SIM card? Is that possible? Here ye go mate

https://my.telegram.org/auth

Some mobile browsers don’t work. May need a desktop or laptop Maybe will try in few hours, this problem occured past mudnight Number is 5-Digit so 90000 variations. They had like 3 hrs. There are ALOT of tor ips out there. So... Yeah If they need a code they can just view it throught the telegram itself. But they dont need it since they have access to account already. Right now the best option is to end all sessions in my account and set 2fa How does it help tho? No. Even if they changed their IP they would still not be able to log in your account. The account gets limited, not the ip. Not only that, but every time you request a login code it changes. You’re locked out of your account? Someone is using the account linked to your phone number. Bomb that fucker out of there and start a fresh. Otherwise you won’t have an account. Or am I missing something? Yeah but i guess i cant make it fast enough What are you talking about. Just nuke the account and start again It cant be done by sms tho, i have to be logged into the account Damn, thats a big shame i lose the account... Well, what can i do... Did you try ?

Can I prevent people with my phone number from seeing that I'm on Telegram?;47;l1zces;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l1zces/can_i_prevent_people_with_my_phone_number_from/;31;"**TL;DR:** How do I prevent people from seeing that I have a Telegram account, even if they have my phone number? Last Seen & Online is already Nobody.

**Why:** I originally used Telegram only to receive notifications from a couple of sites that used the API, but now that so many people are jumping ship from WhatsApp they're seeing that I'm on Telegram and starting to message me there (I didn't use WhatsApp, I suck at small talk). I do not want people sending me messages on Telegram. My notifications are set to deliver silently (I'm not changing this), so I usually only see the messages when I go looking for them. I have clients that send me Telegram messages, despite being told to email me, because they think I will respond faster on Telegram, and then they complain about customer service because I didn't respond until a day or two later.

I would prefer to not delete Telegram, but if I can't hide the fact that I'm on it that's what I'm probably going to end up doing.";2021-01-21 17:21:23;"Yes, you can set:

* Privacy and Security->Phone Number (Nobody).
* Privacy and Security->Phone number->Who can see my phone number (My contacts), Who can find my phone number (My contacts).

Telegram allows you to delete your contacts from their servers:

* Privacy and Security->Contacts->Delete Synced Contacts and Sync Contacts.

You can prevent users from contacting you if they have your phone number and you don't have their phone number:

* Privacy and Security->Phone Number->Nobody and My Contacts.

Note: this works even if you have the user's number in your address book, but you avoid synchronizing it with telegram servers. * Create a bot that reply 'were sorry, this account is deactivated"" for every incoming personal message.

* create 'folder' of your notifications that you would like to see and drag it to the left.

* create a folder of all the personal chats, every new chat will be added to this folder automatically, so it would be hidden. If you don't have their numbers in your contacts list ,yes you can prevent them in settings **You can't. Not completely. Not by default.** 

At least that's my understanding.  


Yes you can go into your settings and change your privacy settings so that no one can see your number. But that just means that people you're already chatting with can no longer see your phone number, just your username if you have one.

That doesn't change the fact that your contacts will still be able to find you if they have your phone number saved in their address book. 

**By default anybody can find you on Telegram if they have your phone number.**

You can't reduce that pool of people to nobody, only to your contacts,  as in the people saved in YOUR address book. 

That means that if you don't have them saved in your address book, but they have you saved in theirs,  only then will they NOT be able to see that your are on Telegram.   


**But even that's not completely true because** [**Telegram saves your contacts FOREVER**](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/kvekgx/the_way_telegram_collects_and_uses_your_contacts/)**.** 

What do I mean by that? 

I mean that if you delete  *Tom, Dick, & Harry* from your contacts on your phone (your address book / contacts app), Telegram will not update that information on their servers.   


They will not delete *Tom, Dick, & Harry'* s numbers from the data that they have on you,

Suppose you've been on Telegram since 2013. When you signed up you granted Telegram access to your contacts on which *Tom, Dick, & Harry* were saved.  

*Tom, Dick, & Harry* don't use Telegram but Telegram still collected their numbers because  just like WhatsApp and many other messaging apps, when you grant them access to your contacts, they collect ALL your contacts, and therefore all the information you saved about them. Not just names and phone numbers, but email addresses, addresses, birthdays, etc... 

Flash forward to 2018. You delete *Tom, Dick, & Harry* from your contacts app because you haven't been in touch with them in years. Guess what? Telegram does not delete them from the data they have on you, from all the contacts they have associated to you.   


Flash forward again to 2021, *Tom, Dick, & Harry* join Telegram. Guess what? You're gonna get a notification about it! You know why? Because Telegram never deleted their numbers from your Telegram account on their servers.  


**They can't hide from you either!**

Now imagine if *Tom, Dick, & Harry* didn't want you to know that they're on Telegram.

They can't do anything about it either because by default Telegram notifies you every time one of your  contacts joins the app. Even if you deleted them.  


By default anybody can find you on Telegram if they have your phone number.

**The only way  to prevent anyone to know that you're on Telgram by default is for you to sign up with a new number that no one knows, and to NOT SHARE YOUR CONTACTS WITH TELEGRAM.**

If you only use Telegram to get updates from sites you follow, then you don't need to use your real number. You could have easily used a virtual number that no one knows apart from you.  Plenty of apps allow you to buy virtual numbers. Like [Hushed.](https://hushed.com)  


If you are going to do this you need to delete your current Telegram account, and create a new one with a new virtual number. **DO NOT update your current Telegram account with a new number**, because it will have all the data that Telegram already has on you associated with it. 

  
Furthermore, it will notify all your Telegram contacts  that you've updated your number.  So don't. 

Create a new account, with a new number that only you know, follow all the people you follow with your current account, then delete it. 

&#x200B;

**TIPS ON USING A VIRTUAL NUMBER**

If you are just going to *temporarily* buy a virtual number just to sign up to Telegram, that means that it's possible that at any point someone else gets that virtual number, and can use it on Telegram and takeover your account.   


Personally if I just followed public channels like you, it's not something I would care about. Just make a note of all the channels your follow, save the links somewhere, so that if someone takes over your number and uses it for Telegram, you can just re-create a new account, with a new number. 

I would advise [enabling 2FA](https://telegram.org/blog/sessions-and-2-step-verification) too, so that IF someone takes over your Telegram account with your virtual number, they'd have to start from scratch. They won't have any of your data, or your chat history, or your username, because it will be automatically deleted. I have a new phone AND a new phone number. Logged into previous Telegram account and SOMEHOW contacts from my OLD phone are adding me on my NEW number. I did not migrate contact info or any data over to my new device. This means my contact list was uploaded to Telegram servers?

How do I stop this? I got a new number specifically to detach from certain people. Simply use a free google voice number to sign up and don't give that number out. No, because you shouldn’t want to prevent that. Telegram is the only messenger you need. I didn’t know the see phone number setting went that far, I thought it was just who can go into chat contact and see the phone number.
However, in the who can contact me by number my only options are everyone or my contacts. The description below says that if they add my number to their contacts and I have their contact they can see me. Does that only apply to Telegram contacts or to phone contacts too? I already cleared cloud contacts and I don’t have the permissions to access contacts turned on so they shouldn’t see me right? Oh my god this is perfect, thank you so much! >Delete Synced Contacts

Wait, if I choose to Delete Synced Contacts, can this prevent people who already stored my phone number on their telegram contacts see my phone number (if I set none can see my phone number, but before I set it they already stored my phone number on telegram). Does this only apply to Telegram contacts or to my phone contacts? Thanks! This is the most helpful reply yet. It sucks that there isn’t an invisibility setting, I really hope they add that.
I assume if I use the delete account option and the  create a new account with the same number they’ll just re-link everything despite the claim that they delete everything. This has been a source of some frustration for me as well - and I think Telegram needs to update their contact management to allow users to manipulate all the ""invisible"" phone numbers that are saved in the cloud. 

However, there IS an option to clear your contact cache now. It was my understand that when you do this, you clear all numbers that is saved in Telegram. So if you do this, can't you at least prevent people you deleted years ago from showing up again. It might be the cloud sync feature for contacts.
Go to Settings, Privacy and Security, Data Settings (very bottom) there is a tick box for cloud contacts you can turn off and delete cloud contacts. Otherwise if you use the same username it may have linked the old account with the new? You may have to create a completely new Telegram account. From what I have noticed, over the years, all the contacts that I interacted with at some point, can find me on Telegram. Even If I don’t have their number anymore I don’t message people. If a person wants to contact me they should email me or if it’s urgent call me. That’s the main reason I deleted WhatsApp years ago. Some people see that you’re on a messenger app then suddenly feel that they are entitled to your immediate attention whenever they want like it. The status thing on WhatsApp never worked, people were still messaging me and getting mad when I didn’t respond. I think messenger apps, especially ones like Telegram with the notification API thingy, should have some kind of hide my existence button that’s off by default, but there for those who want it. If you don't sync your phone contacts on Telegram, only the users you have chatted with are your contacts (you can revoke this by entering che chat options). Please read [this](https://telegram.org/blog/scheduled-reminders-themes#redesigned-message-options). Yes, the answer of your question is related to contacts on telegram server. Yes, if you setup telegram as I described in the previous message. And how does one do that? just ask, if I delete synced contacts, will people who already have my phone number on their contact list still able to see my phone number? I just did few tests yesterday with my friends. We both set who can see my phone number to none, but since we both have each other's phone number in our address book, and we both added each other a long time ago before we set it to ""none can see my phone number"". 

I found it is only possible that if I delete him on my telegram as a contact, then I cannot see his phone number anymore, but he can still see mine. For preventing him from seeing my phone number, I need to ask him to delete me as his contact, which is sooo chaotic. But at least these tests show that telegram can delete my phone number from other's contact.  I haven't tried delete synced contacts yet, but can that delete my phone number from other's contact lists? This should be disabled by default... Honestly, that's fucked up. The downside is I had my contacts synced when I first installed the app. I have since removed the permissions to my contacts app, I have disabled cloud sync and cleared cloud sync. I no longer see any contacts in my Telegram address book, only the request to allow access to contacts. Based on other posts and the settings I could find it seems like all I can do, now I just hope that it’s enough to hide me. I haven’t received any new messages, but I’m not going to say that out loud. well, unfortunately, I tested with my virtual number account. After I delete synced contacts on my virtual number account, my account can still see my virtual number account's phone number.

Seems the only way to delete my phone number from someone else's contacts list is that they delete me from their side.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

I did more tests. If my understanding is correct, there are two contacts list stored on the telegram server link to your account.

One is the contact list from your phone, which is typed by you on the phone. Another one is the contact list on your telegram, which includes the contacts you added on telegram + the contact you synced from your phone contacts.

If you delete synced contacts, the contacts you added on telegram will be deleted automatically and all of them cannot see your phone number anymore even they stored it before.

However, if they added you to their contacts list on their phone, unless they delete you from their contacts list on their side, they can still see your phone number.

This what I tested. If I did something wrong, please let me know. 

I think this kind of ""bug"" is a thread of security. If I am a spammer or let's say Iran government, I can add every random number on my phone contact list and then sync it to the telegram server, then if I meet them on telegram, I will be able to see their phone number. 

If I did something wrong that there is a correct to hide my phone number even from people who already synced my phone number from their phone contact list to telegram, please tell me. Settings>Privacy and Security > Contacts > Delete Synced Contacts. Please.

1. Delete all your contacts from telegram server: Privacy and Security->Contacts->Delete Synced Contacts and Sync Contacts.
2. Block telegram access to your contacts on phone. Thanks! Yeah, I used my virtual number account to do these tests. Let's say if I have two accounts A and B. A deleted synced contacts and hide number from nobody.

But if B \*already\* stored it on B's phone contact list and B also synced the contacts number to B's server. Then A cannot delete B's contact.

If B only stored A's phone number on telegram's contact but doesn't' store that on B's phone contact list, then yes B won't be able to see A's phone number anymore.

Or If B also deletes B's synced contacts, then yes, B won't be able to see A's phone number anymore, even after deleting it B synced it again.

The problem seems that turn off "" Sync Contacts "" can prevent others add you to their contact through their phone contact. However, it can't stop someone who already stored your phone number. >The problem seems that turn off "" Sync Contacts "" can prevent others add you to their contact through their phone contact. However, it can't stop someone who already stored your phone number.

Once an user knows your phone number there is not any way in order to delete it on his device, fortunately. However, you can avoid that that user can contact you via phone number. Yeah, the bad thing is if they know my phone number before, and they also store it on telegram before, and they also had my telegram account on telegram before, then they will also know my telegram account (username, telegram name, icon, etc.). I think telegram can do something by deleting my infromation on other's telegram contacts list on server to prevent this thing, this is possible because I tested it if I can delete other's infromation on my contact list (on telegram server), then telegram definity can do it."

This is a sincere question, though. That would be awesome Guys mine was just an idea, I'm sure the Telegram team would know how to implement it in the best way as possible yeah i agree, today we can improvise that by using folders but thats it Why telegram just don't make sub-chats like in imessage? Tap and you look at a thread only 🤷‍♂️ I feel like that's probably coming with new people joining. Cause they'll likely have more and more corporate users, people who setup their workflow on Telegram. In that case sub-chats would be super useful and it'd make sense to cater to them You can use channel with enabled post comments. And there is also an option to include chat with channel. So you'll have channel chat and chat under each post. you can use folders for grouping chats You can request a feature [here](https://bugs.telegram.org/). New supergroups show the number of replies to a message and you can view them as a standalone thread Sort of ahahah it's market competition.  all platforms have their different solutions and features, but I think telegram has better groundwork.  who cares if it's ""like discord"".  Telegram has plenty of differences that make it better than discord, especially with one-on-one chats, for example, clear history.  Which discord lacks.

maybe only allow one sub-chat at first to see how it goes, so it doesn't become ridiculously disjointed like discord servers with 30 different sub-chats Folders could be better too I wrote that and thought that chat can be very threaded. Maybe that will be good idea to show threads of a chat? Like in thunderbird? They did. You can view replies to a message by tapping on it, be it in a private, public or supergroup. Works both on mobile and desktop. In general I just want to say that it will be great to view chat threads in more viewable/understandable format then it is now That's the point! ❤️ It's not what i meant, i don't want a folder, i want an unique chat with multiple sub-chats
Folders doesn't work as I'd like too Requesting is not available for everyone. Omg 😂 but so it becomes a mess 😂 I hate that I can't write a single full word as name of the folder. ToO lOnG! I can see replays for me those I didn't read yet, yes. I can jump to a message that was replayed by current message, yes. Hm, but how to view messages those are replies to a current message? Or maybe I got you wrong? Yes, at the moment."

Stickers privacy;4;l1dygl;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l1dygl/stickers_privacy/;23;"Intro: Group of friends jumping from WA to Telegram as main platform, the usual. 

&#x200B;

I feel uneasy about the way stickers are handled in Telegram so I have a few questions. It seems to me that the sticker packs don't have dedicated space on a device (storage) but are stored on a server when you make one? We have lots of NSFW private stickers and none of us would like it if it was stored as a public pack to be discovered by others by a search engine. Am I missing something? Can I use a third-party app to store my stickers on a device rather than a public searchable server? 

My understanding is no at the moment but I would appreciate anyone's insight on this matter.";2021-01-20 20:34:21;"No, stickers are public, yet untraceable. I don't believe there is a way to access all Telegram stickers. But, if there were one, the search criteria would be the pack's name.

So, if you really want to be sure that no one else but your friends access your stickers, you just have to name the pack a long string of random letters. I understand that you want a sticker pack that is completely locally stored and private but here are some reasons why it is not like that. These reasons do not change the fact that yes, there is option for that.

Sticker packs are meant to be easily sharable. Stickers are just photos or short video files, at least practically. They are ""stickers"" because of how easily you can share them. They are meant to be sharable.

Locally stored stickers, I am not qualified in this topic, most probably, cannot be distributed amongst all of your connected devices. Kinda like secret chats. And that defeats the purpose of Telegram's core functionality.

Again, I am not qualified in the topic but, they are kinda like YouTube private videos. Yes, there is a way to reach them but they are practically unreachable.

Nevertheless, these are not reasons that keeps you away from what you want. I do too, even though will probably not use it, think that there should be option to store stickers in your devices, without sharing them to the cloud. I just came here to say that: I'm with you.

Telegram's implementation leaves a lot to be desired. Why can't I just add a sticker to favorites, why does it have to be the whole pack??
Don't get me wrong WA way has a long way to go (I'd love to be able to classify in folders my saved stickers) but I do think it's better than Telegram's.

Edit: well it does have a favorites system in place, I'm just dumb, who would've thought Signal boasts that their stickers are private, so maybe they have the feature you're looking for? How do you search stickers by name? Yeah, I get that. I just feel uncomfortable making stickers that should be private a discoverable public pack. No amount of complex hiding is going to make me feel differently. It seems like an unnecessary invasion of privacy, or lack thereof. 

Unless there's a good (especially security) reason  stickers are being handled this way, I'm heavily opposed  the way things currently stand. But you can... Clicking next to the sticker will give you the option to add it to favorites. You can also long press on the sticker and click on the star... Yeah, WA is currently superior with stickers in my opinion even though they're far off from ideal.

I just don't get it... Telegram makes you publicize every sticker that you make in order for you to use it. Thanks, I'll check it out, I'm actually using Signal for SMS exclusively. I do like Telegram more and it'd be perfect if it handled stickers a bit more openly. There are websites and internal Telegram groups and bots for that.

But, again, I doubt they can access all stickers.  
They most likely just return you results based on what's publically available. Search in stickers menu I guess. Stickers are supposed to be sharable by design... even if you used images, someone could share them. You just want a sticker pack that nobody else can use unless they're in your group? I'm not seeing the use case here, where's the privacy issue? They do that to facilitate sharing.  
If they needed an authorization or something, the stickers wouldn't be usable by a large number of people and whoever has to approve sharing the stickers would hate themself for having ""wasted"" time making them in the first place (just imagine getting 1000+ daily requests for every new published sticker pack). Oh ok then, I could've sworn it wasn't there when I looked for it everywhere, maybe I missed it, thank you! Shareable amongst closed group of friends between each other, not the possibility of putting it for the whole world on display. Is it unreasonable to ask that the sticker packs be given public/private statuses? 

Private images made into sticker packs uploaded on a public searchable engine on a messaging platform advocating for privacy.

I like Telegram, don't get me wrong, but stickers are a big part of our communication and they're anything but private. I understand the reasoning behind it, I'm all for it, except we can't make our own private stickers without sharing it with the whole world.

I'm spitballing here, but couldn't they make certain sticker packs only accessible via a key, authorisation of some kind? Or a restriction of using a certain sticker pack in one chat group exclusively? Or just give us an option of making, implementing and storing them on our own... I still have absolutely no clue why this is such a big deal. Sticker packs are not public unless someone shares the link. If the idea of someone else adding them is a problem, just keep the stickers among yourselves.

It's like uploading something to an image hosting site and getting mad when someone leaks the link to it and now it's public. Like... okay? Why in the world do you care? Are they nudes or something? Are you putting your SSNs in sticker form?

I have tons of NSFW stickers and the vast majority aren't mine. Nobody cares. Currently stickers are ""attached"" to the account, rather than a group (like bots, for instance).  
So it's more likely that they could implement ""authorization stickers"", instead of group-exclusive stickers.  
Otherwise, they'd need to do a complete sticker overhaul for it to work.    

But it's a valid suggestion nonetheless. You're obviously not getting it.

 If you, for example, upload an image to a hosting site and make it private it can ONLY be accessed via a link making it ""private"", but here it's public nonetheless and, even though extremely hard if you make it out to be, searchable. Meaning they can be found without anyone's help (link) and I have a problem with THAT.

The way it's made is ultimately inferior because it limits your option to choose and directly control stickers forcing you to conform to a system that's not private at all, where it could easily be improved upon. And if someone posts the link to your private image somewhere, it will also become searchable. Just like with sticker packs. That's why I made the analogy in the first place.

I still don't understand *why* you need these super secret locked down sticker packs. Besides some vague invocation of ""privacy"". I'm not getting it because you're not explaining it. And you're pointing out that nothing is truly private on the internet but that's not what this is about. Nor do I talk about the true encryption/protection of any platform. 

What if no one posts the link to a private image? It stays private. It's about trust and protection. Our privacy would be in OUR hands as far as we can affect it given the circumstances. We decide who we share it with.

It wouldn't be super secret, it would be NOT DISCOVERABLE by a search engine to the public which is not unreasonable by any means. I'm not comfortable sharing certain images without some sort of privacy protection if I choose so.

If you're not getting where I'm coming from our opinions and values probably greatly differ on this matter which is fine, we just think and live differently. Again, sticker packs operate exactly the same. You are describing the same thing. There is no search engine that knows about all sticker packs ever made."

It appears (or at least, I suspect) that the people I get a notification from (I mean, the notification is from Telegram but you know what I mean) are people that may/might have my phone number in their contact list, if that makes sense. Because, I checked my SIM card contacts list by importing it in my iPhone and it’s empty, so i’m sure that there is no « hidden informations » coming from me/my phone/my telegram account that could explain all of this. 
Furthermore, my Telegram account has never been used on any other phone that did not contain the very same SIM card.

Telegram vs Slack for my coffee shop?;52;l1bml0;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l1bml0/telegram_vs_slack_for_my_coffee_shop/;45;"Hey all!

I keep searching for ""telegram and teams"" or ""telegram and business"" but can't find a good answer, so I'll post here!

I own a coffee shop with a dozen employees. Right now we're using Group Me for team communication. It works good enough but I'm looking for something a little more robust. 

Here's what I'd like:

* Basic chat - The baristas are hilarious and love to mess around with each other which is good for team building. They also will get chats going about ideas for new drinks. The chat room makes for great creativity.
* Recipe book - Right now someone will post the recipe for a drink. A month later that recipe is so buried that you can't find it. I'd like a way to have all of the recipes easily discoverable. 
* Training videos - I post a lot of videos (how to make pour over coffees, how to clean the espresso machine, etc). I'd like those videos easier to find. 

I started putting together a Slack channel to do all of this. One channel for each category so it would be easy to find what you need on the fly (recipes would be found together, etc) It would work well but it's not nearly as user friendly or ""fun"" as Telegram. 

What's the best way (is there a way) to use Telegram this way?

Also open to other ideas.

Thanks!";2021-01-20 18:42:03;"Telegram works great for being able to find links, images, and media that has been posted in a channel. I use slack for work and it doesn't have the best way to filter these out or go to a separate tab in the chat to find them. I'd say go for telegram over slack. Create channel for recipe, video. And  group for chats. Many people doesn't take complete advantage of hashtags.

1. Telegram polls are amazing and stickers too, use that, it will more interesting.
2. Do this for recipe problem.. when someone adds a recipe ask them to include #recipe hashtag in the message itself. You just need to click the hashtag or search #recipe and all messages tagged with #recipe will show up in a list.
3. Same method you can use for training videos just add #video #trainingvideo hashtags in the caption of the Video. Telegram actually provides separate tabs for media (audio, Videos, Pics , docs) History of pinned massages in Telegram is the way to go for your needs Telegram allows you to search messages in the group chat so you just need to remind your employees to name the file correctly and clearly to find it immediately (I recommend the use of an hashtag, like #Recipe, for instance).

Another way to find a file is to go in the group's info. You will then find everything that was sent to the group divided into Media, Files, Links, Music, Voice, Gifs.  
You can then scroll down to find what you're looking for or use the search icon here as well.

Telegram also allows you to pin messages.  
It's a feature that is commonly used to highlight last-minute announcements but you could use it to (also) pin the training videos.  
You can pin as many messages (or files) as you like. For a small group of people one telegram chat could work, but for any more than a handful it will probably get a bit messy. Keeping separate telegram chats for things with the same set of people will probably get a bit hard to manage. To be able to keep it structured and manage employees coming and going you probably want to go with slack. At work we use slack for a lot of garbage as well, so keeping it ""fun"" should not be an issue just based on the tool you choose. Just wanna chime in and say because you're posting in this sub there will likely be biased responses. link a private channel to a group, then post the recipes to the channel. it’ll appear in both the channel and the group, allowing you to discuss the recipe in the group but allowing it to be easily viewed from the channel Telegram doesn't have threads. I can't imagine the work I currently do without threads that Slack has. I work with both, and finding old media is easier on Telegram. And the clients are much faster both on Android and Desktop.

I recommend that you create separate channels for instructional videos, schedule coordination and so on. Makes it much easier to manage.

As for the recipes you might want to invest some time and money and host your own recipe management software. There are many, but i haven't used them. So here a recent post on the self-hosted subreddit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/eo2z2l/self_hosted_recipe_management_tool/

PS: Don't forget that you need to pay the enterprise rates for slack if you want the archiving functionality or access very old messages efficiently. Although i am not sure your organization is complex enough to need to use these features. For recipes, you can pin them in the chat easily. Telegram is great for things like these.

As for videos, you can check the videos tab and it lists all the videos sent in a group. I think discord works best.

But then again, for professional sake, go with Telegram since you can send HD videos and large files. i post my weekly schedules in a family group, and the way i manage them is with hashtags. they're clickable and nicely sorted afterwards! Man, I wanna work in a coffee shop in Austria or swiss. 

🥺 Telegram w/pinned messages and group chat plus Recipe Keeper and synchronized recipes.
Recipe Keeper costs a bit per sync, but it's definitely worth it! (you need to sync only with the person responsible for the recipes, if it's you no additional buy necessary. Get the free version and check it out. The functionality of importing recipes from websites makes me smile every day). It would look like this:
[Grilled Potato Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette ](https://recipekeeperonline.com/recipe/9iDtS6oqWk-ZOCnNw0e7gA)

Pin the links to the recipes in the Keeper to your telegram group.
Easy, convenient, efficient. 


Edit: clarification on Recipe Keeper Use #tags to find your messages. Create a channel with comments, so it would look like feed. Add private chats for different groups to follow everything. Telegram would be fine for this (someone else mentioned #recipe for example), but personally I think I'd be inclined to use Discord. They'd all suit. If I were to choose telegram i would pin all the recipes, and send the videos to the chat normay. Other option would be discord, and basically creating 3 channels: recipes, videos, and general chat. I would like to recommend Lark for this but I'm not sure how privacy focused you are, because app certainly isn't, but it's so damn good. You can run a 2000 people company from there all for free. It has bots for HR, appraisal, docs, sheets, groups, zoom level meetings (free, no time limit)
If you need privacy then maybe Telegram is a better option, although I think it works better as a private chat app rather than a team app By using hashtags, your needs can be fully satisfied > *  Recipe book - Right now someone will post the recipe for a drink. A month later that recipe is so buried that you can't find it. I'd like a way to have all of the recipes easily discoverable.
* Training videos - I post a lot of videos (how to make pour over coffees, how to clean the espresso machine, etc). I'd like those videos easier to find.

Imo it's a recipe for chaos (hah!) if you use a chat service for this, you need a thread-service, Slack is 100% better, but you can also use other tools like Trello, Notion, or even Codeck.io You can, for simplicity, pin a single message with links [click on the space near the message (**on the same row**) and click on 'copy link'] for the other messages, videos, pictures, and other files.

People don't use tags enough, so I'd avoid using them, but that's just me.

Good Luck! I use both, but telegram for more private stuff, that's why I'd suggest slack. Idk it just seems better organized there, having channels and stuff. But, they also have stuff like file size limit which can get annoying if you don't want to pay for it so.. it's a tough decision, it depends on how much talk you have on there I'd say. If there's a lot, I'd suggest slack because of it being more structured and you could lose important things on telegram, if there's not much and you think everybody will see everything that's important, use telegram Since no one else mentioned it, you might as well give free Microsoft Teams a try as well and see what you think. I'll be the first to admit Teams probably won't be as fun to use as Telegram or Slack, but it you can create dedicated teams and channels within teams like Slack, store recipes, find anything quickly using search plus the chat function has (limited) emoji and stickers. You should try Microsoft teams, it has less limitations than slack. Having used both, I much prefer Slack over Telegram for business stuff. Slack offers dedicated channels, so you can do something like a recipe channel and it's only for recipes
 
Also you can create channels that have only *certain* people in it, which is super useful for things like having a bosses chat etc
 
It also doesn't have to be tied in with a phone number, so if you have an employee who doesn't have a cellphone plan they can still use it Slack is an excellent tool and I would definitely recommend it as part of an organisation. However in its free version you can only access up to 10 000 messages in the history. And from what I remember the paid version is about 6€/user. You're on the Telegram subreddit, what kind of replies were you expecting? well u can make different groups and put it on a folder ""work"" like create a group for recipes, fun, training etc and then put all it on a folder I also think this is a good solution. You can also link the channel to the group chat to tie it all up together Or better yet, have one channel, and when someone has a recipe, tag it with #recipe. I use telegram for work and think it's fine, but I will say that having the same app for work and personal life is sometimes not ideal. What would make it OK is if you could schedule notifications. I just want to turn off work notifications  when I'm not working. I know I don't have to reply when someone writes me over the weekend or in the evening, but just seeing it stops me from being disconnected from work, which I think is important.

That being said, I've used slack and telegram for work and I think that for OP's use case Telegram would be absolutely fine. What OP is looking for sounds pretty simple. Slack has integrations with things like google docs, github, etc. But what OP is looking for is just a place to chat and share content. Telegram is perfect for that. Yup. As someone who uses both Telegram and Slack (the latter for work), I would say Slack is better for OP's use case. I guess it is possible future feature. While we can upgrade our groups to supergroups I think they will make workgroups where we will have threads, etc. > the clients are much faster both on Android and Desktop

This is so true. For my old job I had to use Slack. Had a secondary laptop that I used sometimes. Its specs weren't even that bad, but Slack would be incredibly slow. Both the dedicated app and the web version. Telegram worked absolutely fine though. Answers to her/his questions. Which are being provided. I don't really see disingenuous answers here. Here is the blog post regarding folders: https://telegram.org/blog/folders

I use them myself. I have personal chats, as well as folders per organisation I work with. I have ""friends"", ""family"", ""organisation 1"", ""organisation 2"".

It's a good way to separate personal and work chats. Why exactly? I've also used slack and what OP is looking for sounds pretty basic. In what ways do you think Slack would work better? Well, for one, I prefer to keep my work communication separate from my personal communication. I don't want to accidentally share something to work chat, for example.

Also, Slack, from a workplace perspective, does ""Rooms"" (Channels) better. It's more professional, while still being relatively casual and easy to use. I understand that I'm in the Telegram subreddit, but I'm not gonna ignore the fact that Slack works better for OP's use case. - Keeping personal and professional separate is a personal preference. It's fair enough, but OP has said nothing about this. I also think it's manageable with folders.
- how are channels in slack better? I feel like they're pretty much the same.
- OP wants something ""fun"", so I don't think your argument about professionalism is valid I believe Rooms in Slack are different to channels in Telegram, Rooms are like in-groups chats the same as Discord. Highly better organized than a single big group. Slack is fun enough. It has bots, add-ons, compatibility with things like Google Calendar, Giphy support, etc. The point is to get work done. This is correct and a big differentiator. I feel as though many people commenting this post are trying to jerryrig Telegram into working for OP's use case. At the end of the day he's trying to run a business and is managing employees. It's not a fun time group chat."
Proof of formal correctness of MTProto 2.0: cloud chat and e2e chat;47;l1blkw;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l1blkw/proof_of_formal_correctness_of_mtproto_20_cloud/;18;Researchers proved the [formal correctness of MTProto 2.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03141v1.pdf). Now, telegram has both formally verified protocol and [reproducible builds](https://core.telegram.org/reproducible-builds).;2021-01-20 18:40:42;"Sounds like good news all around. Wonder why it's Italian researchers? Is Telegram that popular in Italy/Europe? Great! Now if we could have e2e group chats that'd be perfect. MTProto 2.0 was rolled out in 2017...

Telegram said ""major clients support MTProto 2.0 from version 4.6""

Now it's good that it's verified to be somewhat safe, but it's nothing new. It's from 2012. Wonder if anything has changed. Telegram is a secure platform, like Facebook. For transferring data, Telegram uses MTProto2, Facebook uses SSL. Both are secure.

But like Facebook there's little to no privacy, since all the conversations that are not e2e encrypted are accessible by Telegram itself. And nobody uses e2e chats regularly, because they're very crippled by design.

Hence whenever you don't use secret chats, it's pretty much like using Facebook, since Telegram stores all the data server side and we don't know whether today or tomorrow it will read it or process it.

So, great that they proofed that MTProto2 is sound according to ProVerif, the real elephant in the room though is that Telegram has a very huge problem with data privacy.

EDIT: it would be nice if you could elaborate instead of just downvoting. Telegram's value is undeniable, and so are its pitfalls. And until those are fixed I don't see how it could be recommended in place of WhatsApp when in privacy aspects it's even worse. Yes. It's extremely popular in Italy. I 🇮🇹 everyone is on WhatsApp, a lot of youths are also on Telegram, but don't use it much. Right. You can follow [this](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/871) and create a feature request [here](https://bugs.telegram.org/). Now it is formally verified. This is an important proof. It's one and a half month old 😅 Is it really? It feels to me that it is the opposite. I'm trying to switch to telegram complitely and the Italian friends are the ones that are still on WhatsApp. Most of the people I know that live in Italy are only WhatsApp users.
I might be unlucky also. Thanks for the links, but the first link leads to a 6 year old issue that hasn't been updated in 5 years and the feature request thingy in link 2 doesn't have e2e groups as a request (if I didn't miss it).

The request to get e2e group chats is as old as telegram but nothing has happened in at least 6 years. Sadly I won't hold my breath that they'll still add it. I was talking about the first link from OP. It's a review of the protocol from 2012. Says it right in the pdf.

Maybe the other link is not? Ed: the 2nd link for reproducible builds was posted dec 2019.

So what's a month and a half old?

Ed2: hey, I was wrong. Nice. Not the first time, won't be the last. Well, since 2016 when I joined, the biggest spammers were always Italian. I made a porn group and they came in droves to try to destroy it through spam. In the end, when I kicked the hundreds of madmen and madwomen, the group was chiefly Italian now because some came just for the porn, and I had to establish strict language rules and even made some Italians moderators in order for them to keep things under control.

I have a biggish dog pictures channel, English is the rule, and for some reason like 20% of the members are Italian. Stats: https://i.imgur.com/jLByEfz.png

Here's another channel, bigger than mine, and it's 90% just text in English, whole paragraphs and jokes. You'd be right to assume it's chiefly English visitors. https://i.imgur.com/epLBqYc.jpg

But there are over 500 million Spanish speakers in the world, and Italian is ~12% of that number at 63m, Russian is 166m. How come they're the same or even bigger % in every stat I've seen? My only conclusion is that Italy is overrepresented. I've seen this phenomenon in other channels as well, as I was in a channel creator group (where many were Italian).

In Venezuela, most of the telegram users are concentrated in the western state of Zulia. Maybe it's the same in Italy and most people who use it are in some region you're not close to. This says a lot about their interest in the user data. Telegram is behaving like Facebook 100% and the users pretend to not see. Until one day they'll see and it will be very painful."

Maybe your internet extremely fast. Or maybe you aren’t giving time for the server to take action of deletion Could there be a situation where authorities can request telegram to provide data on an individual, since all cloud chats are server side encrypted.

Blocking Telegram in Russia is the process of restricting access to Telegram messenger on the territory of the Russian Federation. The technical process of this restriction began on April 16, 2018. The blocking led to interruptions in the operation of many third-party services, but practically did not affect the availability of Telegram in Russia. It was officially unblocked on 19 June, 2020.

Telegram iOS doesn't have analytics? Or maybe it's under a different package name.

It does use google stuff though it seems:

https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS/search?p=1&q=google Because Telegram cares more about usability than privacy, and will sacrifice privacy if it means adding new flashy features. Omg, thanks for this, telegram.org has google txt records also. maybe it uses google's SDK, so it comes with analytics also, not terrible, but also not ideal You can't turn it off because it doesn't exist. Your sources are wrong Right. On android, via f-droid, you can find [FOSS](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.telegram.messenger/) version without any tracker. https://ibb.co/C8hXLnH

* location opener.

No need to change any meaning! Just give it a little ""EDIT: Turns out Telegram does use Google and Microsoft analytics"", done! Yeah, You are wrong.

Why does Telegram make development contests?;2;l17p6y;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l17p6y/why_does_telegram_make_development_contests/;7;"I never understood the reason why some features are ""outsourced"" in the form of contests. An example of this is the ongoing Animation Contest for iOS.

Why don't they simply develop such features in-house? I mean, I _think_ there is a dedicated team/person behind each Telegram app.

Is it really cheaper offering a 50'000$ bounty instead of paying in-house developers?";2021-01-20 14:50:57;"Because number of third-party designers/artists is incredbly larger than the number of actual Telegram devs. Contests are usually done when the ""employer"" wants more choices.  
Sure, the logo (for example) that the artist you hired is cool, but what would other artists have come up with?  

Instead of hiring more artists and giving them their regular pay, they decide to hold a contest so that they can see multiple artists' job for free and pay only one of them.  

Of course, the winner gets paid a lot of money, but the ""employer"" gets more choices and gets results in a much shorter time than it'd have taken them, had they hired a small number of people.

Also, contests are really good to keep people engaged and interested in your product.

So it's a win-win situation. More variety and allows users to decide what features are best, I get it, however this makes me wonder for example how messy the resulting source code must be.

I've read complaints about the poor readability of Telegram for Android source. I don't know if it's a direct cause of their development approach based on contests, though. And the results are really diverse and makes the app evolve like most of the community wanted to. It's like the entire world collaborating. There's plenty of winners in Telegram contests. Never just one. Well, you can read Telegram apps' source code on GitHub and make decision yourself. AFAIK there are 3 main devs for Android app currently (and one for Telegram X)"

Are you okay with the unrestricted access to porn and other content that Telegram gives them?

If you prefer Signal, do you find it restrictive that you can't share your live location with each other?

(I'm obviously referring to parents/guardians who are _not_ accepting fb's terms.)

My little niece just got her own phone, and has installed Whatsapp. I'll be deleting my WA account soon, so we won't be able to communicate with each other, since there's no way I'd introduce her to Telegram. It's not that big of a deal since I'm not her guardian - but if I were, we'd be forced to use Signal, I guess??

Info: A lot of people are informing me that I found porn by searching for it. It's actually just sitting right there in the list of public groups. Some of them have obvious names, while another has a generic name. Then in between those, a few 3-member groups with nothing going on. No searching of any kind required.

Also, my assumption is that you'll only be shown those groups when you're physically near the members or admin? So of course some people won't find the same groups just by looking at the public groups list.

Edit: Also, we're all seeing different age ratings too. When I look at the app in play store, it's rated PG12. Others say it's 16, others say 18+. Maybe it's rated differently around the world.

Solutions: Thanks to those who commented the following solutions:

Don’t be such a control freak It is really hard to find porn on telegram. You really have to search for it, know the channel names, or know people that know channels.

I think they will find porn somewhere else but Telegram imo. MAYBE if only you actually DIG for it. i myself find it super strange that pavel durov, the founder of Telegram, didn't think about making Telegram appropriate for kids...

anyway, i know of a Telegram app named Teleteens, it's for kids, maybe this is  what you wanted  ?

If you let them use google they would have the same access to porn on telegram as on google. Maybe you can find some tools for telegram parental control around on the internet, but I think that is a bit of an overkill, unless you already monitor all your kid's activities on the internet. Now, you are their parent so you do whatever you think is best, but in my opinion this kind of constant surveillance is not good.

Edit to add something:  


I don't have kids but I use telegram with all my family which includes an underage cousin and his parents are ok with letting him use it Maybe I’m really dumb but I’m an adult who has been using telegram daily for over five years and I don’t have the slightest idea of how I could find porn in the app. At the bottom I have four options: contacts, calls, chats, and settings. Nowhere in that is groups. I have location settings off so it doesn’t suggest people or groups near me. Put it this way. Its as safe as your neice having Google installed. I can understand your paranoia. But TBH there isn't much you can do. If not today then tomorrow she will find a way. Occasionally keep an eye on her phone or take a peak into history. Inorder to find those kind of groups you will have to type something into the search bar. I can't even see any find groups feature, but I have been using Telegram X for a few years now instead of the normal client, might be that it lacks the feature at the moment. You could try Telegram X and see if that is a more suitable client for your kids. Not that I have seen any nsfw groups on other devices with telegram either. If you think that using telegram she will found porn here.. well you probably don't know, but maybe she was already introduced to porn just because of being curious and searched on google and because of no restrictions on sites like pornhub you can watch almost everything .. There are two ways to find adult content on Telegram: either by searching for it (through internet or via Telegram; a lot of adult channels/groups are not accessible through global search), or by nearby groups. The former case shouldn't bother you, as it is  as easy to find it on literally any other device. Your concern for the latter is legit. 

Having so much adult content in nearby groups honestly is frightening IMO. But: reporting those groups for being non related to location usually is OK, and Telegram will delete them. Otherwise neat trick: Telegram X doesn't have near-by feature, but still able to share your live location. Might work if that's your primary convern. The official age rating for Tele is 16+. Basically talk to your child. Maybe there are messaging apps out there which are designed for children which would suit you better. If you don't mind Zucc, Fb messenger has a kids version. I'd recommend Signal if you are really leaving WA due to privacy concerns. As for ""live location"", you could use whatever functionality is baked into your phone OS. 

On iPhone for example, I set up my ""family"" and can track the location of all devices in my family. If you aren't in a ""family"" you could add your niece as a friend to enable location tracking. 

I had Android till November but was the only android user in my circle so I don't know to what extent the android find my device can be used to track family members, but I'm sure it is doable. [https://support.google.com/families/answer/7103413?hl=en](https://support.google.com/families/answer/7103413?hl=en)

There are also android apps like Life360 that can handle the tracking for you in a much more detailed and proactive way than the functionality in WhatsApp ever did. Don't give telegram to small kids. Give them signal. Porn is filtered on Telegram for iOS Telegram.  Just use Telegram.  Secure, and as long as you have their account on your phone as well(for monitoring), you'll see it all. if you’re really spooked, log into her account and keep an eye on it every once in a while (with her/her parent’s consent). 

also, the GDPR makes the app only for users 16 years or older, and the App Store delegates it as 18+. so make of that what you will. >Don’t be such a control freak

Is that a ""yes"" to the question in the post then? Whether you're okay with your kid/s using it and accessing everything that the public groups offer?

Also, I am aware that Telegram is not the only source of all things - I'm not sure how that's relevant though. For example, if the public bus service were streaming porn on screens in the bus, you could say the same thing - ""that's not the only place to see it, so just let your kids take the bus"" - but it wouldn't diminish your right to ask other people what other methods of transportation they use, would it? I didn't find it hard at all, nor anyone else I know who used the app. And I wasn't even looking for it. Literally just looked at public groups and saw a few dead groups with 2 or 3 members, 2 porn groups with a ton of members (no pun intended), whose names were pretty obvious, and another big group whose name was just ""friends chat"" or something vague, which was also a porn group. In addition to another smallish group with people selling substances. Not on iOS, last time i tried if you join a porn channel on Android or PC it won't be available to see on an iPhone. That's perfect! Thank you! I'll definitely recommend to all of my friends and relatives with kids. Did not know about this, exactly what OP is looking for, an advantage to have third party clients on Telegram. I find it super bizarre that it's considered a bad thing to choose what your kids have access to.

Yes, we all had access to all kinds of things _before_ the internet was even a real thing. Everyone on earth knew at least one kid who knew where their parents' porn was and showed it to you. I'm not sure how that automatically means parents should take no measures to limit what their kids stumble into? Seriously it's just stupid to think that telegram is the main source of porn, cmon dont be naive! Thanks for the recommendations, I appreciate it. that's kind of truth - i know for a fact that a lot of channels and groups that are blocked in iOs are ok in Android, strange.. Thanks for the suggestion - someone else here recommended Teleteens though, and it looks like just the thing. If her parents (or any of my other relatives with kids) _do_ decide to ditch WA, that's what I'll share with them. Telegram doesn't shove porno in your face.  
Heck, in my 3+ years using the app, I've never seen anything even remotely sexual, despite my habit of joining random public groups.  

Your kids will find porno on it only by actively searching for it. I use Telegram exclusively for chatting with my friends and family. And as u/JustRandom2099 mentioned I haven't encountered any porno channels/groups for the 5+ years I've being using it.

There're all sorts of groups and channels on Telegram from movie, music to game downloading channels. But you won't find any of it unless you actively search for them.

But be careful when using bots, if some spam bot get ahold of your id, it might constantly add you to random channels/groups. Again, this can only happen if you willingly joined some sketchy channel or started a bot. Setting who can add you to groups in privacy settings to ""My Contacts"" can solve this problem I think. None of my friends and family even know about public groups or location based groups and how to find them. I think you will be fine. Telegram is so much more pleasant to use than signal, especially when losing or switching phones In my opinion you should teach them not to look for the things you don't want them to look at and make a good case why they shouldn't. 

The reason why I don't think that simply restricting access is a good idea is because I've noticed growing up that the kids that had the most controlling parents were the ones that tried to push and go against their parents the most, and came to resent their parents when they became older.

Even if there is nothing wrong with trying to shield your children as much as you can, you will never be able to shield them from everything, so in my opinion, is better to give them the tools to understand what's right and what's wrong themself and trust you did a good job, and not simply put walls around them they will eventually break.

But again, I don't have children and I have this opinion because this is how my parents raised me, and I like how I turned out. Maybe when or if I'll have children of my own I'll understand better your point of view. If you are really control freak about what your kids see on the Internet i would start first adding AdGuard Home or Pihole on your network. Telegram has to filter porn groups for iPhone users as well. I found it almost instantly, while not looking for it at all...

(Also, I think public groups are a fairly recent addition?) >more pleasant to use than signal

I know, I tried Signal. They seem to be far behind everyone else. You're describing basic parenting sense. Why is it that if a parent _prevents_ access to something _specific_, that the automatic assumption is that the parent is ""building walls around the kid"" while teaching the kid nothing?

(I'm not hostile against you, and I know your answer wasn't an accusation either, just for clarity.) Again, I've spent years on the platform and I've never had any ""surprise"".  
You must have searched for some porno-related keyword. I doubt your kids will do that so it won't be an issue.

(Nope. Since [March 13, 2016](https://telegram.org/blog/supergroups5k). ) Because I think you are, in a sense, building a wall. 

What I mean is that if you say ""you can't get out of the hose because this reason, this reason and that reason"" but you leave the door open, you are not only teaching what they can or cannot do but you are making them understand that you trust them, and they have a responsibility not to break your trust.   
While i think that saying ""this is bad because this this and that"" but then putting more restriction (the metaphorical wall) so they can't do the bad thing, can make them think ""why say that if you don't trust me to actually do what you say?"".  
I think that doing this things to build trust on little things (and in my opinion porn in particular is not that big of a deal, but I understand that is not the case with everyone, and it might not be for you), will be useful in the future so you can have trust on the big things.

In the particular case of telegram, I would be more worried about the ability of everyone to contact a user, because you can teach your kids to stay away from ""bad channel"", but it is a very different thing to stop bad people to contact your children. On that note, I think that if you don't use a username on telegram you are not reachable by strangers, but I'm not sure since I don't really care about that.

(I understand you weren't being hostile, and it's not my intention either, I actually do like this kind of conversations I have them with my relatives all the time) >You must have searched for some porno-related keyword

Again. Didn't search at all. No use of search bar. No keyword. No press little magnify glass symbol. No search. Just view list of groups, see groups. look, it all come from 2 simple questions : 1. do you think porn is healthy for kids ? 2. do you think kids have self control.

&#x200B;

the answer in my opinion is: 1. porn is not healthy. masturbation, sex - yes. but fast internet porn (not 1 magazine, but millions in the internet) is too much to handle.

2. kids don't have self control, it's a skill they need to learn, and it's hard to do while having this kind of thing around them all the time...

&#x200B;

your answer (as best as i can tell) is:

1. porn is not harmful.
2. kids have self control if you teach them.

and it's a good theory, in a sense that everyone who claims ''no one can teach that, we need to restrict apps'' will be met with your ''ha ! you are a bad parent, but i am so awesome parent that i have taught my kids to say no to any temptation and do homework 24/7 without asking for anything''

like the equation is: bad parent = need restrication apps, good parent = doesn't need anything You didn't use the search feature?  
Then how the devil do you have groups listed?  
I don't remember my first Telegram days but when I go in Groups now, I only find those I joined myself.  

You're either lying or you were invited into those groups.  
If it's the latter case, go to Settings-> Privacy and Security-> Groups -> My contacts.  
Now nobody except your contacts can add you to groups. I don't think that porn is good for anyone, because it gives a skewed view of sex in general and of woman in particular, but I think that one should talk to their kids about sex and what porn is so that they won't find it by them self (because they eventually will) and have who knows what reaction. 

But of curse the level of liberty you give to a kid depends on how old they are and who the kids is. There are very responsible kids and some that won't hear you, doesn't matter what you do.   
And I repeat, I like the laisser faire approach because that's how my parents raised me, and for now that is my only frame of reference of how you raise kids.  
   
But, going back to the first comment I made, and talking about telegram in particular, if you know that your kids can handle the internet in general, than there is no problem with telegram, but if you are putting down restrictions on their internet use, then you should check on their telegram as well.

So, to try to answer better to your comment:

1- It's not that porn is not harmful, but I think it's less harmful if you explain why it harmful and what it is and staff like that, and not try to block it all and act like it doesn't exist (not that I'm suggesting that is what you're doing, it's just to get my point across)

2- I don't know if you can teach kids self control, I don't even know if you can, meaning that until you're in your twenties your brain is just reckless. What I think you can teach is responsibility and trust, and I don't think you can teach that if you don't leave space for making mistake and suffer the consequences of the mistakes.  

I don't really think bad parents need restriction app, good parent don't. In my vision is more ""good"" kids don't need it, ""bad"" kids do (now we could be here days to discuss about what good or bad means, but I think you get what I mean), and some of the responsibility of whether a kid is ""good"" or ""bad"" falls on the parents, some don't (environment and eventual mental disability are there too). I never wanted to make a blank statement of ""this is good, this is bad"" because every case is particular for the particular kid and the situation. Of course if you are a stay at home parent and your only job is to look after the kids, you probably won't need much external help because you'll always be there, the situation is different if you work and it is normal that you want systems in place to check on your kids when you're not there; and it's not that one approach makes you a good parent and the other makes you a bad one.

Going back to of our conversation in particular, since you said your kid has a phone, it means that you're probably comfortable with let them be expose to some of the internet, and I don't think that telegram would expose them to much worst, especially if you check every now and then what they are doing. Now, I don't think you said how old your kid is, but if they are like 6 or 7, maybe you should look for tools that restrict the use of the app, but if they are like 15, they should be good with doing whatever.

I wrote quite a lot and I don't want to go back an re-read it, so sorry if there are any grammatical errors :) No, I wasn't _added_ to the groups, but can _view_ them. Swiping out from the left, choose ""nearby"" and there is a list of nearby individuals and groups. I'm not visible, but they are. If I tap a group name, I can read the entire chat. At the bottom of the screen it says, ""join"" - so I'm viewing without having joined. I haven't attempted to chat in any public group, but of course I assume that I'll get some pop-up telling me to join if I want to contribute. lol what a text wall

&#x200B;

you are correct - if all the phone is not filtered, there is no point in filtering telegram.

and you are also correct that restriction isn't anything. if i try to force an unwilling kid to have a filter - errr, not such a great idea. 100% agree with you.

BUT:

i think you might be surprised to hear that **the kids themselves** wants it, kids wants boundaries, because it gives them the feeling that someone is looking after them.

so if you have a kid that wants some boundaries, than you as a parent must have the tech tools to do just that.

i think that a lot of normal teenager can't be exposed to porn and live normally. because porn is not something as neutral bread or milk - you are hungry you eat it, and most of the time you don't even look at it, because porn by his very nature, draws the teen's attention, and not in a subtle way.

so a lot of teens understand that, and thus they try to find a way to avoid to confront this  very attention-demanding material. I’ll give you that. The local groups feature is full of nonsense that I wouldn’t want a kid to see accidentally. I have location always Off so I didn't even know that feature existed.  
To be honest, it's pretty well hidden and it's not something that you can click on by mistake.  
I doubt there isn't a setting to turn it off, but I'm not going to activate Location just to check that.  
Just tell your kids not to use it."

They entered the code correctly but not password. I'm just wondering how are they able to get the verification code, brute force?;2021-01-20 09:11:01;"They've either got one of your Telegram sessions, or your phone number. Check your logged in devices list in telegram, maybe get a new sim card issued if they have cloned your sim -- granted I'd think you'd have to be pretty special for that. My phone is the lone session.

Cloned sim card sounds terrifying since the login attempts is in another country. Are you just getting login code messages, or is it actually telling you that someone failed to pass 2FA?

It could just be someone keeps putting in your phone number trying to setup an account. If it's not that and you are seeing a message that says that they've used your login code but they didn't succeed because of 2FA to login, someone's reading your SMS texts, somehow. The latter. I first get the requested code, then an incomplete login attempt. Sending this as another message just to make sure you see it. 

If what you're saying is accurate and if you would happen to have a stalker, or otherwise hostile person in your life, please be careful until you get this sorted. The ""other country"" could be a sort of ""false flag"" where they're using a VPN to look like they're somewhere else.

If this person was hypothetically close enough to your phone (say an ex) they could've even installed some kind of spyware that would monitor most if not all activity on the phone, which would explain how they're able to read your SMS messages (though not necessarily why they'd still need to break into telegram).

All of that to say, not to freak you out, but do be careful and be smart. You can wait for some more people to wake up... But from all I know, that indicates someone's actively in your text messages; could be a lot of things (compromised app, cookie for something like messages.google.com, cloned sim, something on the carrier side, etc)."

Why would you want to see only half of someone else's convo? I do not understand what the feature is? Yeah, I didn’t understand what feature you’re talking about In a group of any size, someone could be being a dick - and you might not have the luxury of banning the person outright from the group. I can think of plenty of reasons why you would be MUCH happier with half a conversation.

* Public chat. Someone posts something inappropriate and admin is slow to react
* Family chat and your creepy uncle is making a scene
* Classroom chat. Two members decided to have an argument that you have no stakes in.

Etc. etc. etc. If you've never been in any such situations, count yourself lucky. It really can be quite uncomfortable.

I for one, totally understand where the OP is coming from. Why IS this banned, anyway? In group chats, blocked users messages aren't normally filtered out, this filters them out.

Honestly very strange it's against the TOS... From my brief period of using discord, even they had this feature.  It wouldn't entirely block people in a group, either, so you could peek at a message to see if it was actually worthwhile and you weren't missing important developments, but the blocked person was still unable to contact you directly, and any mentions were sent to /dev/null Oh I see, yeah, I always felt that was weird behaviour, but why would they want to prevent that change?  If the client is Free Software then you can modify it how you like. This is the op's source of confusion as well. yeah this , i dont get why"

It's low behavior. Let Telegram speak for itself. Of course Signal might be another Crypto AG, but one has to remember that using Signal is much, much better for privacy than using each of popular messengers owned by IT giants that will sell every piece of data about you they will be able to get. I stay with Signal for now because its privacy, not anonymousnesses. And how exactly is it a problem even if true? The code is open, I am not aware of any issue touching encryption and privacy so far. Can you say the same about Telegram especially the server part? Wrong sub. Well........... at least with signal you have the open source client that you can audit.

You don't have to rely on the server and trust the server to keep your things private.

you only have to trust that the e2ee is strong enough. and well implemented.

Same does not happen in the Telegram world. you have to trust them your data in their servers.

It is a compromise. I get it. Telegram has other great stuff (For example a good client that you can make reproducible builds and not electron shit like signal). If telegram was a Matrix/element client with e2ee it would be a massive killer The best solution is an open standard that nobody owns. [XMPP](http://www.xmpp.org) This could literaly be The perfect justification for An intelligence agency And how do you know the server side that signal provide us, is the same that is running on servers? No way to verify it, it’s always a matter of trust and I trust everyday less in USA based companies, foundations, whatever it is. The operative word being “Could”. 

Zero evidence to support that word. 

Equally it can be levelled at Telegram. 

I’m using both apps and whichever one wins out against WhatsApp will be my messenger of choice. 

I’ve a preference for Telegrams slick interface and features but Signals privacy is a real draw for me. 
If Telegram had E2E encryption on by default and not only in secret chats, then it would be a no brainer > and I trust everyday less in USA based companies, foundations, whatever it is.

Writing like a champ on Reddit, a USA based company. The point is you don't need to know. As Signal is fully open source you are sure the e2e encryption cannot by hijacked even if someone uses rogue server. I understand, actually. But Snowden even said that CIA/NSA (idk) had ways to get into SSH connections that are supposed to be secure. It’s USA man, we never know. Open source or not, it’s always about trusting others IMO. Everyone who bought encryption device manufactured by Crypto AG could dismantle and examine it. Nobody did it and the whole communication was easy to decrypt due to a ""hidden feature"". Some people buy a whole product, while some pay only for a special feature.:)

Masses need opensourceness, but it doesn't ensure anything. well in reality you can never be 100% sure it is about likelihood. And to me to trust fully open code when it comes to encryption is definitely why I do tend to use Signal instead of Telegram.

The other problem I have with Telegram even if I put aside home written encryption protocols and closed parts of the code, is that chats are not encrypted by default. Most of the communication I was having on Telegram was not e2e encrypted as when started by someone else, they either do not know about it or do not care. And if you want to start it later it is annoying for both sides as you have another chat instance. + if you use Telegram on your laptop e2e is completely missing"

“End to end encryption” is anything and everything, which occurs, within the transmission signal; is never exposed or accessible, to anyone for any reason, under any circumstances, if nothing breaks/penetrates the encryption signal, from one end, to the other end and it is not flawed.

Only the beginning end of the signal and the terminating end-receiver, have access to, the content(s) of the transmission(s).

If any leakage occurs, if will have to occur before and/or after, it enters and/or exits the, end to end encrypted signal.

These are the reasons why, the end to end encrypted “secret chat” mode can not be forwarded, backed up and disappears, if the encrypted displayed (text/audio) is terminated/deleted and can only be accessed, on/from the original, first device it originated/terminated at; because it only exist, inside of the “end to end, encryption signal.” 

Outside of the end to end, encrypted signal; any “existence” if you can, even call it that, is just garbled and makes no sense and means nothing; in whatever form it is expressed in: physically/visually/audibly/data packets, etc."

It’s basically a verification key to show that your call is secured on both ends. They are a representation of the e2e encryption keys, you can easily confront them with the person you are calling and if they match it means the call is secure.

Image or brief description to show differences between data collected by IM apps and good reasons to switch to Telegram.;2;l0oiqs;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l0oiqs/image_or_brief_description_to_show_differences/;2;"Hi to everyone👋 
With the growing discussions about Whatsapp’s terms changes, this is the perfect time to invite people to switch to Telegram, as it’s more secure and less invasive. So the question is, do you have some good type of content that describes briefly the differences between data collected by IM apps (whatsapp, telegram and so on)? Or some good content describing why is good to use Telegram? Something like a good image or infographic content, or also a brief text description, but I think this would be less effective. I was thinking about creating one but I believe that somebody with higher graphic skills than me has already done this. 😬

Apple sued for NOT deleting Telegram;111;l0m4z6;Telegram;https://youtu.be/gAMqvJdXPKI;75;;2021-01-19 18:33:14;"Ah Zuckerberg is at it again, if you can't beat your competition destroy them with government pork Lew got a point. If Telegram is being used in that manner, what about other platforms? You cannot intercept anything from Signal. What about that? The stupid is rising in cancel culture We should ban phones right away. Cancel culture could’ve only come from a place like america, no way in Europe would we put in danger what we fought for during hundreds of years.

They don’t realize the value of what they are trying to kill.
Fuck cancel culture It's stupid to punish the whole community for doings of some idiots. What's intresting is that Russia has tried to blocked it for simillar reasons. TL:DW?

I refuse to watch anything by this biased douche. That thumbnail face Meanwhile on Twitter, the Ayatollah is happily tweeting about death to Jews and apostates and such tweets only result in 24h suspension at worst. Some would think that this has more to do with financial interests of Telegram's competition than with any sort of principle.

But to be fair, I can see the argument for banning public groups and channels, because at that point they're not a private communications provider, but a platform. Invite-only would be fine afaic.

I don't think limiting the number of people who can be in a channel or a group is a good idea tho. In my country we used Telegram to spread and save video evidence of police brutality on protests and coordinate protestors to evade police attacks. Twitter deleted those videos because they were too gruesome. Idk, there's value in the size of those types of channels. Sorry if I cry BS on the logic why. I'm just waiting for the US to do to Telegram what they did to TON.
> Perhaps even more paradoxically, the US court declared that Grams couldn't be distributed not only in the United States, but globally. Why? Because, it said, a US citizen might find some way of accessing the TON platform after it launched. So, to prevent this, Grams shouldn’t be allowed to be distributed anywhere in the world – even if every other country on the planet seemed to be perfectly fine with TON. Wtf now ads in comments too? Are they are talking about the public channels? Is there a possibility there are channels preaching hate and/or racism? What's that about? Zuckerberg? 

Are you implying that he has something to do with this? 

I'm curious, if that's the case. I read something similar from Durov with the: 

>I hear Facebook has an entire department devoted to figuring out why Telegram is so popular. Imagine dozens of employees working on just that full-time.

So as it is it sounds like a fallacy because there's no article or news supporting that claim. Not that I know. But I'm really curious where's this coming from... 

Is there anyone who knows where are this claims coming from? Please! You can't on Telegram either. The channels in question are public for everyone to see. AFAIK there is some legislation being pushed in the states that advocates for having backdoors in encryption, so it can be accessed by other companies.

So... I just hope this isn't just a way to settle some precedence to push further that kind of actions. Because Telegram is just like Discord a social media. The torrent,apk and Deezer groups I use is chaotic. Everything comes full circle. *but what about mahh victim hood?!!* Funny you would say that. As Europeans we have much clearer and stricter laws against hate speech than the Americans have. ;D Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Brexit the culmination of nationalist bullshit that can and very well lead to exactly this, on top of Britian being one of the top surveillance states on earth? Russia tried to block Telegram because Telegram didn't agree to give FSB encryption keys ""Coalition for a safer web"" sues Apple for not banning Telegram despite having the same problems as Parler (hate groups, promotion of violence n stuff). Dude in video talks about the complicated nature of being a platform where it's hard to justify enforcing rules there but not here. He thinks it's weird for the organization to sue Apple over a messaging app, 'cause if that gets through, where does it stop. [deleted] >biased douche.

He's the least political and one of the most unbiased tech guy on YouTube, but whatever helps you sleep at night I guess... He was talking about their market research department Actually I think Telegram itself can read your chats if they wanted to (not that they want). Except for the secret chats with end to end encryption. [deleted] Well he said Europe not Britain. This island has our own special brand of stupid. And now they are unblocked. That made me lose a big chunk of trust in Telegram. What about whatsapp, doesn’t it have hate groups as well? Yes. He's a shitty scamming liar and I refuse to give him any views that further populate him and give him money.

Why would I support someone so shitty? American bringing politics into things, I see.

It's not about that. It's about him scamming. Pretending to giveaway hundreds of iPhones and giving away like 9.

He was part of a kickstarter selling a phone and never delivered the phone. Just kept the money. Used his YouTube to promote the kickstarter.

He is a scammer. Seems like you don't know the history of him and you're defending him for no reason. So whatever helps YOU sleep at night, supporting a scammer. And they do want. They limit accounts that share ToS-breaking content in private groups and channels, and they delete private groups and channels all the time.

I think the only reason they don't mod DMs is out of courtesy and for public image but they can indeed. >You legally can't say ""elton john had a threesome"" on tv or in print in the UK.

[citation needed], otherwise it falls under slander/libel laws and is also illegal in the US.

Remember, free speech is the government taking action against you for speaking against the government, and the States hasn't exactly been doing well. Isn't Europe a part of both Britian and the UK, because y'all decided border nesting dolls were a good way to deal with the monarchy? Afaik FSB had _huge_ troubles blocking Telegram. Maybe they just gave up Or more simple, the web itself? You ban Telegram because there can be hate groups, you should also remove the browser since with it you can access the same content... it's nonsense. I love telegram. But their focus on building communities, findable communities, does put them in the crosshairs more than WhatsApp, which leaves the community building aspect out. Sure, that‘s kinda the point. To be fair though, they are far easier to find on Telegram Difference is though, WhatsApp has a max group size of 256 and is not publicly searchable, whereas a Telegram group can have 200.000 people in there and is searchable.

Personally, I really wouldn't mind if Telegram scraps these public groups, I use it solely as an awesome chat app and prefer it over anything else. However, these hate groups are what destroy Telegrams image. [deleted] Seems like he lives rent free in your mind.
How is he 'biased' when he isn't? Just because you hate the guy, you call him 'biased', do you even know what that word means? That's all in response to people reporting users and groups. No that's the Isle of Man Unfortunately not :/

>Russia has halted its largely unsuccessful two-year efforts to block the popular messaging service Telegram.

>Russia’s federal media watchdog Roskomnadzor made the surprise announcement Thursday, citing Telegram founder Pavel Durov’s “stated readiness to counter terrorism and extremism.”

[Source](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/06/18/russia-unblocks-telegram-messenger-in-surprise-reversal-a70620) [deleted] I haven't found any... because I don't look for it. People used to plot coups with freaking pigeons. Absolutely disagree because everything is labeled a hate group these days. Yeah I'd be okay with them taking away public groups. We can still use the invite links to join groups. Not giving him views to bump his videos higher. Doesn't mean they don't go and check, or that they can't, just that they do it after they hear they have a chance of something. The fact is that they indeed have access to people's private chats.

 Whether there was a report or not is irrelevant. Besides, you're wrong. I was in a chat that got banned and wasn't reported, because I was the only person inside.

And the message they sent explicitly said that a moderator had come into the chat, seen the stuff my bot had automatically forwarded into it, and declared it illegal.

Perhaps they track media that is considered illegal and follow every chat where it is sent, without a report. The fact is that they can do it, and indeed do it often. Sorry, I misread Europe as England. 

Either way, Europe needs to deal with its nearly-Nazi island. *apple bans safari on iOS 15* Right but if you're into Qanon you can just type Qanon into the telegram search bar and immediately join some channels spreading misinformation. It would be just as easy to find channels promoting violence.

Telegram's position is reasonable: promoting violence is against their ToS so users should report those channels. I have found surprisingly many through ""what‘s in your area"" chat groups That makes three of us. What stuff was your bot forwarding into your one-person group? We're not even close to be Nazi. We have an incompetent government that is unpopular but we have to wait 5 years between elections, and the electoral system is really old fashioned and favours the Conservatives. It's all a bit shite. Nazi-like? How dense are you??

Did you maybe forget a few buzzwords? Let me help you: White-supremacist, fascist, homophobic, transphobic, islamophobic.

I hope that helps. We should get rid of the internet, just to be safe. Tens of thousands of media of anything anyone sent in any group where it is. Now it sends it through dm. I don't check it often, lots of pdf, like thousands of files. People do enjoy piracy. But there is a great variety of groups and some do indeed share illegal content. So, gradually going Nazi. Got it. Are you telling me Brexit wasn't primarily driven by a racist, anti-immigrant sentiment? I think we should get rid of Twitter before getting rid of Telegram. Maybe. Things aren't getting any better here that's for sure. What about the other -isms I named. Wasn't it also driven by them? I'd like you to answer my question first, please. Ok: The answer is ""Yes"" Fair enough. 

While there is nothing, as far as I'm aware, nothing directly trans/homophobic about the Brexit movement, the rest largely applies. 

The entire thing was primarily pushed using people's fear of people outside the Britian taking jobs that they *think* British people would be filling, and decentivise British people from leaving Britian to work in other countries. I don't see how that's any -ism or any -phobic? Aah, so you don't know what any of those ""buzzwords"" you hate so much mean. 

Congrats, my dude, you played yourself. What kind of weak argument is that? Is that all you have to say in defense of your buzzword rant? https://academic.oup.com/pa/article/70/3/439/3109029

Your turn. Prove me wrong.

> The vote for Brexit followed a campaign by several Eurosceptic groups—notably Vote Leave, Leave. EU and Grassroots Out—that had focused heavily on mobilizing public anxiety over immigration, the free movement of EU nationals and the further enlargement of the EU to encompass Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and possibly Turkey.

---

> Regarding feelings of community, a number of studies demonstrate how attitudes toward EU membership and integration are influenced by attachments to one’s culture and society, as well as by a ‘fear of others’ which plays a significant role in defining identities (Carey 2002; McLaren 2002). For example, research on support for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) has documented the impact of anxiety over the perceived negative effects of immigration (Goodwin and Milazzo, 2015; Clarke et al., 2016).

---

> Finally, there was a tendency to think that continued EU membership enhanced the risk of terrorism. Specifically, 21 per cent stated that the risk would be greater if the UK stayed in the EU and 16 per cent said the risk would be smaller if it left. When asked a second question on the topic, the difference was larger—47 per cent agreed that there would be more terrorism if the country remained in the EU and 28 per cent disagreed (see Figure 3).

---

> Negative attitudes towards immigration had highly significant effects (p < 0.001) on both types of benefit-cost assessments. As anticipated, voters with highly negative attitudes about immigration were more likely than other people to extol the benefits of Brexit and to minimize the costs of doing so. This effect obtained not only for the immigration-terrorism benefit-cost factor but also for the economy-international influence factor. Perceptions that Britain’s economic sovereignty had been lost to the EU mattered as well. Again, the effects are predictable; those who believed the EU had seized control of the British economy were more likely than other voters to see the benefits and minimize the costs of Brexit. Again, how is that any ism or phobia? Unless you mean xenophobia, which is a very hollow term. You are probably ""afraid"" of nationalists, right? That's xenophobia too. Alright, you're still both dumb and have nothing to add. Have a good one, my dude. So when I added something I didn't add something because I didn't agree with you. Could just have said that you only want agreement.... What, exactly, did you add? It's a 4 sentence comment, how hard is it to find meaning in it?

1. Your comment is missing what your copypaste supposedly is proving

2. ""xenophobia!"" is meaningless without context."

Just to name a few....";2021-01-19 02:01:15;"I use Plus. Pretty cool. I love customizing it every now and then, adapting it to my tastes, getting fresh new themes, removing or adding buttons. I like it. It also has many more chat features than Telegram official app, without losing anything from the original, so it's an obvious choice for me. It can be as vanilla or as custom as I want. I use Unigram on PC and think it's nice, more like native windows application than official one. Any concerns for security using ""Unofficial"" clients? There isn’t and official client for Ubuntu Touch yet (that I’m aware of) but Teleports works pretty well. well i havent saw this but now i am without my phone and using a unofficial web telegram and its fine... I use Ime messenger for Android.Its open source,but I dont know of it has reproducible builds.

It has extra features like forward to whatsapp ,text in stickers and neurobots etc.
Better than the original. Video calls haven't worked for me on any of the unofficial apps I tried, though BGram had some nice features I don't think there's one following GNOME's HIG but if there were I'd like to try it.

Right now all 3rd party clients serve a purpose for someone at least, I like that Telegram allows that.

Right now I'm on official Telegram and only thing I don't like is I can't use system titlebars in Wayland mode. I used to use Pidgin on Linux desktop and Telegram actually works great with it. The only things that didn't work were sending stickers and video chat. Even voice chat worked great. Damn- i miss-ed my IRC.. I often use Plus, but it'll become very buggy after awhile. There is another one that I tired which is Telegraph, looks richer in features than others. I'm using Plus for years now. Even after native folders feature landed on the official Telegram client I just can't use it and I like default Plus tabs instead. The only problem that I have with it is that sometimes Telegram introduces a new feature and it is not available on Plus immediately. It took so long to have polls working for example Some of the unofficial apps offer more features. BGram even has an option where you could use TOR to encrypt the app under its Proxy settings feature. I use a old versdion of nikogram because it can filter out posts from channels sol the dont come in channels, because telegram devs are fuckwits they claimed such a feature would break the tos and was removed in a later version More porn It doesn’t always track the main base of Telegram and sometimes does lag behind. That’s the major drawback with third party clients. Ive heard of UniGram for PC. I think it's the most highly rated alternative to the Desktop Telegram app. 

I'll have to check it out. Thanks! They can read your chats and other metadat  store and backup etc ; open source doesn't matter because the app they compile might have additional code compiled in to read your chats, , reveal location , record the time you are online , who you are chatting with and how often etc etc.
To be fair even telegram can technically do this in their official app , so it's upto you who you trust with your data. If it's web-based. How come you just dont use the ""Official"" Web version of Telegram? Any perks that your ""unofficial"" version offers that the other doesn't? Plus Messenger works perfectly for all audio/video calls. It’s gotten better over the years but it’s got its bugs. They’re usually UI bugs or lagging in features. Telegram will usually release a feature at the same time they add it to their libraries but give devs no time to implement it. Hmm if the code is in github doesn't it need to be compiled by github? That would avoid shenanigans of different code between the compiled and non compiled versions right? folders basically, the rest is more small things like design, and suport to animated stickers, i am using it for 2-3 days rn so idk all advantages about it, but it have more features for sure

if u want to try Awesome! Thanks. I'll give it a whirl. But the official telegram app has folders. Doesn’t it? They're talking about web-based clients Oooohhh. Sorry for that then."
Stickers too large for my taste?;1;l05rxk;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l05rxk/stickers_too_large_for_my_taste/;3;Is there a way to resize the stickers (animated or not) inside a chat? What I mean is compared to WhatsApp, they appear larger, so they take up more space and push more previous texts to the top. If devs could somehow implement this feature, that would be cool.;2021-01-19 01:42:03;Funnily, I've been trying to find a way to enlarge them to see them better (especially when choosing one from a pack) You could to use nekogram X (Android) it's the same telegram client but with few features extra (resize stickers included).

Does Telegram block Nsfw channels bases on my country code?;2;l04f9i;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/l04f9i/does_telegram_block_nsfw_channels_bases_on_my/;17;Appreciate if you can confirm this. Thank you.;2021-01-19 00:35:33;"Yes.
My UAE number cannot join such NSFW channels.
Tried from my India number and it works. u/newrabbid try this. Enable sensitive content via settings on its web client: web.telegram.org -> Settings-> Show Sensitive Content, and it’ll apply to all devices running the actual app. Restart your client app, and enjoy.   If this doesn’t work, something else is going on. Could you please elaborate I don't think anyone understands your question. As far as I know, they don’t block channels based on the phone number you used to register. However they do block channels if you are using an iOS device. There are ways around it,if you are.  Otherwise if you are on the android, web, or desktop app, they should not be blocked. Thank you for confirming Hi. I dont see this setting on the web app nor on the mobile app. Where is it? Thanks It’s obviously someone whose First language is not English, or is a lazy typist.  A country code is part of a phone number which is required to register for Telegram. It means exactly that: does Telegram block Nsfw content based on my region, which they would know from my country code. Seems like the answer is yes. After reading some tips online, pretty sure that setting is region locked as well. Can't believe telegram would bow down to my government On the web app, should be the three lines in the upper right corner, then settings, then there should be a radio switch for “show sensitive content”.  If you are on iOS, there are no options within the mobile app itself, only the web app I know what a country code is and I understand that english might not be the first language (but considering the accounts history the OPs understand of English is fairly advanced). But what does blocking by county code even supposed mean? You might try accessing the Telegram web client utilizing a vpn so that access is achieved outside of your region? This option is not available on the web app through laptop nor through mobile chrome. It is also not available on the official desktop app. 100% sure this is because of my country code. Disappointed One would assume that the op is questioning whether or not telegram automatically blocks NSFW channels by region, which would usually be determined by country code. Hence “blocking by country code “

Edit: as far as I have ever heard, telegram performs no blocking aside from iOS-specific NSFW channel blocking. I am in fact on VPN. No dice. If answering this question then as far as I'm aware telegram removes public channels/chats as by request of the copyright owner if the content is copyrighted. Or by government officials request. They do not remove anything from private channels/chats if they are not reported by members inside the chat/channel. I’m not sure what region you are in, but there are a number of online services to create temporary sms phone numbers etc.  I know for a fact that Google Voice numbers work to register on Telegram with, so I would recommend that you simply use Telegram with a different phone number , with a different country code, other than your actual one."

It’s ridiculous to push this mess to new users. Oh well. It’s free, I guess. What’s that? Add you to my contact? I just signed up and already I have over 100 contacts added to my list without my consent and I can’t delete them. No thanks! You don’t have to delete them one at a time. Go to settings > privacy and security > data settings > delete synced contacts t shows how to remove them. Thanks for trying to help, but I gave up and deleted the app. I spent almost an hour last night trying to get rid of everything in the chats and the process seemed endless. There must be thousands of them. I understand I can put them in new folders, but they’re still there. Almost every chat is about weed and in foreign language that I can’t read. I just don’t wish anyone I know to go through what I’ve just experienced. I just want a blank app. This is a terrible way to attract new users. Thanks! I see. Only one at a time. Why are they automatically added to my contacts as soon as I signed up? I have over 100 of them. How do you get rid of the chats then! It doesn’t feel very private. Oh wait, they weren’t your contacts? Then they might’ve been spambots. Kinda strange tho. Can you try to delete your account from my.telegram.org and create it again? Also, did you set up an username? https://i.imgur.com/gvEeyut.jpg Hey, that works. Thanks! Nope, I don’t know anyone on Telegram.

I had to delete my account first and signed up again. I just signed up last week, but somehow I had over 100 contacts and involved in more than a thousand of chats already.

I'd wish they'll remove the 'online', and 'last seen' statuses. Status updates. Has to be status updates. At the end of the day messengers and social media are melding. And the objective is to keep you on the app. So stories/status updates is the next logical evolutionary step. Discoverability features, some sorta main page with popular posts, like on Line. The reason for that is Telegram is a social media platform (even Durov said that), and it's lacking on that front compared to most others. There's currently no way to see a post from any channel unless you subscribed to it/searched for it or someone shared it with you in PM."

•Touch & Hold where it says ""Telegram for Android v7.3.1 (2206) arm64-v8a""

Jews are great, I'm literally married to one but *fuck* this piece of shit.

https://archive.is/pwRof is a readable link for those not subscribed. If you want context to my comment, a Jewish man has filed suit against Telegram claiming Nazi hate groups are organizing on Telegram.

This is exactly what happens when you push people off one platform: they go to another. Just because Telegram has been used by Islamic extremists and Nazi hate groups does not entitle you to crusade against the platform. The protections Telegram affords people fighting for fair elections in Belarus, for self-determination in Hong Kong, and for a free and open press in Russia are the same protections shared by all. And people wondered why even non-parler users where against this censorship in the name of hAtE spEeCH Apple likes to lick governments asses from all around the world. They're literally known for that. American, Russian, Chinese etc. They lick them all. If you buy iPhone, you should understand that any of your apps may lose support anytime. Why do I keep getting notifications of the posts from Telegram community which I am not following? This has ""Facebook money"" written all over it As Apple, Google, Amazon, etc. have chosen to head down the slippery slope of censorship, lawsuits, government/corporate media pushes to censor more will snowball. Let's, uh, pretend that other comment isn't there. What this is is the typical fearmongering bullshit that has lead to us taking shoes off on planes, encrypted messaging being seen as a threat because sometimes bad people use it. It's what the EARN IT act bullshit is about, it's what people use to stop things they don't understand.

A bad man can use gun to kill people, a social media platform to organize violent insurrections, a rock to beat someone to death, an encrypted email to buy weapons. A good man can use a gun to hunt and provide for his family, a social media platform to raise money for charity, a rock to build a fort with his kids, an email to order food. You know what the moral here is? We need to stop bad people, not the tools they use. They won’t. Telegram is actually one of the few chat services I’ve seen that allows you to report from a single message to a whole group or conversation to let them know something is fishy. The creator of the app even showed how they have been deleting groups used to incite hate and violence. But it’s kinda scary knowing these groups are asking to ban a service meant to be a chat group. Even worse... just targeting Apple when they should do the same to Google (even when Android is an open source, they are “hosting” the app), so it all sounds fishy (to me, at least). You would make one of the best decisions of your life. Been there. Done that. Do you really have to wait for it? ;) >Just because Telegram has been used by Islamic extremists and Nazi hate groups does not entitle you to crusade against the platform.

Yes, true, especially if Facebook and Twitter have so many messages/hidden groups with a lot of this shit. >Just because Telegram has been used by Islamic extremists and Nazi hate groups does not entitle you to crusade against the platform.

Alternatively, ""Just because Twitter has been used by Islamic extremists and Nazi hate groups does not entitle you to crusade against the platform.""

They're happy to agree with the second one. Telegram is guilty because they do not even try to prevent hate speech on their platform. Reports do fucking nothing to remove them. My country had to ban Telegram first so Durov had to act on it. He claimed he didn't know the Govt sent Telegram a formal notification. The minister told him his bullshit and he relented and started taking action. I'm sorry, are you referring to my comment? Because please do explain what you take issue with if you are. Whether this man was Jewish or Atheist or Black or White, they are a loathsome individual Bro, mentioning Jews online doesn't have to be taboo. Take your political-correctness to another 'safe space'. ""haet speach"" is just the latest boogeyman to keep us in the Face/Twitter/Google data monopoly.

It doesn't matter if you have rules moderating it or features to help ban people, if you are an alternative, you will be accused of being a ""nutzee platform"" and all the News Consoomers will believe it because The News said so. I used to have Android phones and switched to iPhone last year. It’s very well made but in iOS there’s always a feeling that there’s something missing. They removed so much in the last few days Because specifying he's Jewish is some weird energy lol. Why does it matter what he is, he's a piece of shit. Why did you feel the need to say ""I love Jews but this guy is a prick?"" Well we are on a leftddit after all. It's all about being politically correct. That’s why there are some rules against monopolistic practices, which Google, Facebook and Apple have been accused and they haven’t been subtle with them. What they did with Parler had a lot to do with “hate speech” which, if you read all the Terms and Conditions of any platform, if they break that rule, there’s a suspension, even a ban. One can complain and cry about it calling it “unfair”, but if you read closely and carefully before signing and commenting, you’d know that the unfair would be letting you do it even if you feel powerful and call it “freedom”.

Internet is free, for sure, but Twitter, Facebook, and every other company are not. They’re private, and in order to be there, you must follow rules. Imagine you want to go to a restaurant, and you want to go there and eat anything there’s there. But if you don’t follow certain rules, including your own manner and behavior, they have the right to kick you out. You may not like this comparison, and that’s okay. I’m no one to bring light to others, but at least show there’s a difference between “freedom” and “attacking people and acting in such violent ways” and defending it as “freedom of speech” which, spoiler alert in case you want to do some personal research, is not. İ am a bit of a tech geek, i like to explore the limits of a device, customize to my taste and find hidden features that nobody around me knows. You cant do that with an iphone. İts a solid phone, well built but its just not for me. Because I specifically wanted to point out that despising this person has nothing to do with him being a Jew. And it is relevant to the lawsuit he has filed, since they claim Telegram has created a safe harbor for anti-semitism which they feel threatened by. Yet my Jewish wife feels safe using Telegram as I'm sure tens of thousands of other Jews do.

You shutting me down because ""don't mention what ethno-religious class he comes from"" denies the essential thrust of this man's lawsuit and its origin. I agree as a tech geek it is the best decision to move to Android and customize it, but for normies i see no choices better than an iPhone. Maybe I read too much into it, sorry if that's the case. It sounds like we're both otherwise making the same argument so all good!

And thank you for apologizing over the internet. That's a rare sight and I really appreciate it."
I have made this cool video, explaining Telegram great features. People out there who are new to Telegram can check out this one. As everyone is shifting to Telegram, thought this kinda would be useful.;83;kzscs5;Telegram;https://youtu.be/WpVBTqMk9Tg;13;;2021-01-18 13:45:31;"The sound effects are overly loud compared to your voice.

I would've also mentioned the great desktop clients as that's something that Telegram has going over both WhatsApp and Signal which have very limited desktop experiences. Like the feature video. Background sound is a bit loud, but other than that well done! Damn right. I am dailya  Desktop version user. Excellent user experience. Hey, thanks for the feedback.

And yes, including the desktop Feature would have been more great for guys not aware of it. Perhaps you could be able to explain this.

Why is it that no matter how big you make your fonts, Telegram's menu, text edit box & chat-list fonts remain tiny?

In short, font modifications on Android only apply to sent or posted text. The rest of text remains tiny. Why? Yup, I realised it later that the background sound is a bit loud. And I am really glad that you liked the video. True that ! I was unaware of this, would surely check this one out. That's a GREAT question, and something that needs to be fixed! I use Plus Messenger (another client for Telegram) which has advanced theming options to solve these issues and more. Not aware of this messenger App, Thanks for the suggestion. Will check this out ! It's called ""Plus"". It's a green circle with a white dialogue cloud and a plus icon. Hey thank you, will definitely check out."

Who here uses the self-destruct timer?;2;kzr9jv;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kzr9jv/who_here_uses_the_selfdestruct_timer/;8;"Among my contacts I'm already kind of the odd one out for using secret chats only. But lots of people ask me why I always activate the self-destruct timer (at 1 week usually). My answer: why the f would you not? It's the opposite scenario that weirds me out.

The un-overheard spoken word is the gold standard of private communication. Obviously I would want to simulate it as much as possible. This includes not allowing for the possibility of people quoting something I said years ago. This is also why I have never backed up my chats and I think it's a weird thing to do if you're concerned about privacy and discretion. 

TL;DR 
I think the extra privacy created by the self-destruct timer is considerable, and people are being contradictory when they demand both privacy and an extensive, uncomplicated backup function.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kzr9jv)";2021-01-18 12:19:07;"You don't need it for private chats, because both sides can remove any message from any time. You can remove all your messages and messages of another side. I like to be able to read my old messeges also I like to use web telegram.

I never use secret chat and never use self-destruct Every way of backups is insecure, that's why I prefer secret chats over whoever app claims to be E2E by default but allows backups but no ways to clear entire chats. They are device specific and so many other things that makes them more convenient and private in certain cases. 

But... 

Personally that's too much. If you have to do that to talk to friends, then, bro, those aren't your friends or you're a little bit paranoid. I get where you're going, but we don't have to be that extreme if you know your people (please, don't come up with the ""you'll never know them entirely"").

Again, that's personal preference and you may have a reason to. But for everybody else, that's just overcomplicating things. 

Sometimes people are telling me to send them files again, bots I mentioned, and other things. I don't want to be resending all of that again. Just search for it in the conversation. ....I think you answered yourself there, no? Well, the alternative would be to clear the chat every once in a while. But I prefer that it happens automatically. Well, I think if you believe that some sort of international intelligence agency is actually interested in the plain text of your messages, you are not exactly the opposite of paranoid.

I show my face when I'm around my friends. But that doesn't mean that I necessarily want them to have an extensive collection of footage of my face on record. No Well, you can delete only the messages you selected. Okay, I understand. It makes sense."

I am trying to use Telegram Linux x64 since Telegram Web is not fully compatible and you will miss some messages only supported by the app.

But I cannot use cedilla for example ""ç"". It is mainly used within the Portuguese language.  
"" ã "" does work but cedilla shows "" ć  "" which is terrible.

 I have cedilla enabled on my Ubuntu env system since I use both Portuguese and English language. Telegram tho somehow, totally ignores my system keyboard setting and I cannot change it either.

I have checked its setting and there is no such option available?

Does anyone has any idea to fix this??

Normal chats are not e2e encrypted. Why so?";2021-01-18 02:11:10;"Regular chats intentionally use strong encryption that isn’t e2e so that the chats can back up and sync across all your devices, and your precious chat histories saved as long as you want them to be. As long as you trust Telegram, this is all you need. Secret chats are for things that are literally so private or illegal that you can’t take the 0.00001% chance of anyone ever reading it who isn’t supposed to. Keep in mind, even with a secret chat, your recipient can just take a picture of their screen with another device, or their device might be hacked/compromised such that no encryption serves any purpose. Nothing is 100% secure. You can read here about the reasons telegra dot ph /Why-Isnt-Telegram-End-to-End-Encrypted-by-Default-02-23 (reddit bans it). However, Durov recently said that they are working on e2ee group chat t dot me /s/durov/146. For cloud sync to work Because when you start ""secret chat"" (e2e) you lose the best feature of Telegram: cloud sync across your devices. Exactly. Probably to make backups of the chat easy. but I prefer signal and using it for my personal chats. Yeah, this is one thing that I didn't understand either.WhatsApp as bad as it is, you can use it on your mobile and web without worrying that there is no end-to-end encryption.

This is a very poor choice by Telegram team.

Signal, I can use on my mobile and PC without worrying about security but unfortunately, only my IT friends adopted it. The ordinary public is Telegram. What do you define as strong? Telegram can still read your messages in group chats. You know that Screenshots are impossible in private chats? I am not sure if you meant regular or private chats. >back up and sync across all your devices,

WhatsApp does that just fine, with e2ee. Why can't Telegram? Yeah blindly trust telegram. That’s all you need. Thanks, I read over [here](https://telegram.org/faq) ""Why not just make all chats 'secret'?"" and it seems mainly so that backups can be done. Apparently WhatsApp's decryptable backup philosophy is insecure. Yeah WhatsApp does mobile and web with e2ee so why can't Telegram? I'm genuinely curious as to why they don't. I thought it might be more resource intensive to have e2ee chats and so maybe that's why by default they've disabled it. Lol, signal is american company and they may have backdoor for the government. Messages are encrypted [from your phone to the telegram servers](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto). Unlike WA that for a long time you could sniff on the network and see plain data. This allows to sync chats on multiple devices.

**E2E encryption is point-to-point,** so no telegram server is reached. That means that you cannot sync the data across multiple devices. This is because the [encryption model](https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end). Sync would imply that you share the private key, which is kinda stupid if you know the basics of encryption.

So yes, OP question is kinda stupid and requires a little bit of technical research before yelling. (is not hard to find [telegram.org/faq](https://telegram.org/faq) LOL) OP meant that one can literally take a photograph of a chat on the screen in the Telegram app with another device (e.g. another phone or a standalone camera). Uh? You can screenshot private chats on every device and you can also screenshot secretchats on ios It doesn't Does WA supports multiple devices sync?

No.

Why not? Yes, not just apparently [link](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/136072/how-can-whatsapp-restore-local-or-google-drive-backups?rq=1). Honestly, at this point, as an early adopter, it just seems that they are being lazy.

When Telegram first released there wheren't many implementations of synced e2e chats, and WhatsApp is not synced, it just connects to your phone.

However, with a change in protocol, and how they marketed themselves, I think lazyness took over, and nothing came out of it. I am still rooting for Telegram, it is an awsome product, but man, they really are lacking in some areas. How do you know Telegram isn't backdoored, either? America fucks with every country. What are you talking about?? 

Statunitian and many countries use TikTok which is hosted in China.  
Do you wanna anything worse than that? 

If the government there doesn't like you adios life my friend. Only God knows what they are doing with its 800 million active users worldwide.

Back to Signal, the CEO has a totally different point of view than Facebook.   
Brian Acton left WhatsApp for being against Facebook plans with users data, and now he is a Signal member of the board.

You are comparing water and wine... [Citation needed]

But don't bother, Signal is open source, you can just check what they do to see that there isn't a backdoor >Messages are encrypted from your phone to the telegram servers.

Which doesn't negate my point: Telegram can read your group chats.

>E2E encryption is point-to-point, so no telegram server is reached.

Your own link seems to disagree: ""Encrypted data is embedded into a messages.sendEncrypted API call and passed to Telegram server for delivery to the other party of the Secret Chat.""

 >That means that you cannot sync the data across multiple devices.

Maybe not with Telegram, but technically it is possible.

>Sync would imply that you share the private key, which is kinda stupid if you know the basics of encryption.

Each device gets a priv-pub-key. No need to share keys. Yes, you can take a Screenshot on IOS, but it notifies the other user that you took the SS. Ok Android you cannot take de SS. [deleted] True, I misunderstood ""multiple device sync"". Sheep I don't know. It's better not to trust anyone. But at least Durov is not under US. I'm sorry, but I don't understand any of your paragraph. There is evidence to believe that what the person you're replying to said is true. How many people are possible to read the code? It's not easy to read someone's code even if you are a programmer. Telegram clients' code is also open-source and you can read it, but it doesn't bother people and they still use WhatsApp. I won't trust American company, because they are under USA jurisdiction. >Which doesn't negate my point: Telegram can read your group chats.

Yeah? And? You were using whatsapp for years and did you care about your info in there?

&#x200B;

>Your own link seems to disagree: ""Encrypted data is embedded into a messages.sendEncrypted API call and passed to Telegram server for delivery to the other party of the Secret Chat.""

Tell me how you will make an implementation to find a user and deliver the message if you don't have destination to reach, smartass.

&#x200B;

>Maybe not with Telegram, but technically it is possible.

Telegram designed simple server-client encrypted in the way for normal chats, not to hide stuff fron CIA, NSA, your mom. If you want to feel like Bin Laden, use Secret Chats.

&#x200B;

>Each device gets a priv-pub-key. No need to share keys.

So you break the concept of E2E, and have to re-encrypt and re-send the message the amount of times of devices you own. Yeah, you forgot you have descentraliced network and a handheld device has to start acting as server...

&#x200B;

Do your own Messages app dude, you seem to have an IQ surpassing Ainan Cawley.. don't waste your potential. I like to see people that loves making a critic for everything that's done from other people (and this is a non-profit project financially supported by it's creator and using a custom designed open source protocol, as well the app is open source, so nobody want to steal your grandma wifi password).

If you hate Telegram, go to Signal. This is /r/Telegram I said private chats, not secret chats. [deleted] America fucks with the whole world, not just itself. Any provider anywhere can be backdoored, though the Signal client supposedly never sends your private keys to its servers, hence the e2ee. Do you have links?? That's the beauty of open source: You don't need to have trust. You can literally see what is being done.

And if there was a backdoor somebody would have found it, especially now that people have an actual interested in taking down their competition now that WA is bleeding users. The other guy seems clueless. The second I read his definiton of E2E i stopped reading his useless post.
Guy with his big mouth. > Yeah? And? You were using whatsapp for years and did you care about your info in there?

I ditched WA the second FB bought it. And why the whataboutism?

>Tell me how you will make an implementation to find a user and deliver the message if you don't have destination to reach, smartass.

You said point to point. I just wanted to point out that the server IS involved.

>Telegram designed simple server-client encrypted in the way for normal chats, not to hide stuff fron CIA, NSA, your mom. If you want to feel like Bin Laden, use Secret Chats.

So? Still doesn't negate my point: Telegram and anybody with access to the servers can read your chats. And you can't e2e groups.

>So you break the concept of E2E, and have to re-encrypt and re-send the message the amount of times of devices you own. Yeah, you forgot you have descentraliced network and a handheld device has to start acting as server..

What about this breaks the concept of e2e? It's not re-encrypting, it's encrypting. Once per key. I don't even know what the rest of this paragraph is supposed to mean.

>you seem to have an IQ surpassing Ainan Cawley

Why so aggressive?

>as well the app is open source, so nobody want to steal your grandma wifi password

Why would Telegram have my Grandmas Wifi password?

https://www.vocativ.com/news/307106/whatsapp-encryption/index.html

I do find it weird that such info doesn't appear to be in Signal's website just for the sake of transparency. And of course, interesting that it is based in Silicon Valley where Google and other big tech reside who don't have a stunning reputation for privacy. 

I'm curious as to why Signal hasn't done much to offshore their servers to some place like Switzerland. Must be a clause we don't know about. >That's the beauty of open source: You don't need to have trust. You can literally see what is being done.

**Of course** is involved. That doesn't implies that the actual message is sent to the server or stored.

&#x200B;

> So? Still doesn't negate my point: Telegram and anybody with access to the servers can read your chats. And you can't e2e groups. 

They could but [this](https://telegram.org/privacy) dissipates your fears.

> What about this breaks the concept of e2e? It's not re-encrypting, it's encrypting. Once per key. I don't even know what the rest of this paragraph is supposed to mean. 

Ah okok, this really clarifies you have no idea of serverless message encryption for multiple destinations.

&#x200B;

> Why so aggressive? 

If you don't like something open, free and heart-driven, just don't use it. But don't come to criticize like the typical *I-know-it-all* and *I-could-make-it-better,* since smarter people is behind this and making an amazing product caring about privacy, feature usage, and keeping it free as fas as possible to make people like you use it without concerns.

&#x200B;

Also, don't play hypocrite.. dude, first you criticize and you came latter on with a

 *I actually really like Telegram and have at least 3 bots running*

&#x200B;

I'm stopping here since seems like you like to complain just because complaining is free.. Get well. You're being too aggressive. 

I clearly said that there's a difference between Private Chats (Cloud Based) and Secret Chats (E2E).

Private Chats > Can be screenshotted from every device with no limitation.

Secret Chats > Can't be screenshotted on Android but can be screenshotted on iOS with the cost of the other user receiving a notification.

Even if on Android you can't normally take a screenshot, nothing is preventing someone to take a picture of the screen of the phone or rooting the device and avoiding that limitation. It is something you can easily bypass, either by using another device or my screen recording and opening the app. Anyone with half a brain would understand what the parent comment was saying, referencing both screenshots through the device or literal shots of the screen from a separate phone or camera. Yes, that's why I wrote the second half of the comment. >What you were using since then?

Telegram

>Of course is involved. That doesn't implies that the actual message is sent to the server or stored.

It says in your link that the encrypted message is sent to the server. We don't know whether it is stored.

>They could but this dissipates your fears.

It doesn't.

>Ah okok, this really clarifies you have no idea of serverless message encryption for multiple destinations

How do you think this is an argument?

>If you don't like something open, free and heart-driven, just don't use it. 

I said in my last message that I do like Telegram. I am just not a bleeding heart fanboy.

The initial points still stand: You can't e2e groups and telegram (and everbody with server access) can read your groups. Why does that upset you so much?

>first you criticize and you came latter on with[..]

Come on. Everything I like HAS to be above criticism? What kind of mindset is that? You're right - open source is better. Then why Signal? There are better options for even P2P. ;) [deleted] I'd love to hear them. Always open to try new stuff. XMPP/Jabber? >E2E does not mean there is no server involved

Was it too hard to understand that I literally said the opposite? Sure. No, not so simple :D  Tox, Jitsi or Jami. I'll check them out, thanks! I have been playing with the idea of running my own server for my family and friends, but then you need to stay on top of patching....

Also, that option isn't in there, plain and simple, next time make sure to do better research about an app before migrating you and your friends to it 10% and I got the text size in smallest option. I did check the app, it's good and that's why I can't believe it doesn't has this option... This can't be true...

I am in other groups who don't have the avatar and have messages from 4 different persons, but they don't have the option to normal members to write... Pretty sure what you're referring as groups are in actuality channels, which basically work like a news feed True... Guess I'll wait. Everyone that migrates from WhatsApp will not like the avatars... Phones have limited space as it is, what a wrong decision to have in a group chat.... To be fair, phones nowadays are quite large/tall and in here avatars are extremely small, their size really depends on what the person has setup in their phone's display size/scale settings (which can be easily changed on Android, not sure about iOS)

I personally tend to use the very small option as it fits more things into the display (i don't like how crammed and big things are in the default screen scale) I have always the smallest option selected in all apps. But the avatars are a waste of space in my opinion. Hope they make an option to remove them."
Create a pack with webp animated stickers;2;kzg7hp;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kzg7hp/create_a_pack_with_webp_animated_stickers/;4;I have some animated stickers in webp format that I want to import to telegram.

Trebuchet MS is a humanist sans-serif typeface that Vincent Connare designed for the Microsoft Corporation in 1996. It is named after the trebuchet, a medieval siege engine. The name was inspired by a puzzle question that Connare heard at Microsoft headquarters: ""Can you make a trebuchet that could launch a person from main campus to the new consumer campus about a mile away? Mathematically, is it possible and how?"" Connare ""thought that would be a great name for a font that launches words across the Internet"". Trebuchet MS was the font used for the window titles in the Windows XP default theme, succeeding MS Sans Serif and Tahoma.

I can't connect to Telegram Desktop (Windows version) for several days now. I tried to contact telegram support, but they read the message I sent but no answer... When I download the program I get the warning saying that it may damage my computer.;1;kzd3np;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kzd3np;10;;2021-01-17 22:31:14;"With the vague of new members, the support is hella overcrowded (think a new question every 1-3 seconds). Don't hesitate to ping them from time to time, they will pick it up eventually.

Now, about your question. Just to make sure, you did download it from the website of Telegram, not some third party? Also, can you share a video of your steps? Alrighty, in my country after Telegram was blocked I was was able to access [telegram.org](https://telegram.org), but couldn't get into Telegram itself, try with VPN, if ii will login then search for some telegram proxies in online search Try installing it from Microsoft Store And check also you have no firewall problem. Is that from home or some public/company network? Can you access telegram.org and web.telegram.org? Hello, thank you for your answer! I downloaded it from telegram website. I installed it like a normal program. I'll try to make a video of my steps. Hello, I tried it, but no luck... Thanks anyway :) Tried to open Microsoft Store, bue apperently, it doesn't work on my computer, it can't connect to the internet... xD Yes, I can access to the websites with no problems. Just can't connect with the program. I can access telegram web normally and use it. In my phone the same thing. I'm connected to my house internet. Thanks again. So have you tried to just say ""execute"" on the warning screen you have? From my understanding, it's just windows saying ""I can't analyse the content of that program for some reason"". There is no reason Telegram will hurt your computer, if you have the official one. I know that, I use it for a long time now, but it suddently stoped working properly..."

I'm trying out Telegram as a replacement for WhatsApp, and everything seems to work fine except video calls. They can start fine, but soon the framerate goes down and soon it's like a slide-show, plus the sound get bad and often not synchronized.
Is the video call function in Telegram this bad, or is it overloaded servers right now, with the big influx of WhatsApp-migrators?

Even some short low-quality phone videos of 10-20 seconds (up to 20-30 MB) are uploaded slower now. And even for downloading them from server it take some more time that took previously. This could be caused by the recent massive user migration from another platforms and a possible server overloading?;2021-01-17 19:30:25;"Yes I’m noticing that too I'm noticing that for like past half a year. It depends on where you are and which Telegram server you are downloading from.

In my case, yes I noticed it's slower than before. In Poland it’s veeeeeery slow. 1,5 years ago it was working way faster. I downloaded an episode of a series that I watch and it was lightning fast earlier today. So maybe it was an overload indeed."

So I don’t know which one will be the web replacement with so many options xd lol, imo probably the first one you send since it has the folders and was the 1st place on the conquest some others doesnt have folders and the 2nd and 3rd was basically the same so imo there was some code issues on they is there a way to search for stickers in the web telegram? i was only able to search on desktop app, at least for what i saw I wouldn’t be that sure. Why would be the contest organized for then?
And the most important, the first I went is not mobile responsive... the ones from the contest are responsive and you can use them from mobile browser. 
I dare to say the first one I sent you is just an alternative for the ones that like it, same as Telegram X. That first one I sent you is really well maintained, it’s actually the only web one that support VoiceChats at this moment. i thought the contest had already ended, my bad"

Does someone knows which is the intention behind making this chat visible most of the time?";2021-01-17 17:17:55;"To essentially act as quick access personal cloud for texts, images, videos, files etc, it's not hideable most likely so you can always forward things to it You can always forward stuff to archived/hidden chats. I don't think that's an argument that could explain this behavior. How do you forward things to an archived chat? Whenever I try it only shows my non-archived chats, I'm on the latest beta version of the app btw (same thing in the stable release) Just select the contact instead of the chat. Archive is hiding. That's the point, to not having it in plain sight. The thing is, how do I select a contact if it is hidden? Ehrrr.. you can't hide a contact? What do you mean by a hidden contact? Ok, tell me the exact steps to forward something to an archived contact/chat, when I select a message and tap forward, all that shows up are the non-archived chats, where do I go from there? Archive chat with contact B, go to chat A, forward, contacts, select contact B..

Archive a chat is not ""archive a contact"". Ok, I think I figured out here, in forward I have to open the search bar then search for the archived chat, that worked here, there was no contacts option

And about the archived contact thing, that was just a way I was referring to an archived chat with a specific individual You can drag the chat list to reveal the archived chat That doesn't work when forwarding, I've tried I’m doing it right now dude. Lol? If you were just referring to being able to access the archived chats from the chat list then yeah, I was already aware of that, if you were referring to being able to drag to access the archived chats in the forward list that just doesn't work (at least not in here) I think you're making a mess of features and app navigation, and this is getting very out of context at least for the topic in here.

My question is if Telegram has formally justified this behavior (saved messages cannot be hidden). Alright, the answer to your question is simply no, Telegram hasn't given a particular reason as to why saved messages cannot be hidden"

I saw this feature on the Telegram website, but did not really understand what it does, it does not just open the link like in a browser? So what does it do? How is it different from a regular link? Telegram should promote templates for channels and groups allowing to set a list of the rhash(s) to unlock templates optionally. Open the templates approvals every 2 years seems a joke! The instant view (IV) show a web pages choosing some of their elements. The result it's a very light content to display. The rules that describe which elements must be used are called IV templates

Telegram X folders - willing to contribute;0;kz2pps;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kz2pps/telegram_x_folders_willing_to_contribute/;10;"Hey, I'm power user of X and things I super like abt TGX are
- can stop animation of stickers after first loop
- gestures - share & reply
- own theme creator - have one my pink vaporware
- no bubbles - bubbles for me are huge visual noise as I'm used to IRC/Riot,Element stuff
- custom emojis - somehow I like joypixels
- chat previews - all of us have that one chat they want to just sneek without being spotted.

I've give two shots to original Telegram recently but few things still there which distracts me from being focused on conversation while on mobile.

I propose I'm happy to test some early versions of TGX or contribute $ to have 
- folders
- group voice chats

Why not make TGX as paid version? I guess there are bunch of people who would love have some features and that could cover at least some development costs.

Disclaimer, I know TGX has own folders.";2021-01-17 11:27:09;"Unfortunately Telegram X is a closed project, so no way to contribute. You can use the built-in folders in TgX. If you don’t know them, tap on CHAT tab above and slide down at that moment. I think Reddit is not a proper place to ask these questions. You can try on their github, telegram chat or twitter. What I found on officiall web https://telegram.org/apps there is only GitHub for https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram which is Telegram for Android and no way to open issue, only PR. 

For TGX on web there is only APK or store link. Looks like you're right. The last update was in May 2020. Well you can try to write a comment under the app on the store. They also have a beta. You can get it here: [https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.thunderdog.challegram](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.thunderdog.challegram) Yes, I'm beta, just wrote private feedback :) Unfortunately I don't know anything more about it. As it hasn't been updated since May, I'd started using the official client. Afraid of security? Or why so? Maybe this too. Why would any use abandoned client, if there are up-to-date ones? :) It has no video calls and some other features the offical one has. What features do you miss? I don't do video calls tho :)

I guess regards security, I assume TG would put big notice there is security change and this client doesn't cover it, don't you? Or may they don't. But I recall their mtproto had security issues 8-9yrs ago. I've stopped using X more than one year, so I don't know what features it has. Also I mostly use desktop client, because I rarely use phone. Regarding security issues: I'm not aware of them. Their protocol still can has security issues, I don't know."

I will release a small starter project though for anyone to get started and release their own telegram bots. Hi, I made this bot. You can watch a sample workflow here. https://youtu.be/rsXYr7gBhR4 . Bot link is in the video description. No support currently. Will implement it if there is enough demand. Also with images and videos the exports will be huge files and processing costs for such huge files will cost me a lot.

How to organise telegram folders;42;kz0dvs;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kz0dvs/how_to_organise_telegram_folders/;16;"One of the most underappreciated facets of the awesome app. I realised it after a lingering time after spending some time with it. 

Here's how to organise your Telegram Folders. 

1. Archive all chats. Delete the ones you are no longer a part of. 
2. Create folders with specific chats. For example, I created mine with labels- family, frequents, groups etc. 
3. Family members with unmuted chats are not part of other groups. 
4. In a ""to-do"" folder- only the people reaching out to me are listed- once I have addressed them, they get archived automatically. They are those people whom I don't need to reach out commonly. 
5. Frequently contacted are excluded from the ""to-do"" folder (as on point 4). 

It will take some permutation and combination to work around the folders but your digital life is saner and organised.";2021-01-17 08:33:45;"And I was just thinking, how cool would be to have 2 different “tabs” one for group chats and one for individual chats. I guess with folders I can manage. you could create “self channels” to archive your stuff too, if you're so inclined: documents, pictures, porn, you name it. Also you can pin messages on folders and they don't mess up with the rest Personally, I'm kinda let down by the folders. They do a lot of neat things, but the thing I hate is, you can't remove chats out of the 'all' folder, get rid of that folder in general, move it away or just mute it. Therefore, I still find myself using the main view 99% of the time, as everything is right there. 

Only solution would be to mute and archive every chat so I won't find them in the 'all' folder and have to go the folders, but that's impractical as well so.. idk it's just not as good as I hoped it to be and unfortunately, they haven't improved it since they launched it and I doubt they ever will Neat! I can add my take, as I work in crypto have something to tell

I have DMs in **Personal**, then destilate that group in **Close-up** to people who I either respect or have positive impact on my wellbeing.

Then I have **Substrate** (ecosystem framework for chains) and from there I have **Edgeware** related channels (where I work as chain-contractor.)

Then I have **hustle** folder where I work on some sidegigs or channels group have personal touche

And to not be noised during day I have **Low-prio** where I realized I hangout too much and should cut it. 

Only issue is, that folders doesn't sync to telegram X - I have it bc of my vaporware theme and custom emojis set. The main issue with the folder is about the exclude filters that doesn't work on a specific entry, so if I have a folder with some news channels the exclude read filter doesn't work I just use plus > I guess with folders I can manage

Yep Yup, it saves time finding people in bunch of bots and groups. I did it like [this](https://imgur.com/stLyYHa). Fairly simple tabs, but efficient for now. Yeahhh this!! I like this, private channels only for you, thanks I think pin up to 100 chats and then organise them. 

And they all sync beautifully! Archive everything and then the folders start making sense. 

It is convoluted at first but I managed to hit it through hit and trial. I had some free time yesterday and nailed it. 

The big advantage is that it helps the flow of information- no distractions whatsoever. I kept a folder especially for those who reach out to me- and kept one for those whom I like to contact frequently. 

Simple. Keeps things very well organised. Plus has terrible implementation with folders. I was apalled at the UI and it completely messed up. 

I'd recommend Nekogram, if you want. Works well with some additional features. Catgoram is also interesting. Super nice! Thank you guys and OP"

How Long Are Messages Stored On The Server?;7;kyzz59;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kyzz59/how_long_are_messages_stored_on_the_server/;10;"I searched through the Privacy Policy as well as both FAQs on Telegram’s website and could not find this answer. 

If I’m in a cloud-chat with someone and I delete the convo for both parties, how long does Telegram keep that chat data in their servers? It’s super sketchy to me that they don’t disclose this. Most services do. 

Also tried reaching out to telegram and still haven’t heard back about this. 

Curious if Secret Chat data is ever cleared from their servers too even though it’s totally encrypted. 

If you work for telegram, let me know because with so many people flocking to Telegram now, data privacy is a huge issue.

Cheers";2021-01-17 08:07:36;"Until you stop using telegram or delete those messages manually. If you don't trust it, just use secret chats. Here's some [relevant information](https://telegram.org/privacy#10-2-messages) from the privacy policy:

> In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants. Note that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.

and;

> In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending. Otherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history. This means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history. As soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.

It's impossible to tell for sure however. I have noticed that bots can access media that have been sent to them long after the original message has been deleted, and I believe this was the case in the past for normal users until they changed the API to also require a reference to a valid (non-deleted) message that you have permission to see before you can download a file by its ID. I assume either Telegram keep media forever, or they do garbage collection after a very long time. I understand, but I meant like totally deleting the chat. Like I’m done talking to my friend, so I swipe to delete the whole chat for me and for my friend. It then deletes from my phone and his, that’s great. But I just couldn’t find any info on how long that chat is still actually in telegram’s servers which worried me. Valid point, but even for secret chats I’m curious how long they hold the messages. I know they’re fully E2EE but still, if they’re holding onto stuff for extended periods, that’s not cool! I’m sure they’re probably not. But I just wish they were transparent about it. Thanks! This does help. Though I don’t think the second part is relevant to people on 5.5 and higher. From what I understand, anyone can now delete anything regardless of the 48 hour time limit which used to be in place. What you pasted below actually insinuates that telegram immediately removes the info from their server which would be ideal. Just wish they were a bit more “forward” and upfront about the exact timing. Maybe it’s once a week or something which is totally reasonable. Yeah i kmow what you meant, they say they will delete them on server after you deleted them on your device. But there is no way to be sure. Then you need some P2P app like Tox, Jitsi or Jami. And there is a known issue with secret chats where some messages may stay even if the set time is gone."

And every time he told me that he doesn’t know who are these girls and how they are in his contact list. 
Please help. Can this happen that he doesn’t know who they are or lying to me again?";2021-01-17 06:56:26;"It might be possible, but not likely. I set up my mother's phone with my Google account, so her contacts would sync to my Google account and onto my phone, where Telegram would pick them up and add unknown people to my contacts. 

Eventually set her up with her own Google account and removed the people I don't know. Yes, what they say about the Gmail account could be possible, that is happening to me... I don't have a lot of contacts in my current cellphone, but now I am looking a lot of people on Telegram that I used to have in my other cell (same google account)... So, now I have those people on telegram, but they are not in my cellphone contacts. 
There's an option on the cell where you choose what contacts to see, and I checked my Gmail account and I could see all that people, the bad thing is I couldn't erase them cos it said something about ""read only"", and honestly I haven't searched how to ""fix it"". Yes, it happens. Numbers are re-owned by people who changes it, that numbers could be unknown people. And you can confirm it if there's guys names that he also doesn't recognize.

Comment aside, live your life, trust people or leave it, and stop snooping on your partner phone, that's fking disgusting. If he is a active group user (which means he likes to chat on different public groups), there will be some advertising messages from unknown accounts. However this may not be the case because advertising account will not appear in contacts unless you manually add them them (you won't be able to see their phone number if they don't share with you, which is rare). So if you find unfamiliar users on chat list or block list, it is normal, however you should becareful if they're in contact list.

For Google account (and other accounts) syncing issue, if he's using iPhone then you can check all contacts accounts linked to iPhone on Settings App -> Contacts -> Accounts, you can also view all contacts by account in Contacts App -> Groups. In his phone its only his google account"

I think by design they are mobile to mobile only for security reasons (screenshot detection IIRC, guaranteed deletion, etc) but I could be wrong.  For me, their normal chats are more than secure. The any data you send is encrypted before it hits the telegram servers. I use https://desktop.telegram.org  it’s one of the main supported clients and has builds for 32-bit and 64-bit Linux.  (Both work in i386 and amd64 Debian buster) Just download, extract and run.  (Pro tip: choose a location you’d like to keep the binary before running for the first time.  Personally I create a ~/software directory I then exact telegram into, but you could easily use /opt.  Once you run it the first time, it creates .desktop entries and integrates into your applications menu for easy access).

Oops- didn’t read your entire message: see this for more info - good comments from fellow redditors https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kyoe4t/q_why_doesnt_telegram_make_the_secrets_chats/ The screenshot excuse was mentioned but phones can screenshot too and it's the user's responsibility to protect physical access to their PCs anyways.

If it's hidden, they can't.

I am not sure, but maybe it is possible with bots. There is no way to track that if those users turned that off. If one really wanted to, they could create a client that scrapes that information, but they would first have to know your phone number.  For me, I often just leave telegram on my computer always on so to my friends they see me as always online and can’t really tell from my telegram status that I sleep 🤪 No?

Private groups;6;kyqy18;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kyqy18/private_groups/;12;I have a private group and have invited a lot of people, but many don’t show up under the members list, but I don’t see any notification that any of them have left, either. For example, ten people are shown to have joined the group, but group membership only goes up by two or three members. The app doesn’t seem to show them leaving the group like it should. What could be going on?;2021-01-16 23:41:28;If they are set as admins and option ”remain anonymous” is on for those specific members, they don’t add to the total member count of the group. I don’t know if this is a bug or not but I noticed it myself when I was testing settings. Some user changed their privacy settings to not allow non contacts to add them into groups, you should receive an error toast if you add them into your group. If you want to invite them into a group, send them a message separately or request them to add you into their contacts. These members that have joined have not been set as Admins, though. They are just regular members. Well this is strange then. No clue to be honest, unfortunately. Telegram will show some members joining, like “hevvymetl has joined the group via invite link” but then not appear in the members list. There is no notification saying “hevvymetl has left the group” like there should be if a member has left. Actually now that I think more, I’m not sure if there are such notifications in groups in telegram (if someone leaves). But the group I created used to show when somebody left. It’s just been the past few days this has started happening If you have accidentally made the group public or have changed it to supergroup (by toggling that new members can see previous messages before their joining date). For example, I’m in a old public group of 200+ people that is currently unused. For certain someone has left at some point, but there are no notifications. This is all speculation, though. Im not sure how this all works. That could be the problem, then, or at least an explanation. I set my group’s chat history as visible for new members, but my group is still private. Yeah that could explain. AFAIK changing it back to disabled would not revert the group type back (from supergroup). Also something worth noting is that you can actually delete groups and chat history from all devices & server as an admin if they are supergroups. This is not possible (for some reason) for normal groups (default settings with chat history kept unchanged). This is interesting. What's the simplest way to tell if a group is a supergroup or not? I don’t know what is the simplest, but if you are owner of the group there is delete option for supergroups and ”leave” for normal groups. I bet there are more simple ways, though.

[Q] Why doesn't Telegram make the Secrets Chats option more obvious to the new user for E2EE, and why are they unavailable in the web and desktop apps?;47;kyoe4t;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kyoe4t/q_why_doesnt_telegram_make_the_secrets_chats/;92;"If the web and desktop apps don't support them, then how's Telegram any better than WhatsApp? The whole privacy community lowkey hates Telegram and endorses Signal. Even Snowden. Gotta admit that that UI is beautiful, though, but it's all misleading. I don't think people care so much about backups; the Telegram dev's article from years ago says that's the reason it doesn't use E2EE by default and that people need to stop 'fearmongering' and spreading FUD, but I think they have a point. The 'excuse' that people can take screenshots on desktop is BS IMO because you can do the same on a phone, and it's the user's responsibility to keep their stuff physically secure, anyways. P.S. I'm on Debian Linux.";2021-01-16 21:32:03;"[deleted] I wouldn’t use Telegram as main messaging app  if it would offer only e2e chats. I heavily use Telegram, I need history and search. Its not possible with e2e.

Now let’s go through:

1. Desktop client on Macs has Secret Chats. I as know Windows considered insecure to have SC. 
2. Telegram is better than WhatsApp because... lol. Let’s begin and stop on this: WA isn’t open source.
3. Whole Signal offers only one part of Telegram: secret chats. Don’t forget, Telegram is also somehow social network, there is channels that are very popular in many countries and offers uncensored media space. Signal’s worst part is that it completely American: founded, located, financed, servers based in USA. The country where CIA and NSA do what they want with your privacy. Where there is no free speech. I used Signal before. Damn it was so boring. Also your phone number is EXPOSED on Signal..so? Privacy sucks. Telegram offers both: security and privacy + convenience if you wanna add that. Want e2ee? Damn just start a secret chat. 

Although for groups, Idk how it will be possible to make it E2EE as this is out of my scope. There *are* secret chats on the Mac OS desktop  Security is just an illusion oo ...everything can be hacked. 

Use Unigram  in Microsoft Store to access the Secret Chat(SC)  for Telegram Desktop. It's simple. Signal is willing to do the work to build out features while preserving privacy. Telegram wants to add features first and then see how they can maximize privacy.

People in this sub have a hard-on for anything that's not Facebook and _trust_ anything that's not Facebook. But the point is that Telegram has the _capability_ to read your (non-secret-chat) messages and you have to trust that they won't. Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong. The point is that both Signal and Telegram are making different trade-offs.

Personally, I will never trust a non-e2e encrypted messaging platform again. So it's Signal all the way for me. But I also don't have groups with thousands of members, so there's that. IMAO backups is not the point, the seamless multi-device experience is. Yes, you're right, back in 2017, Pavel Durov, Telegram's CEO published a post explaining why they are not E2EE by default. I was naive enough to fall for it. But it is full of deception and weasel words which most companies are guilty of to mislead their customers. u/maqp who is a cryptographer published [a long post](https://graph.org/Why-you-should-stop-reading-Durovs-blog-posts-11-25) completely debunking Telegram's claims and exposing their deception. It was very enlightening for me. I highly recommend you read it.   


Thankfully some Tech reporters are [correcting the misinformation](https://mashable.com/article/telegram-whatsapp-signal-end-to-end-encryption-e2e/) about Telegram's security when it comes to privacy but I fear it's not enough.   


The way I see it, Telegram doesn't implement E2EE by default because it's in their interest not to.  Implementing all their features via E2EE is a lot of work that Telegram is simply not willing to do. >Telegram is secured. Your data is safe.

I won't agree, because it's not 100% truth. Nothing is secured and data can't be safe anywhere, even on paper. And just because something's 'not owned by Fb' doesn't automatically mean it's a saint. There's Google and the NSA that are also demons. Also, saying e2ee is overkill for basic chatting is like saying having a free speech amendment is overkill since most people have 'nothing to say'. Misleading people into thinking an app's 'encrypted' when it BY DEFAULT is not (the way they'd think it'd be), and they don't even put a message in their faces about it, then that's really sketchy. But why would people need cloud other than for backups, which I personally don't see a reason for, unless your chats occasionally have stuff you want to keep that you can just back up separately? And how can we know that any data's safe when the company has the keys and if anyone discovers a zero-day or even does social engineering on an exhausted employee then boom, data breach? telegram will need to make money. 

and they can easily sell your data to facebook in the future. 

or hell, facebook could just buy telegram WhatsApp and Signal can use search and history. Not sure why you try to imply otherwise for E2EE messengers. Right, but the Linux client doesn't have SC, and Linux is practically as privacy-friendly as you can get, so they should probably have added it. American: yea that's a point I don't like much, but tbf, Uncle Sam can fuck with anyone in any country: it imprisoned Assange who's not even American, fucked with thepiratebay, Kim Dotcom (also not American), etc.

The whole staying away from the five/nine/fourteen eyes can feel good on the surface level but America pretty controls the world's internet, and if not that then it can bully anyone into extraditing anyone it deems a threat to its power. I guess if you need group functionality then there's not much other option. Signal has history and search, so not sure what you're saying there. You didn't even answer OP's question. 

1. Telegram Desktop for Mac supports secrets chat? Which one? The one from their website or the one from the Mac app store? Because both don't support secret chats. 
2. Telegram is not completely open source. And even if that were true, I can't believe you would cite that as the primary reason to persuade anyone to choose over WA. The fact is WA is E2EE by default Telegram is not. Yes there WA has a loophole through backups which are not E2EE. That doesn't change the fact that Telegram doesn't have E2EE by default. No matter what is wrong with WA and Facebook, it doesn't change the inescapable fact that Telegram is not E2EE by default. 
3. That is just a blatant lie. Are you serious? E2EE is the only feature that Signal shares with Telegram? On Signal everything is E2EE not just messages, but emojis, gifs, stickers, and all your metadata. That is not the case for Telegram. Even in Secret Chats, gifs, stickers, and emojis are not E2EE, and neither is our metadata. Signal has E2EE audio and video calls, as well as groups chats.  Signal is also completely open source. Signal may be based in the US but they have been tested by the highest courts and intelligence agencies, and earned their users trust by providing zero data because it's E2EE by default. Can Telegram say the same? I trust [the word or Edward Snowden](https://nitter.net/Snowden/status/947216112428769280) over Pavel Durov's. Signal offers E2EE group videoconferencing on multiple devices

Does telegram already offer videoconferencing? How was it 'so boring'? Then why not on the Linux one? I'm on Linux. I think you're overdoing it, E2EE doesn't fit with Telegram's architecture and secret chat isn't available everywhere because it's obviously encrypted. Think about it A pro-telegrammer just pointed out how Telegram hides your number and Signal doesn't; do you know why? True, but going for even just a 5-mile run is better than sitting on the couch. [deleted] True multi-device. Each client is a full client, independent of all others. I run telegram on two phones, a tablet and my PC. Any message to me hits all of them. Any file I upload from one is available on all of them. They all instantly update whenever another changes something. 

Whatsapp and I presume signal use a fake desktop system that piggybacks off your phone's connection. Only one client. Unacceptable. [deleted] Speculation Honestly, same with Signal. Linux user here, your chats are saved in $HOME and theoretically every program that you run even without sudo has access to them America couldn't even extradite Julian Assange I guess they want to stop the following:
1. A user creates a SC on desktop to any user.
2. The user modifies the opensource desktop client to export SC as well.
3. The user exports the SC and the data is not in the other users controll anymore.

I guess thats the same reasony why they dont add chat export on mobile. It would be to easy to make them export SC aswell. If emojis, gifs and stickers were e2e then they probably wouldn't be syncable, and that's the main reason I use Telegram: that everything works so seamlessly and synchronized. That when I join a group, I can see the entire chat history if the admin allows it. And so many other things.
The thing is Telegram can be a very casual and full of features app for people that don't care about privacy, who chat only with friends and family and are in casual groups like university related or gaming groups; but at the same time, for people who really care about security, it has options to have almost Signal-like privacy at the cost of a lot of features most people use Telegram for.
Telegram never claimed to be the most secure messenger, its only fight on security was with Whatsapp and you can't deny the fact that it is more secure than Whatsapp.
Maybe now that they have won the fight, they can add some security features from Signal like their extra-secure e2e GROUP chats, but again, I'd like them to do it the Telegram way and have it as an extra option.

Edit: btw there's sth else Telegram offers that Signal and Whatsapp don't and that is anonymity, finding users based on just their handle @ to talk to and joining groups without sharing your phone number and that is another big plus that no one talks about. Unfortunately, Signal is as open source as Telegram at this point: the server-side code on GitHub hasn't seen an update for *9 months*. > Because both don't support secret chats. 

Mac App Store supports it. WA is E2EE, meanwhile they use messages data for advertising and phone carriers have acces to WA messages. 1. ""Telegram"" app not Desktop nor lite. Both store and website Only user-to-user, but yes. https://telegram.org/blog/video-calls Group video calls are coming soon. Yes, it does The UI. You can’t really do a lot of customization. No channels. No great bots. The question is more why is the mac one different than the other desktop platform clients Third time you said this. Maybe include it on the original text. Lol. You're not making any sense. Please elaborate. Overdoing it how? 

> *secret chat isn't available everywhere because it's obviously encrypted. Think about it* 

What does that even mean?! No why? Enlighten me. 

Telegram hides your number? Once again, this is not by default. You have to choose to use a username and most users don't. 

Also the username is to hide your number from other users NOT Telegram. 

To sign up to Telegram you still need to give them your number. Same as Signal.

The difference is there literally the only single piece of information Signs collects about you whereas Telegram collects everything else by default, you messages, all the photos and docs you share, your contacts,  and all the metadata that does with it.. Then why doesn't it explicitly say that it has an e2e feature the first time it opens, especially after all this controversy? If they're lucky, a new user will hit the compose button and become curious about the 'secret chat' feature. When you hit menu, there's no 'start secret chat'. Hit contacts, nothing. Only if you hit compose.

So hidden it really seems suspicious, and not everyone's going to go through the whole FAQ to the privacy section and just then see that secret chats are a feature, not to mention that neither the Windows (I think) nor Linux desktop clients have them, and since many prefer texting on their PCs than on tiny phones, they're discouraging the use of e2e. Also, the burden of proof is on you when you say that client-server encryption is as good as e2e, not me. It seems more like you don't want to confront truth than that you don't want to debate. You can't do that with Signal? I run the same Signal on phone and desktop and everything syncs fine; not sure about more than that though. Fine, though I use S on multiple devices and everything syncs fine. Phone can be off; doesn't matter. sure but this is just plain facts. 

telegram can sell your data. 

signal cannot. except telegram has your chats. 

signal doesnt. 

the beauty of true e2ee Doesn't Telegram store them like that too? If you don't trust your programs, sandbox them. This is a _terrible_ argument. But he's still locked up in the UK. But they say the Mac client has SC. >*it has options to have almost Signal-like privacy at the cost of a lot of features most people use Telegram for.*

Telegram is not E2EE by default and most Telegram users don't use Secret Chats. And for the tiny minority that do, I'm willing to be they don't use it often or regularly. 

All this is to say that if you love Telegram that's fine, but they should stop promoting themselves as a service that values and protects privacy. And their users should stop too. 

Literally every internet service claims they value and protect your privacy. Podcast apps say that too, yet it's obvious that all podcast app developers seek to know more about your tastes, what kind of content you  listen too, how often, for how long, etc...and they'd love to link that information to other data available about you online. 

&#x200B;

>  *Telegram never claimed to be the most secure messenger, its only fight on security was with Whatsapp*  

That is a load of BS. Yes, WhatsApp is their main competitor but by positioning themselves as privacy protectors, they are effectively openly competing with all apps claiming the same position, the top one being Signal. Plus Telegram has named Signal numerous times in blogs and tweets. 

No messaging app as far as I know has claimed to be the most secure messaging app, including Signal. But numerous apps have positioned themselves as protectors of privacy. If you're gonna compete in that lane, of course people are gonna want to verify and challenge your claims. 

&#x200B;

> *you can't deny the fact that it is more secure than Whatsapp.*  

ROFL! I know a lot of heavy Telegram users who would beg to differ. 

**FACT: Neither Telegram nor WhatsApp are truly private.** 

WA is E2EE by default but backups are not E2EE and most WA users have backups enabled. 

Telegram is NOT E2EE by default and most users do not use secrets chats. 

You could defend the claim that Telegram's Secret Chats are more secure than WhatsApp's E2EE. But if most users don't use Secret Chats they might as well stick with WA.   


The only thing that makes WhatsApp less trustworthy than Telegram, is the fact that they are owned by FB, one of the biggest data mining companies in the world.   
That doesn't automatically make Telegram earn our trust. 

If your last boyfriend was a serial rapist, simply not being one does not automatically make every potential suitor worthy of dating you. ???????? Care to share evidence of those claims? 

And what exactly is your point ? WA  = bad? I don't think anyone here disagrees with that. Any ELI5? MAS version is made from SwiftUI and data stay in a sandbox, cannot be exposed. I'm saying that Telegram stores messages on server for convenience and with E2EE it won't be possible to do that, since secret chats are encrypted they cannot be used through server, the reason Telegram doesn't have the encryption on by default is for this very same reason Example: when you link a new device on Signal, your chat history is not synced, only new messages from that point on. Signal can and will if US Government asks them for their data, their servers are stored in USA.
They can give all your contacts, your contact info to their government. Even NSA is funding it. Bbbut at least it's not owned by Fb and they (say they) don't share our data! /s What do you mean? You are *terrible* argument. Telegram is adapting to its weakest users, not strongest is it possible to install apps from app store on mac which are not basically desktop apps? Have a look for yourself: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server. We also know the production Signal server is running a later closed-source version of the code since a few features are missing from the released codebase. From what I remember the Linux and windows clients were the same but mac had 2 official clients, one which had the secret chat feature. I might be wrong, maybe there's only one and it has secret chat.. someone I'm sure can correct any mistakes I made here  I'm not convinced that's true. E2EE cloud services exists: Mega, [Sync.com](https://Sync.com), Tresorit, and soon ProtonDrive, so the idea that it's not possible to store in the cloud while being E2EE is not true. It's just harder but Telegram doesn't want to do that. 

*Convenience.* You make it sound like that's a good thing in the context of privacy and security. It's not.   


To quote [Edward Snowden](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/947216112428769280?s=20):

>*Telegram still seems to encourage dangerous cloud messaging instead of secret chats. Experts ask ""why?"" And the answer is ""convenience."" That's unsafe.* Yea, that's for privacy reasons. If you truly care about privacy you wouldn't care about any backup feature too. No one needs to backup their cat picture memes; they exist everywhere online. There's a big difference between the NSA getting your contacts, and the NSA getting your messages.

You're either stupid or pretending you don't understand the difference. Encrypted chat history with key stored somewhere in plaintext. Careful with ad-hominems. Your point is valid for secret data like GPG and SSH keys and private data like tax returns and emails. Should you not use local programs for anything, since any program under your user can access those files? Not to mention: what you are saying is **also** true for macOS and Windows as well. What else would they be? Web wrappers? Is that right? That must be why Signal's protocol is used by other services like WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, and Telegram's is not. Since I don't have much expertise in this field I cannot say much but yeah Telegram did pick this path, I have to study on this subject first. Recently an idiot Indian journalist's whatsapp chat history was leaked and most of chats were decrypted using brute force and so many out of context symbols were lying throughout the leak. So I'm currently under various doubts. E2E breaks seamless sync between devices. E2E is there when you really need it. No. Telegram doesn't store msg in your computer Oh then they just don't bother Yes it is. There are multiple threads and GitHub issues on the topic.

Can you develop that thought? I don't understand the connection you're making. I want to make it clear once again that I am not saying WA is good on privacy. They're not good at it. Every time Telegram is criticized on privacy they and their users point to WA being bad. That's deflection. You have to address the claims made about your service. It's the case for any app. 

If I accused you of being a thief, your defense can't be ""my neighbor's a rapist"". Regardless of if the latter is true or not it doesn't disprove the accusations against you, which you haven't addressed at all 

That being said if your phone is unlocked or had weak or no security then of course it's easy to read your WA messages, even if they are E2EE. Same for your Telegram messages, or your Signal messages. 

Do you know the details of how it was hacked? Its also possible that this journalist backed his WA messages to the cloud, in which case they were no longer E2EE.

Another possibility is that the people who were communicating with him were hacked, and that's how they got to the journalist. Even if you use secret chats? Exactly. They don't want to do the work (backend + UI + scaling) to make it possible because they just don't care. I am suggesting that popular and successful open source apps usually get forked ie used to develop other apps. Eg: Signal's protocol is used by WhatsApp, FB Messenger & Skype.

Firefox web browser which is open source has been forked by many developers, WaterFox is one example. 

Finally, Chromium, the open source web browser on which Google Chrome is based has been used to develop many other browsers including: Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, Microsoft Edge, etc...

Meanwhile Telegram's protocol which is allegedly open source and a very popular app, has been used  by no one other than Telegram.

There is no app we know of that is based on Telegram's code, and has been used to develop other communication apps unrelated to Telegram. 

Hence why I believe Telegram is not completely open source as I have seen various people in the tech community day. 

And I don't understand your claim about Signal. You seem to suggest that because the code hasn't been updated in 9 months it's not open source. Is that what you are saying? Thanks for your input. Please check out my last post on the Signal sub regarding Signal. Wait I just saw you commented. secret chats gets deleted automatically once you end the session. You need to take a hard break from this because you have misunderstood the entire premise of open source, what it means to be open source, and throwing in some frankly wild conjecture mixed in with a little bit of conspiracy theory.

Let me start with the most straightforward: the server that Signal the corporation is running is *by definition* not open source because the version it is running is significantly newer than what is available to the public. If the codebase for what you are running is not available to the public you are running closed source software. Now, Signal will likely push an update to the repos eventually but this is a very, very bad example to set for a project that has historically leaned on its open source bona fides for goodwill.

Now for your other claims/conjecture: no one who actually knows what they're talking about in this space says that Telegram in its entirety is open source. Telegram, the corporation, specifically addresses this in its FAQ. The server code is not open source. It never was. The client code, that is, what runs on your phone is completely open source. 

I want to break this up a bit because you also seem to be conflating a protocol, which can be publicly *documented* not open sourced in the conventional use of the term, with the Telegram app. MTProto 2, the Telegram encryption protocol, is *fully documented* just like the Signal Protocol. Anyone may freely use it.

There are many Telegram apps written by indie developers, such as Unigram and Telegram X. Signal, on the other hand, has few, because Moxie specifically disallows third party apps from connecting to the Signal servers.

If you're going to argue on the internet about computing things, please please do your research to a level where you superficially understand the technical language used. This may come off as insulting to you but you need to understand that when you argue without full comprehension you *damage* the reputation of projects and spread misinformation that others then repeat around the internet. This is awful practice in a globalized world, where misunderstandings lead to very bad outcomes. What if you never end it because it's what you normally use? Clearly you have more technical knowledge than I do. It is my understanding that Telegram X is ran by Telegram developers with the involvement of Durov, which is why I don't count it as an independent fork, the way Brave & Opera are completely independent from Google developers. I don't know about Unigram but I'll have to check into it. 

If what you're saying about Signal is true, are you suggesting that because of that Telegram is more secure than there are in the context of privacy? There's a bunch of other Telegram forks I'm missing. I prefer the official just because I like having all the latest features.

No, I'm definitely not saying Telegram is more secure. It's my choice of app but that's more to do with enjoying all the features Telegram has over Signal than security. There's room for both apps in this ecosystem. 

Signal still guarantees end to end encryption between clients on all chats. That's a benefit to very many people. Durov has chosen to make Secret Chats (E2EE) an opt-in feature. In exchange we get cloud chats, infinite independent active chat clients across desktop and mobile, and other conveniences.

You can't have a perfect security posture and all of the features. But I will say that thus far Durov has done a commendable job protecting Belorussian, Russian, and Hong Kong protestors.

Everything is a trade-off. What I want to impress is is not to choose tribalism and shitting on the Signal or Telegram people. Either choice is a choice of safety from the surveillance adtech megafirms of the world. Of course there is room for all apps in the ecosystem. Nobody is saying otherwise. If there is more than one reliable secure messaging app that's fantastic! 

I just think it's important for users to be informed about the the level of privacy and security they get with each app. Every app has weaknesses, and they need to be open about it. 

My issue is that so many Telegram users wrongly believe that they have privacy in cloud chats when they don't. The reason  they believe that is because Telegram misleads them into believing so, which is what bothers me the most. It's one of those situations where the cover up is worse than the crime. 

I absolutely hate it when companies mislead their customers with deceptive language. So many companies are guilty of this, including Apple, Facebook/WhatsApp, and Telegram too. 

Apple wants to be held as this beacon of privacy, and to be fair, they have taken a lot of steps in the right direction to protect their users privacy. However, they mislead their users into a false sense of security, by allowing them to believe they have privacy when they don't. 

iMessages are E2EE by default, but not when they are backed up to iCloud which is also enabled by default. 

Similarly Telegram wants to be held as this beacon of privacy, and that's my problem. If they did not market themselves as private I would have far less of an issue with them. 

GMail doesn't pretend you have privacy from Google. They don't market themselves that way. It would be extremely egregious if they did. They are not ProtonMail or Tutanota which are E2EE email services. 

To me Telegram is very much like Discord. They have a lot of great features but users have little to no privacy on it. 

I'm not sure I agree with you that Durov has done the best job protecting Hong Kong protesters, or protesters from other countries. After all, [the Chinese government was able to exploit weaknesses in Telegram to identify protesters.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/08/25/chinese-agencies-crack-telegram-a-timely-warning-for-end-to-end-encryption/?sh=5a2240a36342) 

And when you read Telegram's defence, it contains deflection and weasel words: 

&#x200B;

>*""handling of phone numbers in groups is already more private than on other mass-market messengers""*

Why do they say *""other mass-market messengers""*? Why don't they name them if they are so popular?  Are they referring to Signal? WhatsApp? 

Telegram doesn't name them because they know they are not more secure than Signal and other similar apps but by saying *""other mass-market messengers"",* by being vague, they mislead the public into thinking they are. 

And if they are ever accused of claiming that, they can weasel out of it by saying ""*we never said we were more secure than Signal or x app"".*

That's misleading. It's the kind of thing politicians and lawyers do. 

If you say *I'm a better tennis player than many other great players out there*, it doesn't have the same ring as saying, *I'm a better tennis player than Federer, Nadal, & Djokovic.*

Moreover, I don't like that often when Telegram is criticised, instead of addressing the criticism head on, they point to competitors who are just as bad or worse. They never seems to want to admit fault. They point to worse services as if they don't have competitors who offer better security and privacy than them.

At the end of the day I trust the experts in the infosec community, when they say that Telegram is not secure when it comes to privacy. 

Personally, I think it's extremely dangerous for protesters, journalists and whistle blowers to use Telegram. And by bragging that people from those communities use Telegram, Telegram is encouraging others to do the same which is extremely irresponsible, especially if their communication is not secure. I honestly that they will eventually get some people killed. I wholeheartedly agree with Edward Snowden when [he spoke on this.](https://nitter.net/Snowden/status/947205295540928518#m)

It just dawned on me that another reason why Telegram doesn't want E2EE in group chats or public channels, is because it's a potential revenue stream. After all they just announced that they were going to start charging for some features and potentially introduce ads in public channels. 

WhatsApp recently clarified that their new privacy policy applies to business chats only, ie chats we have with businesses. I don't believe them, but even if it were true I could see Telegram's trajectory being similar. 

I don't fault Telegram for wanting to make money. It's the *how* that matters to me., and I don't find Telegram to be a very transparent company. 

You have a lot of technical knowledge, have you read this [**cryptographer's rebuttal**](https://graph.org/Why-you-should-stop-reading-Durovs-blog-posts-11-25)'s to Telegram's defence for not having E2EE by default? It's very enlightening. If you do read it, please read it in its entirety before you comment on it. > My issue is that so many Telegram users wrongly believe that they have privacy in cloud chats when they don't. The reason they believe that is because Telegram misleads them into believing so, which is what bothers me the most. It's one of those situations where the cover up is worse than the crime.

But they do have privacy. They just don't have privacy in the way *you* want them to have privacy. More than a few nation states have tried to ban, infiltrate or shut down Telegram. If cloud chats weren't private, there would be no reason to.

> I'm not sure I agree with you that Durov has done the best job protecting Hong Kong protesters, or protesters from other countries. After all, the Chinese government was able to exploit weaknesses in Telegram to identify protesters.

Telegram swiftly rolled out features shortly after this was discovered to prevent this loophole from being exploited. The fact that you didn't disclose this makes it sound like you are the one being disingenuous, not Telegram.

> It just dawned on me that another reason why Telegram doesn't want E2EE in group chats or public channels, is because it's a potential revenue stream. After all they just announced that they were going to start charging for some features and potentially introduce ads in public channels.

Telegram is working on Secret Chats for groups.

Whoever this cryptographer is makes very few arguments attacking the *cryptography of Telegram*. This person is not a software engineer so why would I trust what they have to say about Telegram's software architecture? Within the first few paragraphs it also elides to Durov potentially being trained by intelligence agencies.

If this is the kind of articles you read, I don't know what to say to you. You seem to have an axe to grind on anything not E2EE. Please stop treating this as a war where it's a moral imperative to keep people away from anything not Signal. >*But they do have privacy. They just don't have privacy in the way you want them to have privacy. More than a few nation states have tried to ban, infiltrate or shut down Telegram. If cloud chats weren't private, there would be no reason to.* 

Are you deliberately not understanding what I am saying? Most Telegram users do not have privacy from Telegram. All those protestors you claim Telegram protects, they don't have privacy from Telegram. Telegram can't criticize Facebook/WhatsApp for being able to read their users message when they can do the same.   


> *Telegram swiftly rolled out features shortly after this was discovered to prevent this loophole from being exploited. The fact that you didn't disclose this makes it sound like you are the one being disingenuous, not Telegram.* 

The fact that I didn't disclose this? Dude. It's in the article. Did you not read it. And I don't see how your point. The point of the story is that the damage was done because of a preventable and foreseeable weakness. Yes, it's good that Telegram fixed it but take some responsibility. Own your mistakes. Fixing it with out owning the mistake, by pointing the finger at others, is not taking full responsibility.    


>*Whoever this cryptographer is makes very few arguments attacking the cryptography of Telegram. This person is not a software engineer so why would I trust what they have to say about Telegram's software architecture?*  

Did you even read it? In full? Does the character of Durov or any company leader whose service you use not matter? You're not bothered by the deliberate misleading? Wow. Ok.   


>*Please stop treating this as a war where it's a moral imperative to keep people away from anything not Signal.* 

Clearly you haven't read the article. Did I say or suggest I was against anything not Signal? The infosec community recommends plenty of apps that are not Signal, and they have their legitimate criticisms of Signal and other apps.   


If there is one thing that I absolutely hate is when people try to have a conversation and they don't listen to each other. If you're gonna criticize article you haven't read in full, I don't see what's the point. You think I hate Telegram, you do realize I use it right? I thought I made that clear. But I guess I can't criticize it. Ok..."
Telegram Privacy;16;kynyum;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kynyum/telegram_privacy/;35;"I know this post might ruffle some feathers here in the subreddit, but I believe this is an issue that needs to be addressed and communicated more clearly with the wider audience.

What I am talking about is how Telegram encrypts your messages, or how it does not. I have been a user of Telegram for 5 years now, and just now (since this Whatsapp fiasco started) did I learn that Telegram does not encrypt regular chats using End-to-End Encryption and only uses End-to-End Encryption in Secret Chats.

And while I blame myself for not looking into it prior, I think the way Telegram is pitched in the open-source and privacy circles is partially responsible for my lack of knowledge.  
This is especially important when Telegram is pitched as a more privacy-focused alternative to Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger, whereas if you are not using Secret Chats then Whatsapp Chats are in fact more secure and private.  
This is not meant as a dig on Telegram, I still love the app, I just think it would be a lot better if this is communicated in a more clear way to new and old users alike. 

Ofcourse ideally Telegram would implement End-to-End Encryption in all chats, although I understand that that would interfere with their cloud storage features so I am not holding my breath for that.

TL;DR I think new users and old ones alike should know that Unlike Whatsapp, Telegram does not use End-to-End Encryption in regular chats only in Secret Chats.";2021-01-16 21:10:50;"Also normal messages are encrypted. They're just encrypted sender to server then server to receiver. It's not like they're sent in plain text. This is a subject people often does not understand. I will try to explain a couple of things people need to know about E2E encryption.

1. When it comes to encryption there are ""keys"" involved in the process. Keys in Signal are stored in the device, for example. The same goes with Secret Chats in Telegram. So, a user sends a message that is meant to be received and decrypted only with your key. That means that only you can decrypt the message sent to you. For the process to be E2E encrypted only you own and can use your key and the key must be in your device because E2E encryption means that the message/data is encrypted before leaving device A and is only decrypted in device B. Messages and data will go through a server but the server will only see some random encrypted data and cannot see the content. Why does Cloud Chats are not E2E encrypted? Because the keys used to decrypt your data are in their servers and not in your device. The data is still encrypted but the keys are not stored on your device, they're stored in Telegram's server because that's the only way you can have cross-platform sync across devices because if the keys were not stored in their servers then for you to decrypt the data in every device you would need to export and import the keys manually between devices. All chats in Telegram are encrypted but the encryption method of secret chats are different from the cloud chats. People consider cloud chats insecure because in theory Telegram owners can decrypt your data and everything you have in your chats. E2E encryption is not easy and it will not be easy to manage when you're storing data in a cloud service and when the user is not tech savvy. That's why you have cloud chats and secret chats. That's why secret chats can only be opened in the device of origin and cannot, and will not be never synchronized across devices. Signal can sync the conversations but in terms of security, not being able to sync your secret chats is much more secure.

2. WhatsApp is not secure at all even when they're using their own version of the Signal Protocol to encrypt messages. Why you can't say they're more secure than Telegram's cloud chats? Because their whole code is closed source. Unlike Telegram, WhatsApp is closed source and that means no one can see what's in their code. If you can't see the code of a product then you can't possibly know what's really doing the app. They use their own version of the Signal Protocol, which is open source, but due to the platform being closed source we can't possible know if they implemented a backdoor in their app so they can see the messages. So when an app is closed source we should assume that there is a high risk of a backdoor in the app. It's not always true but if you're looking for privacy, open source is always your best bet because there will always be people who can review what's really doing the app. Telegram app is open source and if there were any backdoor in their code, believe me, we would know. So no, because and app is telling you that they're using E2E encryption does not means it's secure to use it. In any case, assuming WA have backdoors then the app is much less secure than Telegram's cloud chats. At least Telegram can be audited, reviewed because it's open source. You can't do that in WA and because we're looking for privacy, we should assume the worst (the worst being that WA have backdoors). 

People are trashing Telegram because the cloud chats are not E2E encrypted but then the same people tells you to use Apple and iMessage. Apple hold the keys for your chats in their servers so you can sync messages across devices, which it's basically the same as Telegram cloud messages. People tells you comments like: ""sure, Telegram says is encrypted but they own your confidential information"". So... you're telling me you're sending emails using Google, totally unencrypted, every day with confidential attachments such as W-2 forms, taxes, ID's, etc., but you're concerned about a messaging app? And even worst, we store really confidential information, backups (btw, every backup made by WA is unencrypted... so if someone gains access to a WA backup then they can see everything in your chats without any encryption at all) and even nudes in cloud storage without any encryption at all (Google Drive, for example). 

I recommend you to lookup any article explaining how OpenPGP works, just so you can see how data is encrypted and have an overview on how encryption works. Maybe you can try to use OpenPGP for some email address and for testing purposes so you can also see how an encrypted message looks like and how to manage encryption keys so you can understand better my point #1. The thing is normal chats are server side encrypted (so no plain text transfer) so that you have the luxury to have synchronized chats across multiple devices. 


Secret chats are for exactly those reasons: secrets .
You always have the choice what chats you nobody wanr to know.
Imo they do a good job in clearify that difference. And that's also a big difference to WA.
I don't want all chats to be e2e encrypted because I want synchronized chats and files.


And i want to clearify: there is NO secure multi client e2e encryption because of obvious reasons.


Imo people need to be more aware what ""type"" of conversation they want, that way people learn to differentiate what data is more private than other. Regular chats should not be e2e encrypted. We will lose history even on app reinstall, let alone phone change and loss.
It’s a best model to have both kinds of chats.

WhatsApp’s e2e is fake, Signal is only e2e and Telegram have both. I agree that there needs to be more clarity about this (also have been using Telegram for years and found this out only recently), but I don’t agree that this makes WhatsApp chat more private and secure. Sure, they are encrypted better, but if the company behind it still harvests a shitload of data from you in order to sell it, that seems a bigger problem for my privacy and security tbh. For me big tech and surveillance capitalism is a bigger worry than third parties trying to access the contents of my messages. the normal chat is also encrypted but not p2p.   
I think you missed the point what telegram is. The point on using Telegram is, that you are away from zuckerborg and his friends. Your data will not be used for crappy marketing purpose. 

If you want more security than you may look here : [https://www.securemessagingapps.com/](https://www.securemessagingapps.com/)

There are others out there, who are not on the list, but you will lose comfort and ergonomic while using them. No picture sending, no audio, no GIFs and sticker, text only and not reliable fast delivery.   
Frankly, you have not to worry that someone is spying on your data for other reason than a marketing purpose. Because, at the end of the day, if you really become a Target of some investigation, then there is no messenger secure enough, to prevent that your data will be breached in some way or another. Cybercriminals and Professionals don't use these kinds of communication anyway. I think its better that way

Not all of us need encryption on every single word we communicate... And when we need to keep something secret then that option is there with secret chat

Other helpful features like history, search and channels are much under valued in current scenarios IMO It should be on by default and you should have to choose to opt out of encryption. Only Your confidential information is stored forever on their hard disk drives And Telegram splits the encryption key over multiple servers across the world so no single government that seizes their data with a court order or other means will have the full encryption key. Why can I have three devices with encrypted conversations in signal? Everything should always be E2EE, the longer the keys the better. I use Cryptomator on my personal files on my personal Nextcloud instance which encrypts the files

Edit: let’s downvote precaution because we prefer to be inane!! Unlike others like Signal, they are unable to manage multiple device encryption. 

In Signal, you can start on the laptop, continue on the iPad and seamlessly continue the conversation on the mobile phone I've also got confidential information stored on Gmail's hard drives but it's not the end of the world Then don't send your confidential information over some free messaging app you don't trust without using a secret chat. The phrase ""Telegram does not encrypt regular chats"" is objectively incorrect. They are still stored encrypted, and you can delete them anytime. The design of Telegram is that they don't leave a footprint on any device, and you can delete it after it's sent. What kind of ""confidential information"" you have?

I mean, grandma's wifi password is not that confidential. If you want really secure communication use encrypted mails, not an app downloaded from a store that allows stickers.

I love that now people is talking about E2E these days and have no fucking idea of what a encryption model looks like. Forever? Until you delete it. Or you can set up auto-deletion after you're away for a certain period of time. But you have to trust Telegram actually does this. And it has a good history in that sense - no data leaks whatsoever.  


They do not sell my data to advertisers, they do not comply to goverments on the first call - good enough to me. It's not the same thing. You start those chats brand new, no past history. Also they are less private and secure than Telegram's Secret Chats because of that, they can be used in many devices... Also they can be backed up. 

Telegram secret chats are device specific, no backups, no screenshots, you can clear the entire chat for both parties, etc. This approach is more secure because both of you have absolute control of where the chat is and what to do to erase it. 

It makes people more aware of what things they should use when sending something compromising, and not taking things for granted (like uhh, this is E2E encrypted by default, I'm secured). Because, again, Signal may not be able to read your messages, but you can't, and you shouldn't trust other people to keep things secret, neither you yourself. 

For example one of the use cases of that. Cybersex. Don't ever in your life store your partner's photos in your phone, don't keep them in a chat, clean that shit. But that's something most people won't do, even if their intentions are good (and they are if you know them).

Errors and ignorance is the real problem. Also be aware that by using these 2 apps you're probably already marked as someone who has something to hide. Yeah, you're talking about the app that have bugs that erases whole conversations and have no complain policy since you own your data?

Just read the user reviews in the store... Come back and report your fidelity to Signal. The whole point of Telegram is the Cloud Chat, make E2EE mandatory and it become WhatsApp. A dull app.

When people will start to understand that Telegram users don’t want E2EE. It’s not a bug it’s a feature. Signal doesn't work with previous chats, that's the beauty with Telegram. All your previous chats are accessible from any device where you are connected. Start a draft on one, switch to desktop to finish the message. Signal doesn't support this. > no screenshots

that’s inane. Nothing can prevent that your peer takes screenshots with another device

> someone who has something to hide

Is there anybody who hasn’t? E2EE is something you will regret not having had once it’s too late. Keep defending inane opinions Exactly. That's why I started to use it some years ago. If there were no cloud chats, I'm not sure I'd use it. it’s really not that big a deal. 

if you want convenience above privacy you already have that with messenger and hangouts. Yes, nothing can't prevent the other person to take photos with another device. But that's up to the person you're talking with, not Telegran who is at least trying to prevent it. If you try to take a screenshot internally you'll see a black screen or right away a message telling you that it's not possible. 


>Is there anybody who hasn’t?

I mean by some government. So that you may get more attention. 

""This guy's using a program not US based, with no known backdoors and with a history of being used by terrorists, child abusers, etc. Why?"" kind of thing. If something happens around where you live, you'll be the most suspicious person just by using something as trivial as a messaging app (but that's exaggerated, it's just to give you perspective). The point is that: we know. 

We use Telegram because it’s private enough (compared to the rest of the Facebook / Google ecosystem) and it’s also insanely useful. 

PS: Thanks for the Cryptomator reco, looks amazing. Telegram is the most feature rich messaging platform. If it's not a big deal for you, then just use Signal. And lacks the most important feature that you will regret not having had: E2EE by default No, maybe for you, but I couldn't care less if Telegram can ""supposedly"" read my tomato sauce recipe. Convenience and features is more important. Oh and Telegram has not leaked one single byte of information to authorities so far, unlike Signal (even though they can't share much).."

Does support respond to bug reports?;2;kyiikh;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kyiikh/does_support_respond_to_bug_reports/;4;"I have sent numerous bug reports to the support chat but have never gotten a response (and in the chat i have the two checkmarks immediately as if they have seen the message). 

&#x200B;

In case the developers/owners/anyone knowledgeble reads this subreddit here are a few bugs:

\- On android 11 I am not able to get the chat heads to work, I have enabled them in the notification settings and enabled the app to draw over other apps, but the chat heads simply never appear, except for two instances when it appeared while I had gaming mode active (which should in theory block these chatheads) and when I clicked on the chathead it appeared to try to open but then close itself both times. (Android 11, Oneplus 8, oxygen os 11.0.2.2.IN21BA

\- I have received a 1second duration self destructing message which I could look at for as long as I wanted until I closed it (the timer at top right seemed to be at the very top from the moment I opened it)

\- Don't know if this one is a bug or just not implemented - on my macos device I am able to choose extra options such as location or camera when I hover over attach file button, but on windows it doesn't expand, and I couldn't find the functionality to send location OR take and send photo immediately anywhere in the application";2021-01-16 15:59:36;"About the chat heads, I'm on Android 11 also and it works fine for me. Maybe there's an issue with Oxygen OS. I'm on a Pixel 5, with pure Android 11. Had no issues with chat heads working as soon as I activated the option.

On Windows, I don't think it can give you a location option because laptops usually don't have a GPS chip on them, it's usually your IP based approximate location (which can be easily spoofed). After submitting this post I got the chat head once again (while in gaming mode again) and it worked fine until I closed it, now it won't appear again. Do you know if there's any way to force a chat head to appear such as messenger has? Press and hold the Telegram icon, press the ""i"" button (to get into app info), click on notifications, Bubbles, and make sure ""All conversations can bubble"" is selected. I think by default it's set at ""Some conversations can bubble"". Yeah I've done that, I think you misunderstood me - I meant in messenger you can go to a specific person's chat and you can click ""show as bubble"" for the bubble to appear without having to receive a message, however I couldn't find this function in telegram."

I don't understand why this wasn't always the case. Telegram uses webP for its sticker already. But you had to create them from PNGs. How to do this?

This is exactly my thought!! I think you confused it with WebM at first On Android, you can access all your sitkcers as webp on the internal storage - whatsapp - media--stickers.

If not, download them as an image from whatsapp web. Which would be the easiest way to do it? Pretty sure it's @Stickers Same? Maybe try downloading them as an image from WhatsApp web and then do that? No, the animated stickers are very limited on Telegram. It needs to be in TGS extension.

I bet there are some online converters, but i guess just openning an webp with gimp and saving it as png could work as well, i personally just use the dwebp commandline tool, but that is not an option for everybody. Maybe try downloading them as an image from WhatsApp web and then do that? There's also a bot for converting images to the right size. @StickersConverterBot Thank you! Thank you, good Hunter"

Question: Clear Storage;2;kydd9c;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kydd9c/question_clear_storage/;4;"Pretty much every app that I've downloaded works the same, but Telegram is different, and that made me uncomfortable- so maybe someone here can explain to me and help me understand what's going on.

When I decide to try an app and then uninstall it, I always go into my phone's settings, apps, click on the app I'm uninstalling, go into storage & cache, press clear storage, and that deletes all user data + cache before I go back to hit uninstall.

With telegram, when I hit storage & cache, it takes me to a whole different page (kind of like what the Chrome app does too) and even if I press clear data, there still remains like 4.xx MB of user data that I cannot delete before uninstalling. 

I'd appreciate any help to learn why it works that way rather than the original way with all other apps. I noticed Telegram X can clear all data just like any other apps, but the original Telegram app works differently.

Thanks";2021-01-16 09:03:22;"Uninstalling an app will clear all its data and cache regardless, clearing data beforehand is pointless, also it works that way simply because Telegram designed it this way as apps are allowed to chose what the clear data option should do (either simply clear the app's data or open the app's storage management settings)

Which for Telegram it makes sense, if one simply wanted to get rid of it they can just uninstall it, but if one simply wants to free storage it would make more sense to simply make the clear data option open Telegram's own storage management settings as it gives more precise control in what to clear without the user having to configure the app from scratch again Thanks for your reply. That's good to know, because I wasn't sure if uninstalling actually cleared all data since sometimes I'd still find folders in my files app with the name of the app that I uninstalled so I got into a habit of clearing all data just in case.

I guess my only other question is- is the only difference between Telegram and Telegram X the aesthetics (animations)? Why does Telegram X exist when there's already Telegram? Telegram X (previously known as Challegram) for Android was basically an app that won a client development competition and became an officially endorsed Telegram app client written entirely from scratch with the purpose of being faster, prettier and more battery efficient, but development has slowed down to a crawl recently so no updates have been released in months Aw man that's a bummer. I have tried Telegram X for a while and I really liked it, but yeah I noticed it wasn't getting updated like the official Telegram app. Wish they can focus on making X their main app. Faster, prettier, and battery efficient sounds great to me."

**Owned by**
- Independent Organisation “whose business model is 100% shrouded in secrecy”, “has changed HQs at least 4 times”, “zero transparency in terms of corporate structure/ public reporting”.
- Basically we all just have to take Pavel’s words at face value, because his claims have never been independently verified. 

**Privacy focused? (A GIANT ASTERISK!)**
- E2EE off by default. No Multi-device access for E2EE. Means, in theory, TG chats can be leaked thru server. But here I agree, I don’t see any proofs of it having leaked. 
- Encryption algos are closed-source. Not verified by independent experts. Again, just take Pavel’s words at face value. 
- WA does have self-destructing message.


To understand more about TG’s shortcomings, visit [Secure Messaging Apps](https://www.securemessagingapps.com)

**Features**
- ~~Pin messages do exist on WA~~
- TG multi-device support doesn’t work for E2EE (i.e. Secret Chats)
- WA allows its sticker community to make stickers directly from photos. (Not sure how that is done, but I have never seen that in TG)
- Regardless, the two features a regular user will care about are Stories (which TG doesn’t have) and Call quality (which sucks on TG - literally the worst calls I have ever had in terms of quality). Some other Privacy considerations.   
Telegram - no default E2E encryption.   
Whatsapp - Backs up to iCloud or Google, in plain text. Opensource: Client only Some info is not ok...

WA actually has self destructing msg.

Not everyhing is on the cloud for T.

WA doesn't have secret chats the way T.

2,00,000 **lolwut**

You can pin msg on WA too.

As far as I tried, 64MB is the maximum WA video size, but the FAQ says 16MB, which I think is incorrect as tested.

""unlimited cloud backup"" is kinda biased. On iPhone, you store it in iCloud, no limitation more than your own account space. No problem, I found this on twitter and thought of sharing here :) >Pin messages do exist on WA -

No, unfortunately they don't. You can't pin messages in Whatsapp, you can only pin chats on home screen.

>WA allows its sticker community to make stickers directly from photos

You cannot make WhatsApp stickers in WhatsApp. You have to rely on third party apps to create sticker packs. In Telegram you can create stickers using photos with @Stickers and @EZStickerBot. All without needing to install any other app.

>the two features a regular user will care about are Stories

Yeah but on their twitter they said they'll bring stories feature soon, so have to see when that'll happen.

>and Call quality

I haven't tested call quality but you might know better. TG also doesn't have group video calls but on their blog, they mentioned that it'll be added soon.


>Again, just take Pavel’s words at face value

This is very true. We only trust telegram for a few reasons. Pavel's words, TG's fights with authoritarian governments and E2E Secret Chats that only stay on the phone and verifiable open source builds.
But here's the thing, you shouldn't stop using telegram just because there's a trust element attached to it. Signal has been down for more than 15 hours and the only true alternative to WA is TG. If you were trusting WhatsApp's words till now, there shouldn't be a reason to not trust Pavel's because when privacy and features are balanced, you get an app that can break the Facebook monopoly.
The goal right now should be to break the monopoly instead of fighting over what's worse.

99% of common folks look for more features, not more privacy and that's the bitter truth. So if you can help break the WhatsApp monopoly, you're already doing more good than harm these big corpos can ever do. e2ee is not a magic black box, you can either

a) have e2ee but suck at other privacy stuff (see: WhatsApp)

b) not have e2ee but have other privacy protections (see: Telegram)

also, the way e2ee is built means no server-based multi-device access seems like its pretty enough to have his word at this point since it’s safe now. Huh? It is all that matters. You can't trust the server is using the opensource code anyway Really have to disagree with your last point. It's hardly worth leaving WhatsApp on privacy concerns to an app where the privacy is on the promise of one man who is running a business to make money, even if privacy was a big concern to him when he started there's no guarantee it'll stay that way and a few years later everyone may end up in the same position they're with WA now. With the lack of E2EE by default it just seems like a backward step overall.

With Signal it's privacy first and as the platform grows and mass users enter, features are being added to appease them. The key point about Signal however is that it's Not for Profit, they are not driven by making money they are only driven by their users and ensuring they're experience on the app keeps them satisfied. They're going through growing pains now but they'll come through it. Wouldn't you rather use an app where you are the customer, not the product? - Yes, you’re right. Sorry I got confused between pinning messages and conversations. 
- Please understand that Bots in Telegram don’t automatically abide by Telegram’s privacy policy, which essentially makes them super dangerous (also for your conversations’ privacy itself). They’re not so better than having 3rd party apps (unless you favour bots over apps - in which case, I’d say that’s subjective opinion. I personally like my chat app to be decluttered). 
- Trust element is the ENTIRE reason people are switching away from WhatsApp. Of course, Signal has been down - it is the most favoured choice for WA switchers. But it is handling it with competence (not like Vero’s 2018 meltdown). 
- If you feel users (or at least your dear ones) prefer features > privacy, please focus your infographic in that direction. Telegram remains the least private messaging app in my opinion - as simple as that. My understanding of E2EE. And yes, I do believe E2EE is something of a magic black box - that’s the entire freaking point of using it for privacy. 

E2EE makes multi-device access VERY complicated. 

- Telegram’s cloud-backed model isn’t built to support E2EE chats by default and that’s why it is even more complicated to introduce them for TG team. 
- Signal solves this challenge by using local storages on each of your devices - the challenge here is you can only access your chat history on a given device from the time of your first login on that specific device. This is why, Signal’s multi-device access falls short vis-à-vis TG. I think Threema does the same. 
- WA used to do it through over-the-network syncing (which needs your primary device to be on all the time). It also requires you to give WA permission to access your local network signal (not sure what this actually meant, but it was a separate permission I had to allow on my iPhone)

Threema’s [explanation](https://threema.ch/en/blog/posts/md-architectural-overview-intro) makes it a bit clearer.

**TL;dr** - E2EE is difficult and complicated, but that doesn’t mean it is impossible. Currently it is the gold standard for offering privacy on chat apps, and that’s for a reason. What happened the last time we trusted the word of just one man? Fuckerberg was born. That's where security audit comes in handy Then why are you here if you don't even use/like Telegram?
I use telegram because I like it more than WhatsApp, that's more than enough reason for me to switch to it, everything else is an added bonus.

Privacy can't help you if you're alone, Signal is an immature platform that needs time to grow. TG is good enough and not owned by Facebook.
Also, if you love Signal then you should use that, if it's working. Nobody's stopping you from using WhatsApp either. Signal's servers are located in USA, if government asks, they'd have to provide contact information of every single user they have since metadata keeps track of everything and can't be deleted because it's required for functionality.

If telegram is selling my data, I'd love to know who's buying it and how ads are being targeted using my data because last time I checked, Telegram doesn't own Facebook or Google so advertising is out of the question. As for confidential chats, they are in secret chats, that are e2e and not even accessible with my desktop app, so I'd love to know how telegram is able to read the messages I don't want them to see and how Telegram is ruining my life or how WhatsApp is better than TG.

Thanks. I think you should move to Signal. the @stickers bot is an official bot by telegram themselves, so it's just like a built-in feature >Telegram remains the least private messaging app in my opinion

Telegram is better than Signal and WhatsApp imo, even when the chats aren't e2e by default. To use either of those you have to give up a lot of functionality or data anyway. Also considering that my country has a lot of telegram users, almost all my friends and family are there. I voluntary choose to trust Telegram because of the features and Pavel's past decisions considering userdata.

Signal's servers are in USA, one of the least privacy friendly countries and NSA has funded its development too. I have reasons to believe that even when the server code is open source, the servers themselves aren't safer than TG because TG's servers are split between different nations along with their encryption keys. So even if a government decides to intervene, TG cannot provide them direct access.

Can TG read my public group chats? Maybe, it's possible but I don't think they'd ever give my data to private entities. That's the whole reason I trust them. I use Secret chats for anything important anyway, so I'm sure they can't read those when I can't even read those chats on the desktop app
.
As for the public groups, well, they're public. Information I voluntary choose to disclose.
Privacy isn't about hiding everything you can. Privacy does not equal to Anonymity. Privacy is about choosing what you want to share and TG's and Signal's privacy policies fit my needs.
If they ever do anything fishy, I won't take a split second to switch but for now, it's great and all I could ever ask for. what I mean to say is that having e2ee and _nothing else_ isn't that much of a security measure I think the only difference is,  Zuckerberg never claimed that he'd provide privacy to his users while Pavel's arguments to use telegram have mostly been about privacy and features. Now you are changing the trust factor to the audit. Like millions of other people right now I'm also looking to move away from WA and TG and Signal are the 2 main apps being spoken about right now, hence I'm following both. 

You can be a fan boy of TG and wish to promote it, I have nothing against that. You just seem to have the wrong end about privacy. 

This isn't a war of Signal Vs Telegram, people will use which ever app suits them best. They may even to choose to use them both. The more I research the more it looks like Signal is the best bet for the long term. It's Not for Profit so they'll never sell out to the next Zuckerberg nor try introducing features to make money of your data. If all my contacts move to Signal then you know you won't have to convince them to do it again a few years later, which doesn't look like you can say about Telegram. 1. Telegram’s servers are in the USA too, and also UAE, UK & Finland. UAE is no holy grail of privacy - far from it, and UK is part of the Five Eyes network. Finland doesn’t have these deficiencies, but it is also the country which doesn’t have jurisdiction on TG - so it can’t persecute them. So no, TG is not better than Signal when it comes to servers. 

2. Unlike TG, Signal doesn’t actually store messages on its servers, it does so on each device’s local storage. This way, it can’t be even asked to hand chats over, because it doesn’t have them. TG’s server, not only has them, but it has their encryption keys too! 

3. If you want to choose to believe that TG is safe _because it is convenient for you to believe that_, go ahead. But don’t claim that you’re doing it for the sake of privacy. 

4. Last, but definitely not the least, Telegram is owned by a for-profit company, that is offering TG for free. Just like Facebook does with WhatsApp. 

- Signal is different coz it is non-profit (which is better than for-profit in this case, and also better than “not-for-profit”). 

- Another alternative: Threema. It is a paid app, means you’re the customer and not the product. Also it’s based on Switzerland - the land where internet was invented, and the land of ProtonMail. Also by law it has to abide by Swiss privacy laws. 

Not here to convince you to use any specific app. I don’t know you, so I don’t care about what app you use. Just here because this topic interests me, and I do happen to have some knowledge on the subject. How so? Not what he said after buying WhatsApp. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Well... Seems that you don't understand what to trust. Try r/privacy and r/privacytoolsio To each its own. I won't move to Signal until they add all the other features Telegram has. I can't give up the bots and channels that makes me more productive. nothing is safe if it's alone I know what to trust and the trade offs. 

Just trying to bring some awareness to this group."
In Uruguay;186;kyba47;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/qw184s7d9mb61.jpg;44;;2021-01-16 06:48:03;"It's on the second place in Germany. :D Excellent, keep the momentum. [Same in Argentina. ](https://i.imgur.com/tCEOuvw.png) I checked in my country and Signal is on the 1st place, I am shocked. But Telegram on 20th :/ [This](https://i.imgur.com/C5ktgv8.jpg) is from Turkey It's second in Brazil with signal being on first place Im wondering why ppl choose telegram over signal? These are only usability or perhaps features reasons? Certainly not privacy related Yes! First is signal? [Same in Venezuela](https://i.ibb.co/bHNGwy2/image.png), but WhatsApp is much higher. What is your country? That’s the way Just usability. I prefer signal, but I use more often Telegram because of the pc app for calls, history/file storage and being able to be logged on every device at the same time. Not my reasons, but Telegram is way fresher, have stickers, and all of that. Some channels I follow are only available on Telegram, Signal does not have channels in the first place. > These are only usability or perhaps features reasons

Those reasons are very important yes. Telegram is a dream to use. Telegram has already many users, the thing that pushed Signal is its better privacy. Yep. What do you mean by Whatsapp is much higher? Poland

Also, on App Store, not Google Play for that matter Pc app for calls, you mean those bots?
I agree that usability in telegram is better than in signal, also feature reachness, 

but being able to be logged in at every device is also feasible in signal Signal has stickers. I’ve “created” a couple of stickers sets from the desktop app from which you can hold E2EE group videoconferencing with up to eight people sure, everyone uses what is preferred although just to be clear signal also has those stickers (frankly I don’t use it), fresher? “all of that”? that’s not very precise Generous Channels and bots are the only reason. 

Signal is E2EE encrypted, so my messages won’t be stored in plain text on somebody else’s hard drive forever Telegram guarantees your privacy but your data is stored on their servers, which is to provide more functionality in an messaging app It's app 8 in his image, and in others it's also around that number. And in Venezuela it's app 5. Bots? What do bots have to do with calls?

And yeah, Telegram is pretty good for usability. It's just not... how'd you put it... too relevant for the concerns people have. ""Oh no, this company sells my data, let me move to another just-as-centralized company who may do the same in the future"". However, Telegram has stayed true to not selling people's shit up until now, unlike WhatsApp, Facebook, Google, etc.

I do understand it, though. Everyone could move to Matrix and boom, decentralized, not depend on a centralized company that could hold their comfort hostage in order to violate their privacy. But then who's got Matrix? Setting up a server ain't easy, it's not popular or easy enough to join or to use, etc. Apps need to welcome mainstream adoption in every aspect or they won't ride the migration waves. Telegram, however not-privacy-focused it is, is adapted for lower-than-average-tech-savviness adoption. I mean, not that I care, but, Telegram looks more modern than Signal, and it's more customizable.

Also, depending in which country you live, there could be more people already using Telegram, and people like having contacts when they install the app. Bruh just open secret chat on Telegram. Also Telegram normal chats are still encrypted. Just not e2ee Channels, bots, better stickers, better desktop app, theming, free 2gb upload, voice chats, and more. But they use C2S encryption wich is not great compared to E2E well that’s true although what is strange for me are the ppl who drop WhatsApp towards telegram because of privacy issues in WhatsApp, ironically the content of chats are better secured than in telegram because of e2e encryption, telegram is better in terms of usability and feature reachness but certainly not in terms of privacy related topics Bro, Signal is encrypted with group videoconferencing on multiple devices. 
If it’s not E2EE, it’s useless Fanboys be tapping that dislike button on your comment. But you're right. Telegram is absolutely great for usability. Best thing around for that and the ethics they've displayed over the years. But it doesn't change the fact that it's not, by default, as secure as e2e encryption.

Even though Telegram has e2e encryption, it not being available for groups, multidevice, or enabled by default, put it at a great disadvantage when comparing how secure it is for the average user. Yeah but WhatsApp does have your entire info set (network of contacts, group titles, photos, status, IP address, logging in and out times, etc.) in a database that it intends to sell. That's anything that's unencrypted. Telegram has instead said it will sell nothing. You're right in the sense that moving to Telegram is not the best choice privacy wise, but that doesn't make WhatsApp faultless in the ordeal. How many participants? 😂 lol. Also, signal exposes your number 👀 right but these are metadata and content of a chat is much more important, and telegram moderators regularly check chats of groups and ban them that is really alarming, no such thing is possible with groups on signal

https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/telegram-channels-banned-violent-threats-capitol/?guccounter=1

From what I see basically nobody from telegram users use those secret chats, I’m testing also telegram and it’s pretty inconvenient, other person needs to be online at the time of chatting 

so you could even say that telegram is even worse than WhatsApp from privacy perspective I always use secret chats, soooooo.. no, the other person doesn't need to be online all the time when you chat. They only need to get online once to create the secret chat, due to the multidevice characteristic of telegram (secret chat is created in the most recently used app that supports it)

Those channels that got banned were public, by the way, as in, in their preferences, they had set them as ""public"", and had a username and a link that could be indexed on Google. However, it is true that moderators can and do access non-public channels and groups in order to remove illegal content, mostly child pornography.

The reason why these people use Telegram and not, for example, Signal, to share their illegal content, is that Telegram has natively implemented the virality of content. It is stored in the cloud, which has a few consequences:

1. You can download it now or later, whereas on WhatsApp if you take too long, it stops being available.
2. You can forward it without reuploading it, as it is sent by reference.

You can also click the name of who sent it originally and see the channel where it comes from. This creates enormous forward chains that make channels grow to the thousands in no time.

On E2E encrypted chatrooms, this is... simply not possible. You'll be eternally bound to your circle of buddies. People on Telegram love this virality effect, and people who share illegal content love it all the more, because it not only enables content to travel outwardly massively, but for it to be forwarded from other groups onto yours with extreme ease. Content-sharing groups will therefore reap much more for less effort.

Privacy-wise, it's quite bad. But I guess Durov was working more from his experience with VK, trying to make it as appealing to the masses as possible to push his i-can-do-whatever-i-want, freedom-when-convenient agenda. so telegram moderators can access content of on public groups but don’t you think they could also access private (not secret) chats? Have you seen telegram backend server source code?..

Especially taking into account that encryption keys are on telegram servers encrypted with their own algorithm which doesn’t have good feedback..

I’m testing telegram those groups are nice, but basically I use it only for those groups eg the ones giving me info about traffic jams accidents etc in my hometown but I don’t use it for any private chats I simply don’t trust signal..

Usability some additional nice feature yes but privacy? Not at all I told you they do have access to them. Read well. From your message it seemed moderators can access (non)public channels and groups, not private channels but it seems they could access all,
Anyway like I said usability yes privacy hell no"
Are sticker packs public?;8;kyb741;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kyb741/are_sticker_packs_public/;4;I want to create a sticker pack using some friends faces but I don't want strangers to find this pack, are these packs publicly available for everyone to find or do you always need the link to add it?;2021-01-16 06:42:44;"When you send the sticker even without the link to a stranger it can be saved and distributed. Although you can always delete the whole pack (it gets a little complicated after that). It's better if you don't make a sticker pack such as this in the first place. Treat Sticker packs as a group of gifs/pics: anybody who sees them can save them, and probably will post them to some place you don't intend.

My advice: don't make it from your friends faces. It's not funny as you thought it might be. Ok but suppose we only use it between us, is there a public repository where a stranger could find the pack? As a workaround they might try to have the .webp stickers saved on their phone, I believe you can send them as file and they get displayed as a regular sticker (without having a whole pack attached and not having a public link)"

Will Telegram bring in End to End encryption for all messages?;2;ky85w8;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ky85w8/will_telegram_bring_in_end_to_end_encryption_for/;14;I really like the look and feel of Telegram and it seems a really established app that is well positioned to disrupt WhatsApp in this current fiasco they've spun up. But even WhatsApp has end to end encryption as standard, why doesn't Telegram? I know they market themselves as being a secure platform so why not do E2E by default?;2021-01-16 03:45:13;"Personally i hope not. I really like that you can choose, and i think the cloud chats are way more user friendly. I would prefer having all my chats as cloud chats, because i don't think telegram will do something shady with my messages (if it works for the hong kong protests its safety will suffice for me). For those who prefer e2e it's available, and i don't think most people really care about e2e. E2E encryption for all chats sucks. I don't want it and probably most telegram would hate it too. Telegram uses mtproto for normal encryption. But regardless about e2e it's because telegram is cloud based and saves all the data. It's basically unlimited free storage. I have all my data and chats on telegram since 2014, with e2e this wouldn't be possible and i personally like it this way. 

About recent WhatsApp fiasco, two years ago telegram had 200m monthly active users, now 500m. So they don't need to change much because they are already getting bigger and bigger everyday at a ridiculous speed. If you are thinking about signal, their play store download count recently went from near 50m to over 50m (play store shows anything between 10m and 50m as 10m)they are no competition for telegram, specially with only 20m active users. On the other hand telegram has been on 500m downloads for a long time, soon they get 1B. The only reason why it's not e2e is because of cloud backup. You're placing *at lot* of trust on them. You never know what they're sharing with others behind the scenes, and 'not sharing stuff' with HK protesters might just be for good PR. China could $%# HK if it wanted to but it relies on the West too much to be that extreme. Most people don't care about e2e because of ignorance, not because it's just 'nerd stuff'. Can you expand what it means to be a cloud based system and why enabling e2e would restrict that? 

I'm sure there is a good reason for them not enabling by default but I don't really get it. You can have e2ee cloud backups, but they don't do it for some reason. I'm not an expert on this matter but think about WhatsApp. In order to use desktop client you need to connect your phone to your pc. Otherwise your pc wouldn't be able to see messages because they are end to end encrypted and only your phone can know what's going on. That's why when you disconnect your phone suddenly you can't use desktop client. Plus if you don't take a backup of your files and delete WhatsApp then everything is gone forever. With telegram all the data is on servers and encrypted with mtproto. The decryption key is divided into several parts and each server has only a small chunk of the key.
But remember these are all in theory, in reality both WhatsApp and telegram can have their own back doors. Suspicious Exactly, and it's not multivariable calculus to copy-paste your chats and encrypt them yourself, but people are just lazy. So telegram is mainly for people who think most of their messages are not going to be a threat to the government are the target audience No shit, but we can't be sure Telegram's not sharing stuff or has a zero-day that any hacker can compromise. They're misleading people into thinking they use 'encryption'. It's fine for the average Joe if they don't, but they should stop lying about it. Yeah I agree about that, it seems that people who have tweeted about this got it deleted by the account page"

I think you cant stop IOS from taking screenshots Yes, I'm aware. But why? Yeah, he’s probably using iPhone. (Don’t blame Telegram, iOS technical stuff). Well.. it’s technical stuff. On Android, you have more control over the OS behavior, and there are ways to prevent Android from taking a screenshot.

On iOS, you can’t change what it does. Every app runs inside its own “playground”, and the app can do nothing to the OS.

I’m sure if there was a way to prevent iOS from taking screenshots in a secret chat, telegram team would absolutely use it! I see. I'll just avoid sharing any sensitive content with iOS users then. Thanks for the answer! Yeah, we should be absolutely careful!

A good solution might be to use self-destructing messages and set it to self-destruct after a couple of seconds. Might be a better solution than not sending anything to iOS users.

Have a good one ;) I am aware of that one, but still, I'm afraid the other person may be fast enough to screenshot anything, you know? I'll just stick to not really sending anything too sensitive to iOS users for the time being. Yeah, that’s reasonable concern.

Overall, I see a tendency of Apple to bring more “freedom” to iOS. Hopefully, we’ll have that feature on iOS too, so we won’t miss out on anything interesting (I’m an iOS user myself)😅"

Sending Attachments Uncompressed;0;kxwzfm;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kxwzfm/sending_attachments_uncompressed/;7;How do I configure Telegram as default the sending of attachments uncompressed?;2021-01-15 18:40:33;"on desktop just drag and drop and 2 squares will appear (with and without compression)

on mobile you click the attach menu then file I think yes. When you click the paperclip in chat to send something, instead of choosing from the gallery choose 'File' along the bottom first, then Gallery and the file will be sent uncompressed but less easy to see in line.

[Here's a screenshot to help](https://imgur.com/a/6w7oyJS) Is there no way that I can make the sending of uncompressed files a default setting in Android Telegram? Thank you for your response. Yup. I already know that.

The image files that I was sending before doesn't get compressed. I was just surprised when my client told me one time that the graphic files that I have sent him looked ""shrunken"" and they won't open so he could zoom-in/expand them so he could view them better. I resorted to use an encrypted shared cloud folder to go around this and just provide a link to my client. This is what made me believe that Telegram has probably implemented this revision in its later/latest  versions.

I was able to find the option that you are sharing which I find useful. However, it could only be used per file/per attachment. I was hoping that someone could advise me how I could attach and send files uncompressed as a default setting so I need not do the option that you have mentioned.

I still appreciate that you have responded. Thank you for taking the time. Cheers. To my knowledge, you can't Ah I see. You can select multiple files with a long press in the file browser (Android app) but I think that needs all of the files in the same folder. Maybe still not the perfect solution but hopefully some further help. Yes. That is really my challenge - selecting files from different folders. I have to copy them in a folder so I can select them all and send them uncompressed.

Speaking of selecting multiple files, I hope Durov and his team would include ""batch select"" capability in their later version of Telegram so we need not select each file.

Cheers."

https://i.imgur.com/WwYFzUJ.jpg Once the end of Hangouts was announced, I was debating between Signal and Telegram. I chose Telegram. I've been using Telegram for a year now. 

I did download Signal a few days ago to give it another shot, but today their servers have been down for a couple hours now.. not good at all. Based Japan!! Welcome to the Telegram ⛩️ I wish it starts catching on in the Caribbean sigh 😞 UK ranking:

1 Signal
2 Microsoft Teams
3 Telegram \#5 Poland. 

WhatsApp(2), Messenger(3), Facebook(4) and Signal #1 Alphaville’s big in Japan starts playing in the background. XD ey i thought local choose Line Why the fuck BİP is 4th in the list? BİP is Turkish state sponsored spyware! How did it get so popular in Japan? I didn't know Bip and Dedi apps( Turkish apps)  are available in Japan. I saw they are very popular. Today I learned about Signal...

P. S. Russia: 1. Telegram 2. Getcontact 3. Signal FYI  Telegram is getting traction in JP cos lots of dealers are using it lol Yea but everyone has it already so it can’t be on top dl. On a slight tangent, how is LINE in terms of privacy? I've been using it since 2019 and I like it, but I'm not sure how ""secure"" it is. What about the Finns? Telegram is banned in China Can't believe Chinese spyware Zoom has become so popular. I mean isn't Microsoft Skype safer? https://youtu.be/jsMfSKX1KTw?t=24s Viber still #1 there, even Skype seems popular in Ukraine at #8? Telegram also has shutdowns, so it is better to use something P2P without third-party services. The pirate lords probably don’t get cell reception at sea. Wow is MS Teams popular in the UK? would you like to prove that accusation somehow? Makes sense İt's not that hard. İf you're concerned about privacy just use signal Ethiopia toom almost everyone wjo has smartphone here uses telegram. Yeah, I know, it was a hypothetical statement. Why? I wouldn't say either is really ""safer"". Both are spyware at the end of the day. It just depends on who you want to harvest your data and trust to protect it.

I'm not sure what you mean by Chinese spyware though. I'm pretty sure they are an American company. I have not experienced anything like that with Telegram. Maybe I just got lucky?

Anyway, Signal is still down. Why are you like this huh? 😂 Yeah it might be because we're in a national lockdown currently. I didn't know what it was until I looked at the app description. Zoom is 4th Its China, they ban basically every platform they can't censor. Reddit, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are all banned there I read they leaked information to China Zoom censored stuff about Tiananmen square Reddit is an American company, but they holders are Chinese. Oh, I mean it also happens with Telegram sometimes, but not while many users join it. Interesting!"

What features do other messaging applications have that Telegram does not have?;0;kxtmp1;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kxtmp1/what_features_do_other_messaging_applications/;9;"I made a reddit post here about how Telegram does not seem to support certain features with regards to sending pictures. The editing of uncompressed photos whether it be a single photo or by group is not available before sending the picture. The caption box interface is also lacking when it comes to sending without grouping for a group of photos because it is only one box and that caption will appear on the first photo of the ungrouped photos. This means you have to edit the caption for the rest of the photos after sending them.

For a power user application, I cannot believe that Telegram does not support this. But I'm not throwing hate on the application. It's just a realization that even Telegram may not have features which are present in other application. No, I'm not talking about stuff like encryption or security.I see some people complain about security and encryption and I believe the developers have intended to make Telegram the way it is. Besides, there are just so many ways you can make an application that you have to choose where it stands. I literally mean things that Telegram does not have but you can totally put it if you wanted to without having to go too far from the original intentions of the application.

What features do other messaging applications have that Telegram does not have? Which of those do you feel Telegram should have?";2021-01-15 15:31:02;"No matter how big you make your fonts, Telegram's menu, text edit box & chat-list fonts will remain tiny!! Try third-party client like Plus. Official app is kind of limited IMO. Telegram doesn't support syncing of secret chats between the phone app and the desktop app. Signal does that. Status, Reactions and in-group channels as Discord. You are doing it wrong. It's not lacking the feature What are in group channels in Discord, as someone who doesn't use Discord? It also doesn't make breakfast like my mother Which feature are you pertaining to? I'd like more detailed instructions if there is really a way.

To make this clear, let me put pictures into three categories: 

1) Individual - A single photo

2) Batch Grouped - Multiple photos in a single message

3) Batch Ungrouped - Multiple photos in one message each.

Let me make this clear. You can definitely edit and put captions to all the pictures after sending them. But my concern is before sending the pictures. I'm not complaining that you can't do it, but rather the convenience of doing it before the sending. So I hope no one replies to tell me that you can do it, because I know you can do it. They have to make it clear in which part.

For editing before sending, you cannot do it for all three situations.

For adding a caption before sending, you can do so for categories 1 and 2. But for 3, the caption only appears for the first photo. This is understandable since the interface only shows one message box.

If there is a way to edit or adding captions for category 3 for the rest of the photos which I am not informed of before sending, I'd appreciate it if someone replied. On simple terms it would be like inside groups you have sub groups, this helps to organize conversation with a lot of users."
Can't believe Telegram still doesn't have an edit and caption option before sending a picture like WhatsApp;0;kxt3ws;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kxt3ws/cant_believe_telegram_still_doesnt_have_an_edit/;14;"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Telegram and prefer using it over WhatsApp. I have already quit WhatsApp because of the privacy issue. But one thing I loved about WhatsApp is that there are features for editing pictures and captions before sending them. Telegram can edit pictures but only after sending the photo first.

One practical usage for me is that whenever I send pictures without grouping in WhatsApp, I put a caption sometimes to indicate labels. With Telegram, you can only add a caption to the FIRST photo before sending. You have to manually edit everything else.

It's much easier on WhatsApp because before sending they have an editing interface where each photo is contained in a page with a gallery you can scroll through in the bottom so if you wanted to put captions it is less of a hassle.

I still love Telegram more, but I can't believe they missed out on a power user feature that WhatsApp has. An easy fix would be to do something similar to WhatsApp. When you click the Send button, it should not immediately send photos but launch the editing interface that Telegram already has but add in a page system to accommodate the multiple photos. Then for the send without compression, have the pictures be uneditable but allow the addition of a caption.";2021-01-15 14:55:45;"You're talking about this?

[https://imgur.com/a/glRJCcC](https://imgur.com/a/glRJCcC) You can though. Open the media tab, select photo/video and you can edit below before sending. A little lifehack: while you cannot edit before direct share, you can caption an image: just long tap the desired chat, not just single tap. This way you can also select multiple chats to send Yes, Telegram has an edit feature but it cannot edit before sending. Is there a way to edit before sending, for a single photo and for multiple photos? But for the photo to appear in the Media tab you have to send it first right? My bad: this doesn't add a caption, rather sends a separate message If you open a photo in google photos and share the photo to Telegram from that app then you don't get the option to edit the caption first. It's a direct share. But if you are in Telegram and ""attach"" the photo from within Telegram then you do get the option. No, you just open the media tab and tap on the photo/video. It doesn't send it and just opens up a tab for editing... Exactly But you can't put a caption for individual photos of a ""Send without grouping"" batch of photos before sending right? With the interface right now, putting a caption in the box will allow the first photo to have a caption but not everything else. I don't get this. For me, the Media tab is accessed in a private message by clicking the user on top and it only shows the list of photos you have shared and doesn't show any edit button. What do you mean? Could you explain again? Nope (unless I'm misunderstanding you). You can attach multiple photos and edit and caption each one of them separately. (Never did it before but just tested and it works.) Yes, but you have to send the photos first and then edit the captions. I'm talking about adding a caption before sending. My point is, you can do those things but the functionality is limited if you want to do those things before sending. You must send the pictures first before being able to do them. No, you don't. You only hit the ""send"" button after the edits are done and the captions added."

How can one verify e2e encrypted chats?;0;kxqlar;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kxqlar/how_can_one_verify_e2e_encrypted_chats/;6;"Hi all,

I've done some reading into e2e encryption which can supposedly be used to sent messages to another user via a (unknown) server in a way that using only the client code can verify that the message can not be read by a hypothetical men in the middle.

From what i understand, the signal protocol (and also most other encryption protocols, but this one is used by most big chat apps as i understand) uses a combination of the Diffy Hellman key exchange, where both users create a shared secret key. This way only the two users with this shared secret key can unlock each others messages.

Now this system is of course still vulnerable to a man in the middle attack, as ""he"" can create a shared secret with both person Bob and Alice, pretending to be Alice and Bob. This way an encrypted message goes from Alice to ""the men"", and from him to Bob. Because of this another (long term) shared secred is produced, which is used by Alice and Bob to verify that the public key used for the Diffy Hellman key exchange actually came from Bob and Alice. This however runs into the same problem, as ""the man"" can still pretend to be both.

I know that this problem is solved on the internet (the websites etc) by certificate ""companies"" who can verify these shared long term secrets. For example checking reddit right now i can see that the site i'm on i certified by ""DigiCert"", a company that is apparently trusted by Firefox (the browser i'm using right now). My question is, how can we know from any server that their certificates are used properly?

If it turns out i'm misunderstanding anything please also let me know, thanks in advance!";2021-01-15 11:43:54;"What do you mean by ""certificate used properly""? The server has to verify that Bob encrypted his public key to Alice (this is done in websites using certificates), so that Alice knows that the key was indeed encrypted by Bob. How can we know if this happens, and the server isn't in the middle of the conversation? To be 100% sure you need to compare the keys. In Telegram for example each secret chat has an ""Encryption Key""-tab. You need to compare this manually with the recipient if you don't trust the server. In Signal it's called a ""safety number"".

If I understood the question correctly.

https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/211828/man-in-the-middle-attacks-in-end-to-end-encryption Perfect, thanks a lot for the answer, i understand! This can only work in one to one chats right? I found that e2e encryption in groups can never 100% work, so i assume that's why telegram hasn't implemented this. For example in signal, would everyone in a group chat see the same encryption key?

Thanks again! Afaik (but I am not sure) the same key is used in groups in signal. That means you can verify the key independently of the group. When you send a message to a group the message is encrypted with the public key of every participant. This means it's as secure as one on one chats.

But as I said I am not 100% sure, you should check their implementation. Perfect, thanks a lot!"

Four small details I've liked about Telegram since moving from WhatsApp.;161;kxpmbg;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kxpmbg/four_small_details_ive_liked_about_telegram_since/;83;"I'll keep it brief .

1. Telegram actually removes deleted message UI.. Whereas WhatsApp leaves me with ""*This message was deleted*"". That really fustratrates me.
2. Telegram allows me to edit messages inline. With WhatsApp I have to reply to my mistake or you guessed it!...I have to delete the message and start over
3. Telegram lets me use gifs as display picture. In addition, I can have mutliple displays pictures which is cool. I feel like Telegram does a better job at preserving the quality of my display pictures where WhatsApp does a good job trying to remove pixels from my displays pictures.
4. Telegram gives nice previews of how a **setting** will impact the UI or behaviour. Its all round more friendly to use

Thats it!

Are there any other smalls details you guys like that I've missed?";2021-01-15 10:27:30;"Stickers rule on Telegram Have you already tried [scheduled messages](https://telegram.org/blog/scheduled-reminders-themes)? You missed the main one: cloud sync

You'll value it when you replace your phone, or need to use another alongside it. I really like how easy it is to make your own stickers I have a lot of fun in the group chats. Like the polls for me were a no turning back point. They’re simple, amazing, useful. 

Or the video message. I wonder why no one else hasn’t  copied that yet. I use them pretty often, they saved my life more than once while working on a project apart from my coworkers. Easy and light, not the same as a normal video I really like that you can swipe a message to answer it (double click on desktop client), makes it so much faster than going through the context menu. Also, the key shortcuts on the desktop client are generally really great. have you already tried [self destructing messages](https://telegram.org/blog/now-you-see-me)?  
....and [bots](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution)? Regarding your point 3:

You can't exactly have multiple profile pictures, your previous ones are saved and can be reused :D I like that you can also send pictures and videos choosing if and how much to compress them When i was starting to read i though you have written about difference between the ways how whatsapp's and telegram's last seens work. Saved messages section. Customized folders. Customized themes. Being able to create polls. Using telegram on your pc without connecting your phone to the internet. Message scheduleling. Setting reminders in saved messages section. The ways how you can render data and storage usage. Sending images with/without compressing. Creating or using bots. Bot API. Self destructed messages. Terminating active sessions. Saving or not saving images automatically to the gallery. Draft messages. Built in lock. Slow mode. Adding people by there location. private gif collection populated with Save Gif I just found the @vid bot the other day. Really handy YouTube video lookup You can look for Youtube videos and image search without leaving Telegram. Just type `@vid [search key]` or `@pic [search key]`.

As for me my favourite feature of Telegram is that its desktop client is awesome and multiplatform. My favorite feature is the unlimited storage for files up to 1 GB. The things telegram missing is, markdown and links support in group descriptions.
Animated stickers are almost impossible to make. Unlimited cloud space 😎 Let me be completely honest. Telegram is more advanced, but in a lot of ways, I prefer WhatsApp implementation. Shame about the Facebook thing, because I will gladly pay for WhatsApp subscription, if it's not sold to Facebook.

Anyway, regarding your points:

1.  I actually like WhatsApp implementation. ""This message was deleted"" is a proof that something is deleted. It prevents the situation of 'you say I say'. For example: somebody say something inappropriate and you call them out. In Telegram, they can just delete the message and said 'no I didn't say that, you misread', while in WhatsApp, there is proof something is deleted.

2. That's because WhatsApp has E2EE by default. It also means WhatsApp truly doesn't store your data once it's sent to recipient, unlike Telegram which stores everything in server. WhatsApp chat content is even more private than Telegram. 

3. While I prefer Telegram implementation, I understand where WhatsApp is coming from, which is to make it fast even for low-end phone or places where connection is terrible. It's just a trade-off.

4. Agreed. Search ‘VKM bot’, this lets you listen music for FREE online or offline.

You can also select some words and edit them like microsoft word with italic, bold, and strikethrough. This is just the beginning. I'm concerned about the ""number of contacts"" shown in the invite friends function. It's not what I'd like to see in a pro-privacy service:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/aosrd0/possible_privacy_flaw_number_of_contacts_of_other/ today i have discover:

if you send a picture and you add an animated sticker to it, it sends as gif with high definition. its fucking awesome Still no option to use front facing camera to make video calls in Android. Telegram is a rich messaging app. Just the privacy is the biggest let down. Everything should be e2ee these days The only thing that bothers me the most is the ability of the other person that is chatting with you to delete your own sent messages without any warning. That could be potentially dangerous in some occasions. Maybe this is an unpopular take, but I really hate how someone can just nuke the entire chat. It makes sense for secret chats, but I think it's overkill for normal ones


Edit: Oh yeah, and how individual messages older than 72 hours can just be wiped like they just never existed at all, that's worse took my dad all but 45 minutes to find out how to use animated stickers 😂 Viber has them too. Wow. That could be handy for birthdays lol I once sent a scheduled message to my gf asking how her day has been followed up with a reply ten minutes later saying ""that's great to hear, looking forward to seeing you"". Got a little awkward when she replied to the first message saying her day‘s been god awful Best pranks ever with that It’s an amazing reminder, i can’t believe we lived without it :) And you'll even value it more when you use both the desktop telegram and the mobile telegram. I send files back and forth between my computer and my phone by sending them to myself on telegram. And you can actually save a whole pack of custom stickers: try that on whatsapp and the app store page of the app they used to make the sticker will open, which is useless. How do you do it In the current version? I made some stickers several years ago and it wasn't really easy tbh I love telegram, and I love every single feature of it. But creating stickers is not SUPER easy. You have to create a pack, put a name, share the png with the exact dimensions, associate an emoji. Where in whatsapp you can do this with just one app and 3 clicks.

Don't get me wrong, that why stickers in telegram rule, the extra complexity gives them better quality and easy of use. But they are not easy to create. Thank you! I had no idea about the polls in group chat! Something I wish was possible in WA. I keep discovering features new to me every few days on this app, it's great You can swipe as well in WhatsApp The way to swap is different. On i OS, WhatsApp's gesture is like back gesture. It's 50/50 chance that you reply or go back.

Telegram does it right. I see. I just notice other contacts also had gallery of photos too Pictures not so much, can you? I know there‘s a way to send an image as if it were a file, but then it displays the image as a file, with filename, size and everything. It’s really good @like @vote @imdb @wiki are really handy as well. Up to 2GB actually. Speak for yourself, i make a living doing animated stickers! > I actually like WhatsApp implementation. ""This message was deleted"" is a proof that something is deleted. It prevents the situation of 'you say I say'. For example: somebody say something inappropriate and you call them out. In Telegram, they can just delete the message and said 'no I didn't say that, you misread', while in WhatsApp, there is proof something is deleted.

In Telegram, if someone replied to the message before it was deleted it will say ""message deleted"" above the replies to the deleted message. I agree with your first point. It's like Reddit comments being deleted. I spotted that that too. You’re right. But telegram doesn’t seem to have been built with privacy from the start? Is it mobile or desktop first application too? Not everyone obsesses over E2E. Perfect sync between devices is far more important to many. And you still have secret chats in case your really need E2E. Both parties have full control over the history of the conversation. It's quite nice if you keep it in mind. A nice kill switch 👍 Yeah, could be nice to have even a local backup (automated one, not manual) or something like that. My mother is still mad at my father because he once deleted the entire chat history while he was cleaning his work chats... I feel your pain - I have to delete messages with animations. You should at least know the dates. Was also immensely helpful when the clock struck 00:00 on new years eve! Exactly 💯 This. Very much this! >you can actually save a whole pack of custom stickers

How you do that [I'm with you on this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kxpmbg/four_small_details_ive_liked_about_telegram_since/gjcerz5?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) It literally takes 30 seconds to upload one XD (@)StickersConverterBot

Upload any images and it'll do the job itself ;) In WA you have to swipe right which is nonsense (apps usually use ""swipe right"" to return to previous screen).

In Telegram, you have to swipe left, which is okay Oh okay, haven't used WA in a long time, back then it was not possible. But it was not meant to be a comparison but rather a little feature I really like. Just tried it on WA iOS, for me it only goes back if I grab the very left edge of the screen. Anywhere else and the swipe motion always grabs the message for a reply. No chance involved at all, you just have to know how to use it. I’m very used to the WA way so Telegram always confuses me. It’s just what you’re used to really. Just wanted to note that there is no chance involved in WA if you know how to use it. Yes, you are right, thank you for correcting me. 

You can choose the compression level for videos, whereas you can just choose if to compress images. Bro, @like is fucking awesome!!!! Don't you think that people wouldn't pay you to do it if it was easy? 🤔 Yeah you're probably right it wasn't built with that from start. I think it was mobile first considering it was originally released for mobiles (2013 according to wiki).

But they've evolved since and it's fully multiplatform and they clearly focus more on privacy today with all the Facebook shit of recent years. I think they definitely should do something about this flaw. And that's the thing. I could just run a constant backup anway and keep all the messages, defeating this argument about 'having control over the convo'. I used to sort of do that, until mid last year the tool got my account banned for a few hours for some reason There's a setting to disable animations completely as well I try Just tap on a sticker and a pop-up will appear prompting you to add the pack to your sticker set: works similarly both on mobile and desktop Oh. Nice one. (never stops to amaze me telegram and it's bots) I am actually so used to the WhatsApp way, that I often inadvertedly return to the previous screen on Telegram, when I want to reply. The Telegram way feels very unintuitive to me personally. But thats probably because I still use WhatsApp more (lots of active group chats on there still). Inline bots area really underrated in groups. I dont really like how that one works, maybe I'm not using it right Making stickers is easy, animating them is not. Also the After Effects costs money. Oh! That.. I thought you are talking about creating a custom pack of favorite stickers from different sticker packs Let's say you want to ask people in a group if they like a BLT sandwich or not.

>@like Do you like a BLT sandwich?

A little pop up will appear right above the type window. Select that, and it'll post the question with a ""Like"" and ""Dislike"" button right below the question. Well NayamAmarshe was talking specifically about animated stickers, so animating them is definitely part of the making process That would be great. Sometimes you have to save a full pack, just BC you like 1 sticker there. I ended up creating my own pack with those stickers. I see, I would want it discord/messages style where is by default Make and making well are different things, in my opinion. It's pretty simple to *make* an animated sticker. Making it look nice is a different subject"

Helping moving from WhatsApp over to Telegram?;0;kxdbfk;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kxdbfk/helping_moving_from_whatsapp_over_to_telegram/;9;"So  I understand that not eveone is going to be as bothered about privacy  as me. (I am not trying to force them into it either, I'm not bothered)

But  with this new WhatsApp privacy policy I am wanting to move to Telegram  and/or Signal as my main (and possibly) only point of contact other than  standard texting. I am in a WhatsApp group with all the staff from my  store, the management put in there information that we should know or  like some stuff that needs completing. I have muted it as I don't get  any information through and it was annoying. They won't let me leave as I  'need to be in there for important information' 🙄

I  have not and not likely to accept the new policy from WhatsApp so  therefore my account will be deleted. How do I let them know that I'm  not doing it to be awkward and that I am doing it due to my concerns  about my privacy?

I am more than  willing to have them on Signal or Telegram. Just not WhatsApp. Is there a  way that I can word it to make them realise that I am not doing it to  be a pain and without it coming across as annoying?

Anyone in a similar situation? Lmk how you did it and if it worked, or how you came to a middle ground.";2021-01-14 22:54:46;"[Found this on r/signal](https://imgur.com/a/5etFwc0) You  can agree to the whatsapp terms and remain a user to read incoming messages. Just don't use it to reply or message anyone. Then, what are you losing or giving to FB? It is no longer your privacy concerns, it is on the people posting to the whatsapp group. It is their privacy concerns. IMHO You can literally just tell them that no employee is obligated to accept the terms of service of a third party organisation. If they have something important to say, they can email, phone or text you. Or use the same IM app as you if they feel like it.

(Although, since you use IG, and sound like you intend to continue doing so, you may as well just stay on facebook altogether??) Before the new WhatsApp terms you were living just fine sharing data to Facebook. your job is important and you can not be disconnected of important related job activities, i would suggest get a cheap secondary phone for work related stuff and just install WhatsApp for being in contact and standard texting. It says at the bottom about Telegram not being any better than WhatsApp, I think the convinience about that is I don't have to share my phone number with people.
And tbh I use instagram, not a lot and only on my PC but still. Is it going to make any difference to me then? I totally understand that and tbh I am very much tempted in getting rid of Instagram I already have got rid of Facebook and haven't signed into messenger for a few months (so clearly don't need it) and I am slowly getting rid of social media, so Twitter and Snapchat have also gone (still open just not used or installed) That's actually a really good point, if it is a problem and that important then they can contact me directly. Well, it depends. The reason why telegram is considered not better than WhatsApp I suppose to be the recent news that we’ll see ads in channels and the lack of E2EE. Some users argue that you can’t have E2EE because you couldn’t sync the clients, but then signal just do that, and that “having E2EE doesn’t mean you are secure, because your device could get compromised as well” but that’s just dumb: it’s more probable for the telegram to get hacked than a single device get hacked or hacked and stolen.

Signal will implement username(s) as well, but remember that you have still to possess a mobile number for telegram and that signal purpose was never anonymity but privacy 

Anyway, about Instagram... if you don’t publish lots of your stuff it shouldn’t matter, though I suppose your interaction with posts are counted in as well. But better start late than never. After all to ads companies such as Facebook and Alphabet (google and co) all that matters are fresh data

EDIT: you can use both telegram and signal though, one doesn’t exclude the other I mean you can have a 'secret message' in Telegram which I believe is E2EE isn't it? The ads in channels is gonna be a HUGE pain. I'm not too bothered about my device being compromised but that is a good point tbh. I mainly just don't think it's right that I'm handing all that information to Facebook. IMHO I believe that Telegram is the better way to go but thanks for the insight, I'll be looking into it a little more, maybe signal is the way to go in the end. Telegram atm just seems a little more familiar and user friendly.
I don't post on Instagram. I did in the past but haven't anymore. I pretty much just use it for Fitness and mental health motivation to keep me on track with things. Yeah but it's a pain in the ass and you can't backup the conversation. As I said I'd install both and don't think too much over it"

Edit: When I say that hopefully proper authorities can also watch what is going on, I am talking about public groups. I do realize that they should not be able to specifically identify the person posting.  But I'm talking about a more general level of information about what might be circling in discussions around any particular issue for threat assessments.  For example, people talking heavily about some intended act of aggression that may cause harm to people in proximity to a specific event.  Like if a lot of people were talking about a plan for mass murder at a specific event or gathering.  That is information that I think could prove useful to proper authorities even if a specific person or persons couldn't be specifically identified.  If we silence such groups on common platforms, then do we reduce the chances of intelligence communities from properly assessing the situation accurately?  It is things that make you go hmmmm...."

1. Yes, it has 1 on 1 call only audio or video call.
2. As far as I know, yes. If you like it has private chats with a self destruct system, that is, after some time that you determine (2 secs, 1 minute) the message is erased.
3. You can create groups and channels to communicate to a group of people. I think it is better because you can set it so only you or admins are able to publish something while a chat option is available for anyone to ask or say anything. 
4. Yes, it is easy to use. It even has a chat with yourself (saved messages), programmed messages and animated stickers.
5. People need to have you as a contact on their phone and you should appear in their contact list of the app. Don't foget the username, you can create a username and people can find you with it. Also with the location."
Getting unwanted messages from strangers;0;kx79dd;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kx79dd/getting_unwanted_messages_from_strangers/;3;A friend of mine signed up for Telegram. Her privacy settings are all restricted to contacts, her phone number is hidden. She has no username and never enabled the local group feature. Yet she keeps getting inappropriate/sexual messages from complete strangers and she's considering quitting the app. I have tried all possible tweaks and she's still getting those messages. Is there anything that can be done about this?;2021-01-14 18:01:10;This is probably because the phone number was leaked eswhere. For example during a data breach on different websites. So her number is now part of a spam database which are sold constantly. Meaning someone just bought this database and is messing everyone everywhere they can. It's not telegrams fault. that's highly unlikely, because the phone number is quite new. this also never happens on whatsapp or viber, only telegram seems to have this problem Well no one I know has experienced something similar in the years of us using telegram so it doesn't seem as a telegram issue.

Personally I also use Telegram more readily than any other non-e2e service for the reasons you stated here. However, Matrix has proven we can have cloug-synced e2e, so I would feel better if Telegram could figure out a way to do this. But it's not a dealbreaker, and I've never launched a secret chat on Telegram, so I guess the things I talk about just aren't that private. > I enjoy the convenience of the cloud based storage because it allows for my conversations to be updated on all of my devices. In a secret chat with E2EE, this is not possible. A secret chat will only update on a single device that I use.

Signal (or Wire or Matrix or almost any other e2e-encrypted messaging app) does allow you to receive e2e encrypted messages on multiple devices, so this is just Telegram's fault in implementing e2e-encrypted chats their own way. The point you made generally stands because it is probably more secure to receive e2e encrypted messages just on one device

> Their API code is also available if you want to scrutinize their code.

If with ""API code"" you mean the backend code, then it's not - it is closed source and apparently they no longer feel like publishing it (see https://t.me/durovschat/515221). Their API specs docs, on the other hand, are open and documented.

> And for hackers claiming to be able to retrieve a user’s data, they offer a contest with a $300,000 prize for anyone who can accomplish it.

I don't understand why people still mention this, as the contest [ended in 2015](https://telegram.org/blog/cryptocontest-ends), almost 6 years ago. Yet it is still often used as a talking point. I genuinely wonder how's possible this thing is still circulating

> I think the general public falsely equates E2EE with an idea that they are more secure because of it.

They are generally more secure because with solid e2e encryption you don't risk your chats to be shared as a torrent zip around the internet, if someone ever manages to hack into Telegram's infrastructure. And as we've learned in the last decade, nobody's as secure as they claim to be. Durov can say they're impossible to hack as he wants, but the reality is that it's literally impossible to be that sure about that. Something that would help security experts evaluate Telegram's cloud infrastructure security would be seeing their sourcecode, but well, Durov said it is useless to publish it, so we're here taking their word about ""storage encryption keys being split across datacenters"". If you think it is important to mention that you split encryption keys across datacenters to protect data against physical access, you should also back up your claim with the sourcecode, since apparently you think that saying you're protecting your users data against that kind of attacks was important enough to mention it in your security FAQs. It's like saying ""yeah trust us guys we protect your messages with proper e2e encryption"" but your apps or protocol are closed-source (\*coff coff\* whatsapp \*coff coff\*)

And, in general, if Durov will ever decide to sell Telegram as he did with VK (which I doubt will happen but you never know), the users data telegram collected in the span of 8 (or more) years will become fully available to whoever will buy Telegram. Which wouldn't be the case for, eg., Signal (or Telegram's secret chats). Durov said he will never show ads on Telegram, and recently had to take that promise back because he's running out of money and TON unfortunately failed as a project. He recently [commented](https://t.me/durovschat/589563) on [a news](http://theinformation.com/articles/telegram-founder-in-talks-to-raise-debt-amid-apps-explosive-growth) about Telegram allowing some firms to invest in the messenger, saying that the news was not true - but he didn't completely close the door about taking loans from third parties. Hopefully he's sincere when he says they'll stay true to their values That's all right. Everyone should choose what he likes best! Awesome post. Thanks!

I would recommend you cross post it in the android subreddit, as  many more can take great advantage of this! Agreed.

Though... Will group secret chats ever be a thing? Both the apps are good. People can decide which one they want to use. 

But specifically targeting /bashing telegram regarding their security is nonsense in my opinion. Till now there is no concrete proof that they sell data or use the information to make money. Google, Microsoft etc. all collect, sell your data. No one talks about it. The amount info Google holds about you is unbelievable. Yet people use Gmail, Hotmail etc. don’t they?

Yes Telegram’s 300k$ security contest is over but the bounty programme is very much alive and every now and then they pay people who find out security issues.

Regarding their new plan to monetize telegram IMHO is a good thing. They are not compromising Security or selling your info. I will be happily paying a few dollars to telegram to keep the messenger running. 

Signal is also privately funded and heavily dependent on donations. At some point they will also run out of money and will have to look for alternatives to make money. 

Even signal's so called protocol has been decrypted by the Israeli company cellebrite. It’s only a claim. I don’t know how much reliable it is. But looking at cellebrite as a company it may be possible because they are the ones who specializes in unlocking/cracking (or whatever technical term they use) iPhones, android etc. they are the go to ones for CIA and FBI when they can’t get backdoor access. 

At some point may be signal, telegram etc. might get security breaches. But the intentions of pavel durov and brian acton etc is definitely good. Just support them as much as we can rather than bashing at one messenger over another .

Since the whatAapp issue occurred a few weeks ago many of my contacts moved to Telegram and signal. Yet people are more active on telegram than signal. So it’s their preference. Signal's cryptographers have ties to the Pentagon and other fed agencies.

Signal's initial funding came from the government.

[https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-crypto-keepers-levine](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-crypto-keepers-levine) This whole ""keys in multiple jurisdictions"" thing is just marketing bullshit. So what? The data is instantly decryptable on demand (e.g. when connecting a new device), so the keys are instantly accessible.
Yes if this is true then government interference is hindered. But this doesn't say anything about the fact that the chat data is fully readable by Telegram servers and people who control them. 
Not saying there is someone there randomly opening and reading our chats. But as the technical ability is there, who's to say when this might happen? Increased need for monetisation, sale of the service to another company with data mining aspirations, anything is possible. Imagine if Telegram is sold and the new owner wants to mine through chat data for advertising - they can! 
It's simply this fact that is constantly being shoved under the carpet that is quite worrying with regards to the constant babble about Telegram's privacy. >If plotting a terrorist attack or sharing kiddie porn or some other nefarious activity, then secret chats are obviously the way to go, along with implementing other available options to ensure that end devices are properly protected. 

This is literally the dumbest thing I've read all week. 98% or more of our regular conversations are meaningless to most other people.  However, if some of my co-workers could read some of the message rants I've sent... I'd probably be in BIG trouble at work. LOL

Edit: typo Please feel free to cross post if you wish with my blessing.  I try to keep a low profile online.  

I just joined this group because I love Telegram and the concepts behind it.  I've used it several years now and did a lot of reading before actually choosing Telegram over Signal.   


I keep seeing these posts from people claiming how inferior it is or the superiority of another platform.  As I've read these posts it occurred to me that some of these people are spreading false or misleading information to others.  It seems more like some entity or entities are trying to direct people away from Telegram in favor of other platforms.  And I question why.  Is it from ignorance or is it willful in nature?  Maybe some of both? 

Don't trust the hype of others.  Do your own research and decide for yourself.  I'm sticking with Telegram for now.  If their policies change one day and I feel less secure or I think that another platform offers ACTUAL better security, then my opinions will also change... most likely. I think there will be an eventual option for it, but really how secure is it if any end device becomes compromised in some way?  One single device that received a message that becomes compromised in any way then discloses the message.  I can see protections to prevent the information about the sender from being disclosed, but once a message is revealed then the secret is out.  Anything in the message can no longer remain trusted as private. Just my thoughts. >Will group secret chats ever be a thing?

They will be, according to Durov's channel. Never understood why people want them so much cause, you know, ""One person knows it - it's a secret, two people know it - it's a secret, three people know it - it's a rumor, etc."" Many are concerned that the founder of Telegram is Russian.  He was the founder of  VKontakte or VK for short.  It is the Russian equivalent to Facebook.  They often don't realize that while he was the founder of it, it was also basically stolen from him by Putin through a forced proxy sale so that the Russian government could use the platform to literally spy on users.  That is actually where he made most of his money that he used to establish ongoing support for Telegram.  He has real-world experience in fighting these authoritarian governments that want to spy on people.  He seems to be a genuinely good person with high ideals about peoples' privacy concerns.  I have a lot of respect for him and his brother. 

My second wife was Ukrainian, so I am very familiar with the plight and struggle of VK.  I loved VK back in 2014.  It was so much superior to Facebook back then.  It is a shame that Putin stole it. It clearly says no local engineers or physical intruders can access the data. You're welcome. I never claimed to be the smartest person in the world. Out of curiosity, what makes this so dumb? The OP isn't advocating for it, it's just that if you wanna do some illegal shit then of course you need all the extra protection you can get. Yeah, I guess that's always caused some level of Cognitive dissonance for me. Nothing I talk about is illegal, so why should I care? But also, nothing I talk about is Telegram (/Discord/Skype/Google/Facebook)'s business, so shouldn't I care? Ultimately Telegram seems like a good company and there are great options for using it on the computer, which is a big requirement, and unlike Facebook, their messenger is their main purpose, so they don't have anything to gain from selling or analyzing my data, so I stay there. >98% or more of our regular conversations are meaningless to most other people

If that was true then facebook wouldn't have paid 20 billion for whatsapp. Unfortunately it doesn't let me do the cross post. It's a shame this wise words not getting to more people. To me I only really use secret chats if I do want something private. Then I'd start it on my phone. And my phone never leaves me side anyway. And I have Telegram set such that it requires a passcode to open the app.

I agree with you though. The usefulness of cloud messaging is fantastic.

...But at this point I'd enjoy seeing Secret Chats for group chats just so people can shut up about it and use Telegram already. At least chats wouldn't be saved, I guess. Seems fine by me.

I swear there used to be the ability to set a different destructive timer on photos being sent in a secret chat too. Can't seem to do that anymore... Well if you couldn't do it, I want it implemented! (Example, in a secret chat with a one week timer, I can't send a picture that would destroy itself after 10 seconds.) Could you give some examples of how VK was superior? I'm not a user of either, but know common stuff about FB Which we have to trust, because they don't show the server source code. From a technical standpoint it's highly doubtful this would work at all. And because 'it says' it, then it's fine, we believe them, no problem, right? 
How exactly is it that people with access to the server cannot access the data? What measures are there in place? If Durov logs in as root/admin, can he not see plaintext chats? (rhetorical question to which he will never give a straight answer, of course)

People need to understand that if the keys are kept with Telegram, then anyone who access those servers can access the keys and therefore the unencrypted data. Haha. Touché Perhaps I misinterpreted the OP. It just came across to me that he is using the ol':
""If you don't have anything to hide... you don't need encryption"" argument. Implying that the reason people want E2EE is for nefarious purposes. The #1 risk to most users is the selling of data.  What do you talk about in your messages?  Google does it with emails.  They target ads to you based on the content of your personal emails.  They sell that algorithmic data to marketing companies.  Facebook, same thing.  Many other companies... It never ends.  Governments also... although not necessarily selling data, but analyzing it very carefully.  They can tell if you are left or right.  The data we generate unknowingly is being used in ways most people can't imagine.  

It is one of the biggest respects that I have for Telegram.  At least publicly, they have vowed not to do that to me.  And I appreciate that a lot. >Nothing I talk about is illegal, so why should I care?

It's not illegal yet. See how many people are now being shunned for having made a gay joke 15 years ago. Who know where the cultural Zeitgeist will be in another 15 years. Put it in your own words or copy and paste if you want. If you agree with it then make your own post with my blessing. The people behind Telegram seem to be good people trying to do the best they can for us, the people. I just hate that so much is getting posted attempting to discredit them unfairly. The question is, how secure is the device that the message received on?  Do they require a passcode to access the app?

I can see a possibility to anonymously post to a group chat in order to protect the privacy about the sender's information.  This wouldn't necessarily protect the message itself because of the liability of other devices that received the message becoming compromised.  Maybe possibly an extra layer of protection that required an end user to enter some passcode to view individual messages sent to a secret group message.  At least then a governing authority couldn't view the message without also forcing the receiving user to give up additional access information not stored on the device.  My mind could spend endless nights pondering the potential possibilities.  It is hard to imagine a true private group message that could guarantee the message cannot be read by someone not intended to view it.  It seems almost impossible to guarantee. It would require so many different levels of protection that it would almost make it too much of a hinderance to use effectively. Pretty sure it's just now tucked away in the three-dot menu? The one where you have the picture full-screen before sending and it's, uhh, upper left corner? I mentioned 2014 VK, so I was comparing 2014 VK with 2014 FB.  Personally, I loved the music and video sharing.  Especially the music lists.  It was like spotify integrated with the platform.  It was years ahead of its' time.  You could create your own music lists and even as you were listening to your personal playlist you could share it with your friends or publicly.  That is the main thing I remember.  I still have a VK account, but I rarely use it now.  A lot more copywrite regulations have been implemented and it doesn't seem to be the same experience anymore.  I liked the messaging system more than the FB system at the time.  It just seemed more simple and more logical to me.  It seemed less about generating money potential and more about user experience.  Personalizing your settings was more simple and straightforward it seemed.  FB has always seemed to overcomplicate how to do almost everything in regards to personal settings and they've always seemed more geared toward collecting data and generating potential money opportunities in regards to selling peoples' data.  Or at least is seemed that way to me.  I don't know, I just liked it more at the time. https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/kweovu/telegrams_pavel_durov_on_open_sourcing_serverside Good day lordhamster, I'm glad I could give you a chuckle. Yeah, I did consider that, too. Things can change a lot. The internet is still a baby; we haven't really experienced what it's like to have our every move preserved and dug up 50 years later. I mean... I think disappearing messages after a good 10 seconds is enough. Unless they really want a convoluted way of doing it where Telegram enables 2FA codes to access chats as an option, where the chat would then require said code after a variable amount of minutes set by the group. I know Microsoft Authenticator uses biometrics or a pin of varying numbers as another layer of security.

Honestly, any number of people can complain about how much better security can be. But at the end, even outside of Telegram, it's most often user error that fails security. At the end of the day, I just want Telegram to give decent enough options so that more people are inclined to use it. My circle of friends hasn't grown for both Telegram and Signal... Naw. At least on Android while in a secret chat that deletes messages after the set amount of time, to send a destructive photo you press and hold the send button for the options to appear.

The options just aren't there. Raised sending without message... Can't have a different timer for destructive photos in a secret chat :/ I have read that, and now? Disappearing messages are definitely part of the process to guarantee as much as possible that a message remains private.  But it still cannot guarantee 100% that a message remains private.  Even internet hosting companies won't guarantee 100%... it is always 99.9% at best.

I'm just pointing out this fallacy being spread around about superiority of one platform as opposed to others. Different platforms have different strengths and also weaknesses.

Telegram serves my needs and expectations better than others.  Everyone should decide for themselves. But blatantly false or misleading information about a platform to new users seems wrong to me. He has a good reason for not releasing server source code. They'd be more open to potential hacker attacks. It's quite a compromise. If it was open source more people could work on the code and suggest improvements.

Security by obscurity doesn't work, unfortunately."

Now, if we can just get you to stop using Skype and switch to Jitsi, the world will be closer to as it should be. 

I never had whatsapp. Facebook asked me to doxx myself back when they suddenly required full names to be used and I simply walked away. I wish my friends and family would ditch Messenger. My life would be so much better Welcome my friend! I still remember how I switched to telegram nearly a year ago! First I switched and started improvising my friends about its features and bots and much more! Got my friends switched there and I also made a college discussion grp in telegram where mostly out of 600 people 350+ joined there!(u knw only 256 can join in WA groups) So this happened and took 3 - 5 months, to be independent of WA! Now mostly my contacts are in telegram and I am comfortable using this service rather than using the FB sh*t!!The thing that I miss is Nada! For those who say WA Statuses, I'm sorry fck u! It has now become a platform to post unwanted vdo, memes and much more which is no one's business! Deleted mine last week! It was great. Lost some connections, but I am really not fond of Facebook (also left facebook several months ago).  Now on to instagram... I deleted it few days ago, few people called me asking what happened to me that I delete whstapp (as if i removed my internet existence completely). When I deleted wa, I told everyone they can either write me on telegram or old school text message me. Worked out fine.

Maybe that's helpful for some who still aren't ready for it I am almost there. I secretly hope that telegram will use encryption on regular conversation in the future. I can't throw away my whatsapp acc because of work and client communication, it would impact my income. But my whats signature reads ""Fast replys only on Telegram"". Anyone who wants to ask me something goes there now. If I need info from someone, I can tolerate whatsapp. Just deleted it too 2 weeks ago! Feels good man. I just deleted Whats App, instagram and facebook all three at once lol. Welcome to TG and Sgnl gang! That sweet, sweet smell of freedom! It's almost impossible in Brazil cause most services only work via WhatsApp. So if you don't have an account, it's hard to contact a dentist, vet and so on. Fortunately my closest friends and gf use Telegram, so I don't need to use WA so often. I wonder if they **really** delete all of your data on their end. [deleted] Wish I would reach that stage soon! I will also taste this amazing feeling next week I don't understand what you mean by 100% on Telegram and a little bit ton Signal? I never it into whatsapp My problem is there’s backup my whole whatsapp chats and read them after I delete my account Took me a very long while (almost two years). Had to switch the whole family first, then the friends, then the coworkers... I’ve done it like 3 times. Whenever I need to greet somebody, I create the account, type the number, speak to the person and delete the account right after. Signal is better than Jitsi as well, for videoconferencing up to eight people from a desktop computer or iPad. I don’t know about the video quality, I mean about the E2EE. I don’t know if Jitsi has achieved it yet It takes time but you can do it! The worst feeling when I first deleted Instagram was thinking that I'll be missing on something important... Turns out it's been a huge distraction in my life I deleted my Facebook account a couple of years ago.

In the time since, I've had four people contact me (via either phone or email) thinking I had died. lol

A lot of people really need to realise that Fabebook does not equate the Internet in it's entirety. Same haha!

“What happened?!” I'm in the same boat. I have groups for work but I wanna get rid of wa. How did you/woudl you go about this? If they do so, cloud sync would be gone As I said in an another comment, I’m not saying it’s easy and it took me almost two years to be able to do that. 

First I had the switch my whole family (that was the easy part), then friends and then my work environment (by far the most difficult, I had to do it one by one, supplier by supplier, partner by partner...etc). It's there a tutorial to to do that completely without left exposed data? It’s going to be a long struggle I know... Haha, I guess so. They mean they've completely migrated off of Whatsapp, and now use a mix of telegram and signal instead. I only care about my friends but most of them are lazy as HELL I’ve made the decision simple for them:
Either get Telegram, Signal, Steam-Chat or don’t message me at all.

It worked very well, but I’ve to admit that most of my contacts have already used Telegram You can do it much more easier. Create telegram/signal account. Send the link to important people in WhatsApp with message - “I am switching to telegram/signal messenger “ and delete your account. That’s it. Do it like Apple does. No choice for people) I'm following this same path, but starting with friends first. I plan deleting it in a matter of days.

Congrats to you! I also did that, but then you change job or partner and then again ""telegram, what is it? I only use whatsapp"" and they don't know you enough to say ""ok i will uninstall whatsapp and use yours, and i'll convince all my friends and family too"". Or maybe they'll install it because of your pressing but then finds out a few people of their circle use it and unistall it immediately ""i tried but didn't find anyone else"" wow you must be persuasive as hell My understanding is E2ee is more easily achieved when running your own server rather than relying on one of their publicly available servers, I seem to recall a RasPi4 will be plenty for that, with 4gb+ RAM. I don’t think so, my parents, even some of my friends don’t care about privacy at all, they prefer the comfort that Messenger provides. And of course they are too reluctant to change... 🤦🏻 I’ve deleted Facebook, Google and WhatsApp but I’m still going to keep IG for the time being...I’m not really into it (probably less than 10 mins a day) but it’s the last thing I have to be in touch with distant friends back in Europe. I think that's not giving others enough credit. They're not concerned because you're not on Facebook, they're concerned because you've dropped off of the default platform that was used for communication. I'd bet the majority of people don't even associate WhatsApp with FB - it's just how you message somebody. Apologising, saying I'm open to alternatives, e.g. Telegram or signal The whole point of Telegram is the cloud chat. Yeah I know. I wonder and forgive me if this is a stupid question. Could they have both systems and was the user’s choice if they will have the cloud or the encryption ? [deleted] Who did? OP or OP's contacts? Indeed, lots of people have also installed Signal. I’m not going to be the “Ditch Signal to Telegram” kind of guy so I’ve deleted my WhatsApp and now use mostly Telegram and also Signal. Yeah. I feel this. They even agree like ""fuck facebook"" yet ""they still want to use FB Messenger""

It's tough. A few times I got them using other stuff for a day or two and then they went back. :/ That’s the only way to make people listen. Just jump of the WhatsApp-boat. You just literally saved and made my day - thanks! 😂 Most users actually prefer cloud sync more No, Signal doesn’t have cloud sync. Reinstall it to see that you lost all of your messaging history [deleted] It’s not the same cloud sync, as with Telegram [deleted] Has at least one messaging app done Telegram-like cloud sync and e2e at the same time? [deleted] Signal doesn’t sync to a cloud, while Telegram does that, which is an important part of cloud sync"

Deleting that will probably solve your problem. If anyone has uploaded your contact  then i believe  you will get notification. Even signal also does that.

Few exceptions of course. Stop trying to conspire to murder other people and then you won’t have to worry about who of your friends knows that you joined Telegram after Parler got shutdown.

EDIT: Silence confirms guilt. Keep downvoting me without saying anything. People will find out who you are on Telegram. You should be worried. One of my my contacts is my sister, who also disabled the permission for the app to access her contacts, yet she got notified that I joined.

What’s going on here Thanks, l’ll try this!
But it’s so mind boggling why this sync contacts is still allowed to work even though I denied the entire app permission from accessing my contacts 😭 Mmm I can only assume that she denied the permission after telegram stored her contacts on the cloud. did she disable contacts immediately after downloading the app or only after using telegram for a while? You might have denied it . But others who use telegram or signal who has your number in their contact hasn't. So your number also got uploaded. But never mind its not a big security issue. Its just that that the notification is annoying at times. Hello, she only signed up yesterday and at the first instance that it asked for contacts permission, she didn’t allow it to access them.

I will try again with my brother’s phone, and if after denying access at the first instance on his phone I am still notified that he has joined then this is a massive problems Try and let me know pls, it really can be annoying"

Reason - e2e makes multi-device access VERY complicated. 

- Telegram’s cloud-backed model isn’t built to support e2e chats by default and that’s why it is even more complicated to introduce them for TG team.

- WA used to do it through over-the-network syncing (which needs your primary device to be on all the time).

Telegram is not E2EE by default. Thats difficult to take;2;kx1xu0;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kx1xu0/telegram_is_not_e2ee_by_default_thats_difficult/;29;"Hello, 

The problem - I have two different conversations going with the same person. Thats a silly user experience. Anyways, one conversation is a secret and the other is not a secret. Its generic. The secret conversation is E2EE. Great! but the generic convo is not. it can be compromised. I do not like this. **Why cant Telegram have E2EE by default and do away with duplicate convos.** 

This sub gets offended by this. In fact, as it stand. WhatsApp and Signal are way more secure than Telegram in that respect. I'm on the fence really. I really am. Telegram has the best functionality but when it comes encryption...It completely drops the ball. 

If you work at Telegram, please respond. Why have you done this? Yes you have many new customers but you've completely dropped the ball on people who understand E2EE (eg Snowden and Elon ) and are shifting towards signal.";2021-01-14 11:50:26;"Telegram is great because it gives you choice. If you really want something 100% secure, then use the secret chats, but it’s not convenient. If you want something more convenient (that is still relatively secure because it’s encrypted), then you use the classic chats. It’s as simple as that. You can’t have the best of both worlds. I like it, as the normal conversations are synced across all of my devices, so I can chat from any of them. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I still mostly use a tablet when I'm at home. The secret chats tie me to one device, which is a real pain for me. I believe it's difficult to keep the cloud element with E2EE, although I think Threema are working on implementing this. So it's certainly not impossible. 

Can't you just delete the normal(duplicate) conversation and only use the secret chat? E2EE makes multi-device access VERY complicated. 

- Telegram’s cloud-backed model isn’t built to support E2EE chats by default and that’s why it is even more complicated to introduce them for TG team. 
- Signal solves this challenge by using local storages on each of your devices - the challenge here is you can only access your chat history on a given device from the time of your first login on that specific device. This is why, Signal’s multi-device access falls short vis-à-vis TG. I think Threema does the same. 
- WA used to do it through over-the-network syncing (which needs your primary device to be on all the time). It also requires you to give WA permission to access your local network signal (not sure what this actually meant, but it was a separate permission I had to allow on my iPhone)

Threema’s [explanation](https://threema.ch/en/blog/posts/md-architectural-overview-intro) makes it a bit clearer. What's bad about choice? If you want automatic searchable backups of all your chats use cloud chats. if you want e2e use secret chats. \>  WhatsApp and Signal are way more secure than Telegram in that respect 

There is no proof that WhatsApp has any proper encryption at all. They do not provide source code of their apps (and apps' code is obfuscated) and also they don't provide instructions for [reproducible builds](https://core.telegram.org/reproducible-builds) Telegram has.

So while Signal might be more secure than Telegram, words ""WhatsApp"" and ""Security"" cannot stand in one sentence at all. It all depends on what the end user is trying to accomplish. If plotting a terrorist attack or sharing kiddie porn or some other nefarious activity, then secret chats are definitely the way to go, along with implementing other available options to ensure that both end devices are properly protected.

I think the general public falsely equates E2EE with an idea that they are more secure because of it. E2EE is only as secure as the security of both end devices. If either end device becomes compromised in any way, then the E2EE becomes moot and meaningless. If authorities confiscate and crack access to either end device, and other measures aren't in place to protect the app itself... then E2EE means nothing. Properly securing each end device is really the key to true privacy.

I abandoned Whatsapp a few years ago because I do not trust Facebook nor any government nor corporation. I have a great admiration for the efforts of Telegram to provide a secure communications platform with multiple options to fit different expectations of privacy. I have great respect for the creator and his real-world fight against authorities trying to undermine the general public's privacy.

I’m a network administrator with over 25 years’ experience, currently working at a university. I remember when the Netscape web browser was in beta. I don’t claim to be an internet security expert, as there are so many that understand much more than me. But I’ve watched the internet grow from infancy. 

I use Telegram to communicate with coworkers and my girlfriend. The most controversial things we might possibly discuss is about other coworkers or possibly some political opinions. In some countries this could possibly cause severe repercussions if publicly known, but I’m not overly concerned about it here in the USA. I use Telegram on multiple devices. I have it on my work computer, my home computer and on my cellphone. So I enjoy the convenience of the cloud based storage because it allows for my conversations to be updated on all of my devices. In a secret chat with E2EE, this is not possible. A secret chat will only update on a single device that I use. It works for me and the experience I want. 

I’m actually very impressed with the implementation of the cloud storage and usage of encryption along with CDN’s. Does anyone actually read the Telegram FAQ? They distribute encryption keys and message content across numerous servers throughout the world. Encryption keys and data are never stored together on the same servers. What this means is that no single legal authority can force them to reveal someone’s data. It would literally require multiple governments to issue legal subpoenas simultaneously after someone figures out which countries actually housed the data being sought. I think it is genius.

Read the FAQ thoroughly if you want to learn more. Pay close attention to the sections about their interpretation of what internet privacy means to them and also the sections about their policies and obligations of releasing data to governing authorities. There is an advanced FAQ if you want to understand their implementation of the encryption they use. Their source code is also available if you want to scrutinize their code. And for hackers claiming be able to retrieve a user’s data, they offer a contest with a $300,000 prize for anyone who can accomplish it. 

They have moved their base operations numerous times now because of threatening government regulations and are willing to move again in order to secure their users’ privacy. Great respect from me. 

Do your research, make the choice best for you. I’ve never used Signal and I won’t claim any superiority of Telegram nor inferiority of Signal. I have nothing further to add at this time. Because I want to use telegram on multiple devices. It is about convenience, I use telegram on a bunch of devices, I want my messages and files to appear on all of them. I also want to access my chat history when I connect a new device. That makes E2EE inconvenient since I would not be able to get the messages to a new device in an easy way. It is still encrypted though, just not end to end encrypted. If I were to discuss overthrowing governments or buying shady stuff I would use a secret chat. because that communicator is not privacy friendly like signal or even whatsapp, its more similar to messenger in this case, its meant more for ppl who care more about convenience -> keeping all chats on telegram servers to easily have a sync between them, privacy is sth they dont really care, everything is for ppl,

therefore it makes me laugh when ppl are saying ""i'm fed up with privacy things with whatsapp i will be using telegram' which in fact is more similar to messenger in this case, furtheremore whatsapp is better here having e2e encrypted chats with strong encryption algorithm(from signal), unlike to weak non-standard weird encryption used in telegram I have both under Signal, so having the best of both worlds is in fact possible. But the choice that gives you is very poor. I mean, what you only have is simple secret chats with someone else, not groups, that are not even synced anyway with other device, like occurs in Signal. I don't like Signal primarly because it forces you to share your phone number everytime you want to chat with someone, plus the UX is quite poor compared to the Telegram one. However, would be awesome to someday see improvements on the Telegram secret chats, that might make them more useful. Signal allows you to use multiple devices for the same conversation, all while being end-to-end encrypted, including ALL group chats. [deleted] If you back up your whatsapp chats you can say goodbye to ur super encryption 😐 So I can use Signal on my tablet? I still remember the story about a backdoor in WA: [https://signal.org/blog/there-is-no-whatsapp-backdoor/](https://signal.org/blog/there-is-no-whatsapp-backdoor/)

Whatever Moxie wrote there, this definitely looks like a backdoor and an intervention into Signal's OpenWhisper protocol. What piss me off is that WA really wants to u to back up your chats, every time you choose ""NEVER"" it will routinely ask you again in a few weeks, wtf Well it doesnt force you to do that, you have a choice , in case of telegram your chats are stored anyway on their servers with weak non standard encryption algorithm For iPads: Yes.

For Android based tablets: Not yet, but they are working on it. Secret chats are a choice too Ok thanks. I'm Android. Cmon it’s pain in the a* to use it I dont know man for me it's a pain having to take a picture of a qr code to chat on pc in signal you start chatting in telegram you need to start chatting, enter user settings choose secret chat then wait for that person to join the chat, if that person is not online i cannot send him/her anything, that is certainly a pain in the as\* You click on a user and press start secret chat and it's not true that u can't send messages if he's not online .... Well this is what current iOS telegram version is saying to me now I don't use secret chats that much, actually in 6 years of using telegram I used it twice (4 months ago or so) so I don't know about recent changes but It was completely as a normal chat only not synced It might be it has changed but from what you’re saying it gives even further proof that this should be enabled by default for privacy oriented communicator,"

>This phone number as a username is stupid.  It obviously doesn't keep spammers off the platform, and I can't keep my number private if I want   a new date or acquaintance to contact me.

The phone number is actually private to anyone who doesn't already have it, you just have to share your username ( @something ) to new dates or acquaintances and they will not see your phone number I agree completely here It’s intended, for discovery purposes, so you talk to your contacts using the app. 

The best way to combat is to transfer/create your account using a number no one has. you can obtain a Google Voice number in the US, or a plethora of apps that will give you one for free. 

But if you’re ok with not talking to any irl contacts via the app (except the contacts you add to Telegram manually), do this: 

https://twitter.com/wrdssn/status/1349178229140070403?s=21

>	go to settings > privacy > phone number > change it to “nobody” > change “find me by phone number” to “my contacts” 

>then go back to privacy > turn off sync contacts if it’s on > then delete all contacts (this is only needed if you turned “sync contacts” on, but it’s recommended) >I just don't get it and I don't understand why this has been an issue this long.

Well the simple answer is most people don't have a problem with it. Telegram has 500 million users and gained 25 million in the last few days. Users benefit from the network effect of knowing when their friends switch to Telegram. This is troubling and aggravating. I had a notification the other day that someone in my contacts had joined Telegram.  I deleted the message and had the option to delete it from the other user also. I didn't worry about deleting it for them as it was not a big deal to me, but it did bother me that the notification was sent in the first place. I actually hide my phone number and use the username feature to share how to contact me. It seems that Telegram betrayed my trust a little by notifying the other user that I was on their platform. 

I agree, it should be addressed. Block unnecessary contacts. And they won't know you're using it You only see them if you already had their phone number in the first place. They got the message because **they already had your number** in their phonebook. Even if there was no message, they would immediately see you anyway the moment they opened their Telegram contact list.

I agree that it should be possible to disable the announcement, but I don't see how it affects your privacy in any way. The problem is that they had your number in the first place, not that Telegram notified them of something they would've seen anyway upon opening their contact list.

It's like complaining that somebody who has your phone number can now make phone calls to you, or send you SMS. Or that somebody who got your email address can now send you emails. That's the whole point of them having it... you gave it to them so they could reach you.

In Telegram, like in all other modern messaging apps (WhatsApp, Signal, etc.), your phone number IS your identifier. And that is done on purpose, so that the network effect is as strong as possible, and the userbase grows exponentially, not linearly.

WhatsApp pioneered that method, and that's the sole reason they became the #1 messaging app in the world in no time. It would be stupid for any messaging app NOT to copy that, as that would guarantee their failure.

The only real solution for those kind of issues is to change your phone number.

Fortunately, you can just block the people you don't want to talk to, so it shouldn't be much of an issue in the case of Telegram.

Additionally, in Telegram you also have the option of giving strangers your username so you don't have to reveal your phone number to them. But if they already have your number, the username is redundant.

I really fail to see how this is a Telegram-specific issue though. If they had your phone number they could already reach you through many different phone-based methods. Telegram is just another one. Yup, that's the problem. I agree. Or at least give the option to block people \*before\* broadcasting to your contact lists that you joined telegram. 

There are certain people I'm not interested in engaging anymore, but they still have me on their contacts, and vice versa. This indeed needs to be fixed Completely agree with OP.      I don't want all my Hookers messaging me. I got downvoted to zero for asking why and how Telegram imported all my Iphone contacts at some random time. I had been spending time on the app over the holiday and found an old ""contact"" (spammer). I spent time blocking this person or persons. Within 48 hours, I phoned Apple for support with its email app. The representative asked me (why, I don't know) to open Telegram. I did. There was every single Iphone contact. 

I ended the Apple support screen share and turned off the app's access--which had not been turned on. Around the same time, someone whom Telegram should have had no clue whatever I had done (legal, G-rated) business with appeared in my contacts. This individual had never been in my Iphone contacts. I blocked the person, but each time I log on to Telegram, I see the name, and when I click on the name, Telegram asks if I want to send a message or chat.

I'll continue to use the app but don't trust it at all. I don't understand why my post was downvoted and got no response. Wtf, this is the same feature all the other messengers and providers have. When using Facebook they not only use your phone contact list, but literally scan your photos and find relatives/ people you indirectly know by that. 

And here you are complaining on the friend discovery feature you can control lol.

And blocking any contact literally takes seconds. Wtf. ""XYZ joined Telegram!"" * bans * I'm not sure if Telegram is automatically adding conversations between you and people in your contacts (and notifying both sides), or merely suggesting them, albeit aggressively. You can block users. but even if Telegram would not notify them, they would still see it if they scroll through their contacts..

as for coworkers.. don't you have a work phone/number? Oh okay, so you DON’T want people to know you just joined Telegram shortly after Parler got shutdown? Little suspicious don’t you think? Stop trying to conspire to murder other people and then maybe people won’t judge you. Just sign up for a Google voice number and use that as the verification number. One that you don't give out to other people so it's not in their phone book and you should be good. Good to know. The same is adopted by signal, why are they inheriting irritating stuff move to https://getsession.org ... doesn't have this phone number exposed issue. I'm getting messages from ppl i haven't spoken to in ages because of this problem. This! Oh yeah its intended.   Its a BUSINESS MODEL.    Money making by expansion.     They SHOULD be expanding via a superior privacy product. Thanks for the info, I really appreciate it, but the problem is that we have to do these gymnastics at all.

Telegram just really shits the bed here. Not all Telegram features and functions, are available, by using VoIP/Google Voice number(s), to register for Telegram. >It’s intended, for discovery purposes, so you talk to your contacts using the app. 

It's an unacceptable safety risk. It's such a low key fix to add a step in the setup process that asks if the user wants to broadcast a 'I'm on TG' message.

Twitter doesn't do it. Neither does facebook. Does WhatsApp? They probably didn't know it would SPAM their contacts, or look like it spams contacts, when they signed up for Telegram. A new user cannot do that until after telegram announces to the world that they're on the platform. They might have my number and be someone I don't want to communicate with. And vice versa. It's not privacy centric or very polite to do this without asking. But they see you when they have your number, regardless of whether or not you have theirs

Edit: lol someone doesn't like the truth Yes, you are absolutely correct; you failed to see why this is a Telegram specific problem, because you are blind to the fact, that Telegram advertises, that it respects and ensures it’s users, of their right to privacy and personal control of users privacy data.

Telephone numbers are private, individually identifiable personal data, subject to absolute control of the individual owner, it was assigned to.

No one, including, but not limited to Telegram has any right, to use theirs personally identifier for any purpose, without the prior expressed consent of that individual.

Those that violate others rights, by their ignorance are clearly demonstrating their hypocrisy and incompetence and can not and should not be trusted.

Telegram, Signal, et al, is therefore, untrustworthy.

Watch out, if they do this without first obtaining your prior consent, they will do other things, in the future also; it is only a matter of time. Suppose some kid's username is SmallTownGay2005, they're not out and their ultra conservative parents download the app. 

Just telling people that so and so has joined telegram, that they're *using* the app is the issue. It's inappropriate to do this without the consent of the user. 

I know why TG does it, it's good for TG, but sometimes not so good for the user. Right? Did you delet the contact of the blocked Person in Telegram?
Had this issue also that I blocked contacts but they still showed up.
So you have to delete the contacts explictly in Telegram, then they won't show up anymore. You cannot control the discovery feature. That's my point

As soon as you sign in to TG for the first time, your aunts, uncles, coworkers, school mates,  anyone with your phone number gets a notification that says aso_tora has joined telegram.

God help you if their ultra conservative and you're user name on what you thought was a private,  secret TG account is 'GayHackerista' or 'FurBoy2015.' I got a notification last night that 'Courtney joined Telegram.' I don't know if she got one for me, but I now know she's using this app. Whether she wanted me to or not.

I could call her husband and see if he knows... he's a conservative deck hand on an international ship. Maybe she's looking for someone to stir her inkwell since he's gone for 6 weeks at a time.

The fact that I know she's using TG is the issue. You are missing the point of the original topic of this thread.

Telegram, Signal, et al, is guilty of violating users data privacy rights, by engaging in unprofessional, unethical, willful misconduct and harassment, by being a busybody and broadcasting something, which serves, no legitimate purpose and is not essential.

Do not trust Telegram, Signal or anyone else, who does this to you and/or anyone.  They will do other things, to violate and disrespect you again, it is only a matter of time.

People and businesses, with integrity do not engage in such blatant disrespectful violations of others rights.

You have been warned. After you finish signing up with a virtual Google number you can disassociate yourself with that number right? And continue to use Telegram as normal without the phone number? Sounds pretty bad to get messages from people. Wait til you find out that groups can't be e2e encrypted.

/edit: downvote this fact, doesn't make it any less true. All Telegram account have access to all the same features. You don't magically have less features from using a VoIP number. Well, Facebook searches your Whatsapp contacts and suggests them as friends. It's not a great comparison.

But anyway I'm in favour of it as an option. I'm just explaining why they haven't done it. Right, but I'm saying the notification is useful to those of us who want our friends to join Telegram. Yes, but then you can throw them in the block and that's it. They won't be able to watch you True. There are any number of reasons someone could have your phone number. It could be someone you've broken contact with and no longer wish to hear from, but they hung onto _your_ number even if you deleted theirs. It could be your ex manager. It could be someone who acquired your number without your consent.

I don't think it makes sense to notify them that you're around without asking you first.

(Yes, I know. They'll see you in their contact list anyway. I get it. It's just... why make an _event_ out of it.) Exactly. I just made a post to this thread below. I used a flip phone when I registered--a cheap, dirt cheap, phone whose \[sic\] ""browser"" I have never used. Only after reading through posts here did I realize that a name I had used the flip phone for and that I have broken off contact with was imported into my Telegram contacts. This is bothering me more and more. >Telephone numbers are private, individually identifiable personal data, subject to absolute control of the individual owner, it was assigned to.

Again... Telegram doesn't EVER share your phone number with anybody. EVER.

It is YOU, the user, who has to provide your phone number to the other person first. **IF YOU DIDN'T, THEY WILL NEVER SEE YOU, EVEN IF YOU ARE BOTH ON TELEGRAM.**

Do you also blame your mobile carrier when your ex calls you?? After all, you didn't want them calling you!

>Watch out, if they do this without first obtaining your prior consent, they will do other things, in the future also; it is only a matter of time.

Without your consent??

[From their privacy policy, front and center](https://telegram.org/privacy#3-what-personal-data-we-use), which hasn't changed since they started in **2013**:

>3. What Personal Data We Use  
>  
>3.1. Basic Account Data  
>  
>Telegram is a communication service. You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.  
>  
>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your [username](https://telegram.org/faq#usernames-and-t-me) (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public. We don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.  
>  
>We do **not** require your screen name to be your real name. **Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.** This way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).

Again, because you seem to struggle with this:

**Telegram doesn't show your phone number to anybody. Ever. You have to do that yourself. The other person needs to have your number previously saved in their phonebook, which means YOU had to give it to them first.**

I fully understand that you might sometimes *regret* having shared your phone number with somebody, it happens to all of us. And that's what blocking is for. But that is YOUR mistake, not anybody else's. Once they have it, they will be able to reach you, just like they'll be able to email you if they have your email address, or pay you a visit if they have your home address.

It sucks, but you can't blame the means they use to reach you (SMS or Telegram, Gmail or Outlook, Taxi or Uber), when it was *you* who gave them your contact details. >Just telling people that so and so has joined telegram, that they're *using* the app is the issue. It's inappropriate to do this without the consent of the user.

If their parents download the app, they'll **see him immediately** in their Telegram contact list, username and all. That's how IM works in 2021, be it WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal or any other app. The notification simply advances the inevitable.

I agree it's a bit obnoxious, but it doesn't reduce your privacy in any way whatsoever.

>Suppose some kid's username is SmallTownGay2005

You don't have to set a username to use Telegram, it's completely optional. People will just see you with the **same name they have used to save you in their phonebook.**

It would also be quite strange for somebody who's not out yet to choose a public username that outs them straightaway, especially when a username isn't even required... \[EDIT: Just tried to Delete Contact. It didn't work. User still is in my Blocked User column.\] This is a little risky. If you end up not logged in anywhere then you lose access to your account as you can't receive the log in code. If you're logged in somewhere else the the code comes to your Telegram account first to pick up on another device.

Also, if you do this turn on the two step log on password feature so if the Google voice number is reissued to someone else they can't access your Telegram account. I knew that. That's not as potentislly dangerous. You are incompetent and irresponsible and do not know, what you are saying.

Ignore and disregard this incomplete and irresponsible “anonymous3355” redit.

Here is one example of Telegram’s discrimination and exclusion of Telegram’s users, that register on Telegram with a VoIP/Google Voice telephone number:

Said users are prohibited, restricted from and unable to create local area, location based groups. They haven't fixed it because fuck the user, that's why.

Does telegram harvest this info? Yes. However, now I have people who are pissed I blocked them - they know I have tg because TG snitches me out.

The user should maintain control over whether or not people know they are on the platform.

It's gross otherwise. No one, intelligent, and/or sentiment, buys any of YOUR IGNORANT, presumptively obnoxious, delusional “arguments” BULLSHIT.

YOU are OBNOXIOUSLY, PRESUMPTIVELY assuming, everyone whose possesses, others private telephone number, was disclosed and obtained by others, with prior voluntarily consent, of the legitimate owner.

NONE of YOUR arguments are persuasive or valid to support YOUR DELUSIONS and MENTAL ILLNESS which YOU OBVIOUSLY STRUGGLE with, on a moment to moment daily basis with.

YOU understand, NOTHING.

Telegram, Signal is being rightfully accused of unprofessional, hypocrisy, misconduct, false advertising and lacking integrity.

DO NOT TRUST Telegram, Signal, et al, even one second, they will do other things in the future, without your knowledge and/or consent again.

Trustworthy people and businesses, do not engage in ANYTHING even remotely resembling, what Telegram, Signal, et al has, already done to violate your trust and rights.

It will ALWAYS be inconceivable to MORONS (that means, Stupid, YOU Moron, DUMBASS “VMX” Reddit user) what the problem is, of this original discussion thread.

Reddit “VMX” user, DO NOT FORGET to take your PSYCHOTIC medications again.  DUMBASS. There's no indication to a new user that their username is 'public' in the sense that all your contacts will see it and your PIC.

There's lots of people sorting shit out online imagine if your coworkers found your Reddit account...

Annnd I just got a notification, on my second, 'secret' number that a coworker joined TG. No one has that number but my wife.

It's fucking amazing that this is 'normal' behaviour and modern users just roll over for this nonsense.

I'll have to start migrating to keybase or some other, privacy friendly, app. Telegram also syncs contacts with their servers, so you may be deleting the spammer and then redownloading the contact.

I revoked the little fucker's contact privileges.

I no longer recommend telegram as a secure, privacy enhancing, comms system.

I could accept their 'bespoke' encryption, but this nonsense is not something I can look past. 

It's skeezy. How is your conversation being readable by telegram and everybody who has access to their servers less dangerous than that people know you installed the app at one point? All you can do is set up who can write and see your phone number in the privacy settings. Man... are you ok?

I'm sorry for whatever you're going through... and I'm sorry I upset you. Hope it gets better! >Annnd I just got a notification, on my second, 'secret' number that a coworker joined TG. No one has that number but my wife.

Your contact list is the same if you have multiple numbers so there's nothing unusual there. It tells you if your contacts are online. What's wrong with that? I don't think you're getting it...

You're getting the notification because YOU have your coworker's phone number in the phone you're currently using.

If he doesn't have your secret phone number, he can't see you in Telegram, even if you can see him.

And if you go ahead and text him, he'll see your phone number but he won't know who you are, because he doesn't have your phone number in his phonebook.

Exactly the same as if you sent him an SMS. I follow a lot of people on Telegram but won't use it for anything else. Don't know what you mean by revoking contact privileges. The only option I have is blocking or deleting--neither of which work. Telegram employees have little to no bearing on my day to day life... where as family, friends and coworkers do and there's sspects of my life that I have a right to keep private.  That's all there is to it really.

A user's first experience with TG is long lost and possibly purposefully forgotten acquaintences, people who are part of circles you keep separate from others in your life are all pinged 'Dude has joined telegram.'

Their first user experience is a betrayal. It's shitty. Why'd you get so many down votes on that statement about TG no encrypting group chats? But as soon as you register and before you have any chance to do that, everyone who's already using the app and has your phone in their phone's contacts list is notified you're on telegram. Shut the fuck up, you piece of vile shit.

You have no power, what so ever, to upset anyone.

No one, cares that you are a dumbass piece of pathetic garbage.

Anyone intelligent, can see you have clearly demonstrated, you are a psychopath, desperate and starved for attention and permanently belong in a locked psychiatric prison ward.

Enjoy your perpetual Karma in Hell, Satan. I don't want them to know I'm even using TG unless it's on my terms. What about people that hack telegrams servers? Why did you switch to Telegram in the first place? Facebook employees have little to no bearing on your day to day life either I guess?

I am not trying to tell you you are wrong, please don't misunderstand me, I just don't get the issue. But you are right, it would be nice if there was an option during signup. I guess it's Telegram fanboys being big mad at me for stating a fact. I really really like Telegram, but security wise it's way behind Signal. Pointing that out isn't accepted.

Just to clarify: Group chats are encrypted, but in a way that the server (and everybody who has access to the server) can read your messages and view your files. There is no option to end-to-end (e2e) encrypt groups, which means that not even the server can read your messages. Yes. And they will see you. It's a messenger . It's for communication. 😂😂😂

More, more please! They won't because they don't have your number.

Obviously don't message them. Well that escalated quickly Indeed. Exorcist-level shit."

Telegram notification about somebody I know joining Telegram;2;kwu1ha;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kwu1ha/telegram_notification_about_somebody_i_know/;5;"A few days ago, I got a popup on Telegram about somebody I know who has joined Telegram. This in itself is not unusual. I get this popups often as friends of mine join Telegram. (Especially in the last few days as a lot of Whatsapp folks are leaving for Telegram or Signal)

The problem is, this is somebody to whom I have not spoken to in nearly 15 years.   Telegram did not exist back then, heck even Whatsapp did not exist back then, nor did Android phones!

Typically Telegram would tell me if somebody joined if their phone # is in my contact list.  This person is not in my contact list and has never been. Last time I had her in any contact list was when I was using Motorola flip phones circa 2005, and that was with a different phone # and even a different wireless carrier.

Since I did not have this cell # back 15 years ago, nor did I have this gmail account that is tied to my android phone how did Telegram figure out that I know this person?";2021-01-14 03:26:43;"WOW thats crazy I hope that happens to me lol.

New users should not have to have their telegram contact info broadcast to any loser who has their name and number in their contact list.

The potential for this to go sideways is huge. The solution is to not give anyone you know your phone number to ensure they never have the ability to communicate with you. This is indeed the preferred solution."

Looking hella dumb trying to prove a point...

Oh, privacy noob and Signal shill based on comment history. Nice. [It isn’t ](https://images.app.goo.gl/JJYsNJFvqxw74LwP9) As u/drashya [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kwnnsg/_/gjd8y1a?context=1000), that's not the same as the Apple app store privacy label

e.g. Signal can request location permissions so you can share location with someone, but that doesn't mean it's tracking and linking those to you. Signal does collect less data about you than telegram does, not to mention signal being e2e by default. i would say telegram is even worse than whatsapp when it comes to privacy, not comfortable secret chats which are the only ones realy private ones (e2e encrypted), its an alternative to messenger, signal is a different league [On Play Store it looks very similar](https://imgur.com/a/GUvgYzi) Yeah I agree, Whatsapp at least claims all of their chats are E2EE, and I'm inclined to believe that. Telegram doesn't have the server side source code open sourced; so it's pretty much as good as closed source. Telegram is using an inferior encryption protocol. 

That's not to say Telegram isn't great, I use it to host <2GB files, and it works greatly with that. But Telegram just isn't much better than WhatsApp, if not worse. Signal is the end game. well said You’re comparing App Store’s Privacy Labels with Play Store’s Permissions list. Two COMPLETEY different things. 

- Permissions list details the features of your phone that an app needs to work. 

- [iOS’ Privacy Labels](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/) make it very easy to understand the app’s privacy policy: what data does the app collect about you, and how does the app intend to use the said data [(more detailed description)](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/). To find this on Android, you have to click on the little[‘Privacy Policy’ hyperlink from Developer Contact. ](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2666094?hl=en#zippy=%2Cfind-an-apps-privacy-policy). 

I hope this clarifies your confusion? Let me know if I’m misunderstanding something. WhatsApp has their whole app obfuscated, server side code shouldn't be made public ... I don't know what you're trying to prove here all I see is you're puttin the Telegram on the same position as WhatsApp. You're using the same argument as everyone else about telegram, its like I'm unsure about Telegram's stand so I'm gonna use the app that openly screams about stealing my data Server side code not available doesn't impact security if end to end is implement client side and the client side has been open sourced and reviewed.

I admit that you might be concerned for non end to end but as stated elsewhere, it's not appropriate to open source the server side so you just have to accept it and use it (cautiously) or choose to stay on the end to end encrypted options If given the opportunity to use something like Signal which has every single aspect of it open source, or something like Telegram which acts more shady, I am more likely to opt for the former."
Is there any kind of security advantage to using signal versus telegram secret chat?;1;kwnikm;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kwnikm/is_there_any_kind_of_security_advantage_to_using/;12;"One argument i often hear against Telegram is that chats aren't encrypted ""by default"". I think this line of argument is somewhat fallacious as a secret chat can easily be deployed for Device to Device encryption. However im not exactly sure why telegram doesn't have device server encryption like Whatsapp does...

Anyways, Im just wondering. Is there any kind of security advantage for using signal vs telegrams secret chat function?

Thanks";2021-01-13 22:12:41;"Yes, secret chat can easily be switched on, but they can even more easily be left switched off so I tend to assume this is what most people will end up using. I could be wrong though. Absolutely. With Signal you can have e2e encrypted group chats. You can't with telegram.

Signal also has auto generated encrypted backups. - In TG, Secret Chats offer zero multi-device access. Also, you can’t do SCs on desktops (last I checked, may have changed).
- In Signal, multi-device access has a limitation that you can access chat-history on a given device from the date of your first login. But at least, after all your major devices are synced up - it works fine. Signal group chats have E2E video calls.

Telegram does not have E2E groups.

The fact that Telegram is not E2E by default allows them to move faster implementing features, since they can have the data on the server and do as they wish with new ideas.

When you are E2E from the ground up, you have to have much more considerations considering that the information only lives in the devices and you don't have them all centralized.

The tradeoff is features/development speed with known ways of implementing server side stuff, vs having to explore and discover new privacy lands on how to implement features, which is what Signal has to do every time they want to introduce something new. If private chats were on by default then they would not be able to use desktop messaging or have any chat backups. As the data is just stored on the two devices and if someone loses the phone then it cannot be recovered by that party.

That is why it is not on as standard, telegram wants to maintain usability and features whilst allowing those that wish to have a private chat to do it. Yes true, so it’s all about that compromise between security and usability then. [deleted] That first paragraph sounds like great features to me. Signal can do desktop messaging with e2e enabled. Your data can't be stored by some Russian guy if you encrypt everything. Yes signal is sooo cool, that's why everyone is using it... *Checks signal, no contacts* People tend to do what's easy, not what's best for them. Indeed, I need something that works, for all it greatness if no one installs it and use it, it's as if it weren't there at all. Telegram X alone has the same ""installs"" than signal."
In app browser settings broken / bug ?;0;kwnbca;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kwnbca/in_app_browser_settings_broken_bug/;4;"Hi peeps,

Can someone else test this also on their side?

Thanks

edit: Corrected Typo";2021-01-13 22:03:27;"Yes, I confirm that I'm seeing this behavior on iOS with the latest version of Telegram, as well. No matter which browser I pick in the referenced configuration setting, links always open in Safari outside Telegram. Looks like a recent ""feature"" that hasn't been thought through and was implemented fairly half-assed. It looks like a developer opened and then immediately closed a bug entitled ""Not possible to open link using in-app Safari"" ([https://bugs.telegram.org/c/770](https://bugs.telegram.org/c/770)) with the note ""This \[new behavior\] is intended to prevent webpages from closing (due to passcode) when the app is in background.""

I agree it was annoying when a webpage blew up or reloaded when Telegram got backgrounded, but changing the app to silently and confusingly (and alarmingly) ignore the web browser configuration setting if you have a passcode set is absolutely the wrong way to handle it. But this is not intended behavior at this moment.

The menu in the app explicitly stated that you have the option to select what browser is used...
I know that when you change the behavior you need to also update the respective settings..

The way it's set up now is confusing and it's a bug as long as they're not removing the menu options for this functionality Oh, I agree wholeheartedly, I'm just pointing out that the bug report was immediately closed by a developer with that ""explanation."" It's definitely still a bug."

In WhatsApp you can just click a sticker and ""add to favorite"" - you don't have to add the whole pack.

My friends and I have an habit of sharing trash humor memes as stickers, and more often than not, they're not part of a whole pack, they're just single jokes.

It'd be awesome if Telegram got that ""add to X"" (just an individual sticker, not a whole pack) feature.";2021-01-13 21:26:11;"I know there are bots that create ""your own"" stickerpacks. You send them the stickers you like and the bot adds it to your stickerpack. But I don't remember the name of the bot, if I will encounter one, I will add the comment. I'm pretty sure it's the official @Stickers bot. But I was looking at the possibility of adding stickers without necessarily adding the whole pack Well, yes, you can do that with Stickers bot, but with a bit more effort. The bot I have in mind automates most of the operations, it doesn't take more effort than adding to favorites.

Anyway, you can send the stickers from the packs without adding the pack itself, and the most recently sent stickers are saved in the top, making it kind of favorites, I guess. > Anyway, you can send the stickers from the packs without adding the pack  itself, and the most recently sent stickers are saved in the top,  making it kind of favorites, I guess. 

Indeed. That makes me think it wouldn't be hard to create a ""favorite"" tab. I wish I knew the programming languages used in Telegram so I could do it myself, but I only know a few other programming languages.

Muslim extremists have made use of telegram's encryption features for years. Almost all of my contacts that have joined Telegram in the last couple weeks are extreme alt-right Trump supporters that are no doubt jumping to a new ship because Parler got shut down. I’ve been messaging every single one of them to let them know that PRISON is also a good place to conspire or chit-chat about how you plan on murdering other people. Fuck them all, get them all out in the open. I’m writing down names and keeping track. I meant I don't believe all 25mn new adds in the last week are all right-wingers looking for Twitter/Parler replacements. No question they're part of that, but it's also people from all over the world fleeing WhatsApp. Yeah, I just don't have relationships with those kinds of people (certainly ones that would admit it), hence why I wouldn't be seeing them join. No doubt they are, though. Hyperbole much? Which is a stupid thing to say. ""Wait, you are *still* eating bread? Don't you know nazis eat bread???"" Sorry I don't follow you. I meant that is makes no sense to say something is bad just because Nazis use it. Nazis also ate bread. I was agreeing with you. Ah, ok.

[Use Signal.](https://i.imgur.com/dJORya5.png) But why not Signal SAME CAUSE I DONT TRUST THEM EVEN IF I DELETED THE APP MY ACC IS STILL REGISTERED ON THERE SO THEY COULD STILL TRY SOMETHING Due to What's App invasive policy update, It has turned to the dark side, ran by Facebook. While in real life Whats app is blaming no one. Telegram has gained 25 million users and What's App has no one to blame but themselves. I could be wrong, but i heard facebook is changing their privacy terms to allow them to advertise to based off of your whatsapp texts or something. We don't do that around here. Nope, I don't trust apps that aren't on Fdroid, thank you. Or ""private"" messengers based in the USA, lmao Signal is good. Edward snowden advocated for it. Signal has E2EE. Telegram does not. I've been waiting 5 years for telegram to add E2EE by default. I'm still waiting.

Strong encryption is a must-have if you want to call your app secure and private.

If telegram was E2EE by default, they would be the best app on the market. Currently this is up to debate. 

Go ahead and downvote me, because I know that criticism isn't welcome on subs like this (I know that, I'm an r/firefox user). because Signal doesn't have channels, bots, music, video editor and my contacts. Why would OP post Signal memes on Telegram subreddit? Because E2EE without anonymity protects nothing. Yeah, telegram doesn't even have E2EE in default chats telegram seems rather as an alternative to WhatsApp or messenger, in fact it could be considered even worse as it doesn’t offer e2e encryption by default like WhatsApp does,

signal is a different league for ppl who know what they want, certainly telegram is not meant for ppl who care about privacy Bring it on!! [You should.](https://i.imgur.com/Xw1Nt8J.png) Spoken like ignorant. And folder and 2x speed voice msg why would any logical person moving away from Whatsapp for the privacy issues choose Telegram instead of Signal. 

this meme doesn’t make sense That would be an amazing plotwist then why leave Whatsapp for Telegram Encryption isn't everything. Yes Signal is more secure by default, but Telegram has a lot (really A LOT) more features, and IMHO is a much better designed app Rather use secrets chats and all Telegram features than just a barebones Signal with just encryption. Telegram is also very privacy friendly, only thing it has is a thousand times more convenience over Signal and still provides better environment than Whatsapp or any existing chat app... it's only a matter of choice here... being a privacy freak alone cannot guarantee you privacy, you've to have some knowledge and I guess you've read the SC of signal before making all these claims It doesn't have e2e by default? What's the problem? Turn that on.

Your data is encrypted and stored on their server. It's the best practice and allows you to access your data from any device. You should get the fuck outta here If it's based in the US, it can't make any real claims to privacy. And if it's not allowed on Fdroid (Signal is NOT) then you have no idea what the software you're downloading is doing. It's basically proprietary malware at that point. [ironic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/kwnuh9/whatsapp_says_it_cant_see_your_shared_location/gj68eft?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) Because Signal is roughly equivalent to Telegrams secret chats.

Telegram has that, and additionally all of the other stuff Telegram has. For anonymity This. If you need to be more secure for a conversation, slip into a secret chat. >Telegram is also very privacy friendly

well i respect that somebody wants to use telegram over signal but lets be honest, telegram is NOT privacy friendly, like messenger, even whatsapp is more privacy oriented, having e2e encrypted chats, 

telegram has only those inconvenient secret chats, weak non-standard encryption algorithm, keeping chats on server, not fully open source, c'mon this has nothing to do with privacy,

but at the same time it has some nice features, lots of groups about all different bullshit, interesting but i dont use it, and those bots, although I didnt test them so far it’s THE problem for majority of users and most of them is not even aware of that, in another words telegram is not meant for privacy, btw turning on that secret chat is not so easy for many ppl..

keeping your data and messages on telegram servers with weak non standard encryption algorithm has nothing to do with best practises.. U too man, u too. Fuck out too. Again, spoken like ignorant. Lmao, gottem What irony? Your ignorance? You can’t use secret chats on any other client tho That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard Telegram is cross-platform cloud based sync app. It means you can log in to your account from various devices. With E2EE by default chats that were made on one device won't show on all of your devices. This is the reason why your chats are on Telegram's cloud. If you want secure chats, just enable the damn thing.

About ""Telegram's not fully open source""... Your software (if you're not using linux or android) is not open source either. Twitter, Instagram even this Reddit app all are not open source. Ok. Signal has e2e default. What do you get in return?

— No backups. Your chat history is gone once you uninstall the app.

— No username system.

— No fucking web app.

— No bots. Oh you don't need bots? That's because you never used them and I am in love with telegram bots.

— You can't hide your number on signal. You can hide your telegram number even from your contacts. In English we would normally structure that phrase differently. I'm not sure how it works in your first language, but in English that doesn't really work. Come up with a new catchphrase, please. I don't even care what people use but can u even argue against his points instead of calling people ignorant lmao Is that your best argument? Is that your best argument? lol are you even trying to defend yourself And features I use signal on iPhone, on desktop and on iPad and on all of these devices all messages are fully synced automatically and everything is stored locally e2e encrypted by default, not on a cloud server with weak encryption algorithm, so I have cross platform as in telegram with privacy by default, 
Those secure chats are inconvenient to use require another person to be online at that particular time to chat with..

Instagram or Twitter are not open source so? It’s not an argument, telegram owner refused to show backend side

The only argument against signal is that they don’t have apk available to download from fdroid but from their site directly although they have some arguments to back it up well if you don’t care about privacy of your chats than it’s no difference if you use messenger or telegram, best of luck with your bots I prefer to talk to ppl:-) i'm sorry but he's right you are a total ignorant :-) basically you have no idea what you're talking about Of course you'll get your messages if the app is simultaneously installed on all of your devices. That's the problem with it. You have to have it installed, when someone sends you a message. I can delete telegram from my desktop, chat on my phone and install it again on desktop. My chats will still be there, no matter what. [deleted] Right, and in case of signal if I deinstall desktop version and install it again I have messages synced from that new installation date, older messages are on a phone or on a backup,
so that’s a telegram advantage but still I think that signal option is much bigger advantage than that telegram one, at least for me, privacy comes first haha cheers:-) Well, I'm not arguing with that. If signal is your choice, more power to you. I just like Telegram, and gazillion features it has. I honestly don't know why Telegram labels itself as a messaging app. Sending messages is the least thing i do in that app :)"

Telegram is not safe. Why did you use?;0;kwguna;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kwguna/telegram_is_not_safe_why_did_you_use/;21;;2021-01-13 16:54:48;"If telegram can't be stopped/hacked by the russian government, that's all I need to know to trust it is safe😂 Literally everything you use is not safe, why do you still use anything?

Reddit sold out privacy from the get-go. I'm a simple man. Signal has all this ""security and encryption"" that I don't really care (at the cost of TONS of features that Telegram has implemented through the years) and Whatsapp is pretty much obsolete. When Signal or Whatsapp get the features I love, I'll make the switch. The federal government was hacked, no way telegram is safe Look at it from the GDPR... Everything is in Telegram's hands Signal is safe Then why was it blocked by russia but then, when they saw they didn't stop people from using it they recently unblocked it??? They even held a competition for people to try and hack it but nobody ever won Telegram is an app that is not super encrypted because they have the key for their servers, but that is not a reason to switch to signal, cause telegram has signal built within itself and it's called ""secret chats"". Secret chats are COMPLETELY ENCRYPTED but you won't have those chats in any other device, if you dont even trust telegram you can use secret chats, if you do trust them you can have all the comfort of using the normal chats. Your choice So is Telegram. You can't prove otherwise because they haven't been breached yet.

Just stick to Signal and delete reddit while you're at it. That sentence is gibberish omg, I think you're trying to say the Russians blocked telegram then didn't? What does that have to do with the ability to monitor and hack it? There is dozens of articles showing it is hacked and can be hacked but okay... Signal is US based. Are you honestly going to trust them? Telegram is not safe, secret chat is safe Omg sorry if I dont make perfect sentences in one of my 6 languages and no telegram hasn't been hacked, what's your info source? Your friends?

PS: the sentence is completely fine tf you want. They blocked telegram > that didn't stop people from using it > russian government gave up and unblocked it Then use something else... Wired and Forbes both reported it hacked in 2016 after your competition in 2014 to hack telegram. Your original sentence was not fine, ran on, grammatical errors and didn't follow the same tense yet I still tried to communicate with you. Chill They didn't hack telegram, they hacked their phone number and retrieved the 2FA code. Read news better instead of looking at my grammar 😒😒 ""In recent weeks, more than a dozen Russian entrepreneurs have seen their Telegram accounts hacked, in attacks that may have ramifications for anyone using the messaging app, according to firm Group-IB"" 

To get into their fucking telegram you half whit, they got access to telegram. You basically just said "" the patriots only won because of their defense"" no shit they still got it. Instead of focusing on how not being up to par for you, how about all you have to do is get the new device code for an unshakable system? Not very secure sounding is it? I read news just fine clearly. ""What’s particularly disturbing is that the victims’ messages were snooped on because codes used to authenticate users were intercepted by the attackers. In normal operation, every time a user logs in from a new device, a one-time, supposedly secret code is texted to their mobile phone. With that, they can access their account.""

Send the second part too you half orange, stfu and go to another subreddit, tf you doing here? You're LITERALLY saying that if someone can copy a bank's safe keys shape and use it to open the bank safe then the whole fucking bank system is not secure. Bro wake up, look at the downvotes, don't you feel dumb right now? Half orange? 

It literally says they can go through their messages, of course if some one can copy a banks keys its not safe, you have to secure the keys to secure access to the safe. My god that is a shit analogy. As far as down votes you mean the two I have got? I could give a shit.

I dont feel dumb, because they still had access even if you dont think it is a security breach they had access. They got in...period. Ok ok now tell me how can someone access their account by another device if not by a code sent to the phone? Tf they gon do to access it, recite an old norse magic? No that is how they would, but it also opens it to hacking which is how the hackers got in. Its literally what you quoted Holy fuck."

<link> No secret group chats yet, which is why he mentioned Signal for private groups. Those don't even work on multiple devices or on desktop, give me a break. Yeah but...

Their E2EE claims aren't very valid considering that the server side code isn't open source, and there's also the fact that the encryption they're using is an in-house solution called MTProto, while I'm sure it's not horrible, it wasn't created by cryptographers and upon analysis, fatal flaws were discovered. This is in great contrast to Signal's tried and true Signal Protocol, which even WhatsApp uses.

While I can see why people use telegram; I think it has a better desktop and UI, however it shouldn't at all be recommended as the 'be all and end all of security and privacy' when it's grossly lacking in those departments compared to the competitors. Here you go: https://i.imgur.com/7jnq5Gx.jpg Missed an accent. ""Contáctame"" Here you go: https://i.imgur.com/f0nUb5f.jpg Signal doesn't work on multiple devices either. Desktop yes but not quite so nicely as Telegrams cloud side (yes, I know, secret chats not at all); the desktop is just a phone link.

I'm lining up for a slating but yes, Signal wins on the desktop link vs no link. No, signal isn't as convenient generally and, for when I care, secret chat on one device is fine. Releasing the server code is useless as there is no way to verify if that’s the code being run by the server. Thank you! No necesariamente, en español rioplatense (Uruguay, y buena parte del este y el sur de Argentina) no se dice ""contáctame"" sino ""contactame"" (acentuación en la última a)

Fuente: soy de Buenos Aires we Omg thanks a lot!!! Signal has iPad linking, though (for example). Not relevant to me (I only have Android and Linux), but still relevant in general. They're working on usernames, which will likely enable multiple devices.

Most importantly, everything is encrypted by default. What you're saying is 'encryption doesn't matter', but when things aren't encrypted on the client-side, you end up needing to trust the server a **lot** more (as WhatsApp users are figuring out now). You can't just hand-wave and say encryption doesn't matter when it absolutely does. Right now, Telegram _can_ access your chats (although they **supposedly** make it hard for any individual jurisdiction to do so) and metadata. Whether or not you think that's a problem depends on how much you trust Telegram.

With Signal on the other hand, as long as you trust the clients (which are open source, like Telegram), you don't need to worry as much about the server. You may be able to trust the clients in both, but only one of the two requires you to trust the server (and it's interesting that the one that _requires_ trust doesn't have an open-source server...). Fair enough, I should've realised that before commenting on that, however, open source still shows that the company/organisation is more transparent, and will also allow you to self host it. ¡Cierto! I'm not saying encryption doesn't matter at all, that's a straw man that you've created. I'm saying I prefer to make the choice of client side and fewer features or sever side an more features. If you prefer not to have the option, but instead some other features (desktop/ipad linking) also fine. You can even use both apps, they're not exclusive."

[iPhone users GUIDE] Apple could delete Telegram from the AppStore, like they did it with Parler, what to do?;14;kwckce;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kwckce/iphone_users_guide_apple_could_delete_telegram/;46;[deleted];2021-01-13 11:44:37;"Apple won't delete Telegram. I don't know why people keep spreading this FUD. Why? Your phone company decides what you can or cannot have on your phone? 🤣 I love Android... Switch to android. Nah, there's no way Apple can just delete an instant messaging app because of some unsightly content, especially since they have moderators to clean illegal stuff up. Ditch Apple completely.

Same thing on MacOS with Big Sur, they can prevent any app they don't like from running.

1984 Yeah and they could delete WhatsApp etc, what’s with all this FUD? This setting only prevents the user from deleting apps, not Apple lol I don't use an iPhone, so I didn't know it, thanks for the tip, this post is hidden now.
It's WILD that Apple can do with their users' app.
And somehow it's still alive. What makes you so sure? Didn't they delete Parler based on users' posts inciting violence, or something about the platform being used by said users to organize violent actions? Couldn't the same argument be used against Telegram if those Parler users move to it? Just wondering Parler, it seems, allowed people to have their ""free speech"" platform. So, now that it's gone, there was a boost in users from the USA to Telegram. 

So some can imagine that Telegram might be next if they don't do anything about the fact that there are now fascist, flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers, Trump supporters, Qanon followers, etc, within the app. 

But that's definitely not the case here because Telegram already ban these kind of channels (with some sad examples that haven't been banned) off the platform. Also there's no feed to spread misinformation as easy (but it's possible), you won't see anything that you didn't, purposely, searched for. 

If you said ""Why?"" it probably means you know that fact already, but I'm repeating the message for those who don't. Yeah love android 😁 aosp I'm guessing, because if you are talking about pure Android from Google... xd Apple didn't remove Parler, Fortnite or Telegram (yes, it was removed a year ago or so) from the user's phone when they were removed from the AppStore. 

Android sends your location to Google every 4 minutes and constantly sends various metadata info to Google ads services. Apple sends location info only once a day and doesn't send any info to google ads services. The privacy options would be only ungoogled Android (and not Huawei) or Sailfish OS phone. >Your phone company decides what you can or cannot have on your phone?

Apple do not delete apps from devices if they are removed from the App Store.  You can't download them but if you already have them on your device then they will work Parler has mods too, but they got rekt regardless. This is a very slippery slope. >on MacOS with Big Sur, they can prevent any app they don't like from running.

Not if you disable Gatekeeper It's not hidden because I just found it in the regular list of posts! The instructions don't even make sense, why would settings for changing app deletion behaviour be in Screen Time settings?! lol

This post should be deleted, it's sole purpose is to try and cause panic in people Well the diffence is Parler is a social media platform which (by its nature) promotes popular posts. Just going to the website immediately hits you with extremist content.

If a new user installs Telegram they don't get extremist content. It's not promoted in any way by Telegram.

Also there's 500 million users of Telegram, it's a bit hard to justify blocking the app because some of them are insurrectionists. >fascist, flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers, Trump supporters, Qanon followers, etc

I love how you list a bunch of extreme conspiracies and then just casually toss in trump supporters with the list. Like 74 million people are crazy conspiracy theorists. Yeah lots of trumps supporters are also anti-vaxxers and qanon followers but its definitely a small percentage.  

It's like saying, communists, Nazis (National Socialists), Biden supporters, baby killers, etc...  Obviously most biden supporters aren't Nazis, communists, and most probably don't support full term abortions, but a small percentage are and do support those things. Also, I'm not trying to get all defensive here, just making a point that if both sides look at each other using the Extremists as the measuring stick, 2021 is gonna be 10x worse than 2020. Opposition blogs aren't going to be blocked, as far as I know; and there comes the decentralization perspective like decentralized Twitter, called Twister, but since people didn't pay attention, such apps' creators are stopping developing them.

Can you imagine situation where Telegram shows notification:""This channel/group chat unavailable since Google/Apple forbid us from showing it to you, if you want to see this content and you have an Android, download apk file from [telegram.org](https://telegram.org)""?

I'd download it :)

It does it for iPhone users though, many copyrighted channels can not be accessed through Telegram on iOS. Meh. Exactly! I love how they removed Parler from Play Store too. Lots of freedom there! We are talking about installing or uninstalling apps and you are talking about privacy? I have never said anything about privacy sir.

Plus,  can I get a credible link to this "" Android sends your location to Google every 4 minutes ""? I did not say ""They delete it."" I did say ""Can or cannot have on your phone."". They do not mean the same. When Apple removes an app from the store, you cannot download it. This is the ""cannot have"" part. They got ""rekt"" because they deliberately let the spread of misinformation and calls for violence happen. hahaha you frog... can you disable the gatekeeper on IOS?

stay in the boiling pot.

the writing is on the wall or should I say, the fire has been lit. Hmm, post indicated as hidden, will delete it >Well the diffence is Parler is a social media platform which (by its nature) promotes popular posts. Just going to the website immediately hits you with extremist content.

I think what you should focus on is the fact that they host content, which Telegram does too. Thank you for the explanation Actually, Telegram has filtering for some channels on Apple devices and you cannot open them. If some software allows users to view content that is prohibited by Appsrore rules, such software should filter this content Well that's not android, that's google (yes i know android is owned by google). You can still have Parler on your android phone, just not via the play store. That's a whole different story with iphone. Yes, we are talking about installing and uninstalling apps and i answered that Apple won't delete Telegram or any other app from user's iPhone. Also, anyone can use web version or telegram or PWA in the nearest future. 

I started talking about privacy because you recommended to buy an Android phone, but it spies on users much more than the iPhone does. Apple doesn't sell data and earn money on ads, but Google does. And imo it's better to use the web app or PWA of the Telegram then provide all your life details to Google.

There is a link to research: 

[https://digitalcontentnext.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DCN-Google-Data-Collection-Paper.pdf](https://digitalcontentnext.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DCN-Google-Data-Collection-Paper.pdf) Wow, what a charming twunt you are This is one way I differentiate Signal and Telegram. Signal, the content only lives on your devices. I see it more as a utility than a service, if that makes sense. I'm not sure what your point is. When they (Apple) remove apps from iPhone, they don’t force delete them from user’s devices either. I live in a region where recently a lot of apps got banned. All of them work on phones they were installed on. The government had to get the apps servers blocked to make them stop from working (they were stealing a lot of data, so I am glad they blocked the servers). But yeah the apps kept working, though they were no longer downloadable on the phone. i like frogs... they are beautiful.. I don't like people eating frogs. That you're letting your political clout, impede your logic.

Whether you believe they are insurrectionists or not, the fact is Apple and Google, decided that a content hosting service, regardless of message is improper and blocked it from their services.

Telegram fits in that category as well. Ah i see, i have no knowledge about apple being able to remove apps from their devices, and if they can't thats great (although i understand from OP that they can?). I was merely commenting on the fact that on android you can always install any app you want (for example Parler), whether google wants you to or not. So the settings outline in OP's post aren't necessary? Again, Parlor promotes content from popular users on their front page, Telegram does not. It's easy to see why Google, Apple and Amazon consider it a violation of their ToS. About sideloading: There are ways to do that on Apple too. But it requires a mac (iTunes backup and restore). The only thing Apple has so far force-pushed (twice) are critical security updates. No. But if you follow them, you won’t be able to delete any app by accident (the UI options to delete apps disappear after taking those steps). So this entire post is nonsense. I've seen it spreading around social media too. That’s the problem. People see a point where they can diss at Apple, and they won’t let the chance pass. I use both Android and iPhone and each has its own strengths and weaknesses but the misinformation around Apple is way higher for whatever reasons they may be!"

You have to be able to access the text messages sent to that # inorder to access the telegram account. [Here's an example of how easy it is. With an attack that its called an SS7 Attack](https://youtu.be/dkvQqatURdM)

[And here's another. ](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) Can you explain how sim interception work? Even after 5 years? It's still that easy? The easiest way would be social engineering, you convince someone at the cell phone provider to activate a new sim for that line, pop that in a new phone and away you go.

While you definitely should using 2fa, secure passwords, etc. This kind of attack is targeted, ie, someone or someones try to gain access to a specific account. The easiest way to help thwart this kind of attack is to use a gvoice or other burner # along with 2fa, etc. Wait, one of the signs if my sim has been intercept is that there's no more signal bars, and I can't text or call, right? That's not what I said.

If you have no reason to think that you are being targeted, those are signs that either your service has been disconnected or your sim card needs replaced.

Again, while you should always keep opsec in mind and secure your accounts as well as they can be, taking over someone's phone to hijack a telegram, twitter, etc account is a targeted operation. Unless you have a reason for someone to want access to your chats with your mother and whatever porn you've subscribed to I wouldn't worry about it. Sorry, but I what I meant is that "" losing signal bars"" and ""not receiving or sending messages"" is one of the signs that your sim was intercepted, right? Again. NO. It's a sign that there is an issue with your phone, the nearest tower or your account.

https://core.telegram.org/techfaq Y tho! Thank you for your response. I appreciate it. 

I'm not a technical person. I got lost reading through it. However, finding out that Telegram has a standing unclaimed reward for any party who can tell them any vulnerability is really a huge confidence booster for me. 

Thanks again. 👍 According to what Telegram says that is. We would never know for sure. It limits the very features people use Telegram for [deleted] [deleted] How do you know that the open source version of the code is running server side?

You can verify telegram mobile apps installed on your phone are the same as what's in the open source code.

Signal, despite being open source, does not allow 3rd party apps to use the system. Why is that?

People put way too much importance on server side code not being open sourced when it still involves a huge amount of trust, regardless of service. Oh. But would you still recommend Telegram? It's also about editing messages and message history sharing for new group members.

Also, in Signal, when you install the app for PC, you can't see YOUR OWN previous messages present on your phone. [deleted] [deleted] I agree. But that does not mean that what you see in the source repo is what is running on their servers. The fact that 3rd party apps, that conform to the protocol, are not allowed on the signal network is very suspect to me.

Your last question? No, unfortunately, you can't edit messages with e2e encryption :(  
I'm not a cryptography professional, but it seems that you can't share the previous history with e2e encryption either, since it is not implemented in any e2e messenger. [deleted]"

Secret chats are end to end user encrypted. All tg communication are encrypted. You're just confused on the terminology I think. either signal, or encrypted chats are i think Great.. Why not have it by default and not have two seperate UI conversations with the person...Ridiclous and not sure why this subs get offended by that. Secret chats work only on mobile devices, unfortunately. If your sim card is compromised, your telegram chats can be accessed. Im not confused. E2EE should be the default. I shouldnt have two conversations going with the same person where ones a secret and the other is not. Thats confusing and really just a waste of space. Both signal and Whatsapp have it by default... What about keybase? I'd say if ""they"" are on your phone, you've got bigger issues.

Of course, if ""they"" want on your phone, ""they"" will be on your phone. But that's another discussion... That's a design choice made by telegram and they clearly explained why they made that choice.

It's so funny to me you think by saying something is ""e2ee"" that you trust it as secure. You can't verify the signal app on your phone is the same as what's in the public code repo. In telegram you can.

And whatsapp, that's a joke. Not secure at all just because they market itself as e2ee its anything but safe to use if you care about your privacy or private conversations."

It is not. It is a common misconception. Telegram doesn't have default encryption, so I doubt you have at least one encrypted conversation. Furthermore, they do not have peer to peer encryption even if you use their ""encryption."" Telegram is relatively safe if you set it up properly and understand how and what is encrypted and what is not. Telegram is a hybrid secure messaging/free speech social alternative. The former is secure with exceptions. The latter is not secure at all as excessive security protocols would defeat the very purpose of a public facing channel. Telegram is a Russian government project. You can see it by investigating the media support of it. See publishers and their connections to Russia.
Telegram is not safe in any case. It is featured but transparent to its real owners. So you keep pretending that there are no Secret Chats. Pathetic BS.

You know the headquarters of telegram are in Dubai, right? Looked around and found nothing regarding this information. If you can find a source, please link it to me.  i heard that the CEO of telegram and putin have had conflicts and putin, putin overthrow the internet in russian then telegralm move to another country,i dont think that telegram is a russian gov plan Sounds just as safe as any other app. Tbqh I'd rather support the Russians than the Chinese. Researched this and it's true. Telegram HQ is currently in Dubai. Still safer than WhatsApp in my opinion. [Recent example](https://www.rt.com/russia/512269-telegram-downloads-surge-trump-ban/). I believe you are the Telegram troll too. But why? We have Signal, Matrix, WhatsApp at least. Whose of them are Chinese? You are using tools from murders, and you are OK with it because, in China, you have even worse bastards. An excellent logical conclusion. You must be fun at parties. ... Do you not think China are also murderers? > We have Signal, Matrix, WhatsApp at least. 

WhatsApp is the whole reason I switched to Telegram in the first place. Facebook is being integrated to take more data so no thanks. WhatsApp? Seriously? The reason that Signal and Telegram gained so many users lately is because of how fucked up WhatApp is going to be. It uses end2end encryption though. American companies are no go for people in the West. Chinese and Russian companies may not be safe for dissidents in China or Russia, respectively, but they are far safer alternatives for people in the West. Everything is relative. A Russian owned company owned by a guy who by all appearances seems to be a free speech zealot is the best of all possible worlds for someone in the West. Even if Pavel is some secret FBS shill, Putin isn't going to drop the dime on us to Russia's enemies. Yep, supporting spyware of murders and criminals is fun. Of course. You are a troll. You were asking me about your statement, not mine, as Russian trolls do. Facebook doesn't kill people. And you can avoid using Facebook at first. Yep, I gave you three apps that are supposedly better than Telegram. It is simple to check Telegram connection to the paid Russian media. Other messengers were not exposed in it, at least. You can just keep thinking whatever makes you happy, I guess. Facebook takes more data than anything that I know so far. You're clearly too hateful about Telegram and your opinion doesn't matter anymore to me. Thank you for your time. yes ok. Telegram may not be that secure, but WhatsApp won't be either. So Maybe Signal is the answer. I know the question. You don't. Or you are a paid commenter. Signal does not have all the features of Telegram, unfortunately. Please reply to me with something more relevant to my question. I can tell you have a profession at assuming things about people like:  


People are spies, paid commenters, and Telegram Trolls.   


Please, grow up and be more professional. I only asked if Telegram is safe nowadays, not some story about murders or whatever the fuck happened. Discord goes through this shit as well and I still use it to this day so please, be more professional and give me something actually relevant to my question next time. Yeah I know. I use telegram a lot and took me ages to convince people to switch to telegram. Telegram is really fun I love it but when it comes to privacy it’s tricky. If you are not a troll, read my first message, where I was much calmer.

Just search for news about Telegram, find ""sources,"" then investigate them. I did this job a year ago. A very unreliable media publishers created all media fuss.

My behaviour was not kiddish. I know this subreddit and how many trolls are posting here. So if you are not one of them, check the information twice, think.

The telegram was not a safe messenger anywhere. Not before, not now. It doesn't have encryption in all your groups, channels, conversations. It doesn't have any safety audits, and it is not open-source software. It was developed in Russia in the company where FSB has the major seats at the time.

Do not believe the propaganda. Use your head. What can I say else?

And the last, though. This subreddit is biased and not the best place to ask this question. If you want to know the answer, you should ask it in r/Privacy or somewhere where fewer people are from the Telegram community.

BTW, the possibility that you are a troll is high. I wouldn't say I like trolls or people who believe in propaganda. Your misleading question about Chinese murders was from trolls' arsenal. The statement in your first post about everything in Telegram IS encrypted, which you even typed in bold, is misleading. Just think if you are not one of them. And shame on you if you are. ok boomer"

Telegram is bottom out of the three when it comes to encryption. It does not encrypt groups chat or normal conversation by default. This worries big time. Additionally, telegram seem way more open than WhatsApp.

There would be a mass migration if it had end to end encryption by default. The app is actually really good compared to WhatsApp in terms of UI. 

Convince me otherwise.";2021-01-12 20:31:51;"Telegram does use encryption. Just no E2E. 
One question. Did Telegram's encryption ever been broken and messages were leaked? What are you complaining? Yes, Telegram does not encrypt conversations, but take a look at what this brings to you: seamless multi-device experience; always store conversations in the cloud to eliminate the need for backup. When it comes to security, WhatsApp will upload your backup content to Google or Apple if you enable backup, which is also unencrypted; and Signal hardly provides any practical backup function unless you use Android and are willing  to perform manual backups regularly and move backup files manually to somewhere secure. I have never understood why anyone would want to backup their chats. One of the reasons why the un-overheard spoken word is the gold standard of privacy is its transience. I aim to simulate this in my chats; that's why I always use the self-destruct timer on Telegram. I don't want people to be able pull out something I said 5 years ago and quote me on it. This bit, to me, is almost as important as encryption. i know that everyone mentions e2e at first, but ... telegram supports multiple clients to be connected, so if the e2e would be active, how to synchronize all the messages through all devices?

transfer key between devices you say? so if anyone breaches to my account, than he gets the key and can read all the messages, so what's the point?

&#x200B;

secret chats have true e2e encryption, which means not synchronized between devices

i personally have no problem with the e2e by default thing. if i need true e2e i turn on the secret chat. i prefer multiple clients (phone, tablet, pc, notebook,..), it's more important to have synchronized all the devices

&#x200B;

on the other hand, telegram doesn't communicate unencrypted, at least TLS is encryption and as far as i remember there was a bounty to breach the telegram, was it paid off? was there any breach? i am not any sort of ""you must use telegram"", use whatever you want, whatever you prefer, it's up to you guys and it's called freedom :-) Private chats use E2EE What is the issue about it not being e2e by default?

The real issue is that you can't e2e group chats even if you want to. > Convince me otherwise.

no one will convince you, if you dont like it use signal or keep using whatsapp Telegram has fantastic UI & UX but they suck on privacy because they're not E2EE by default which for the privacy conscious is a deal breaker. Yes, you'll be downvoted but you're right I dream, I dream that someday people understand why Telegram isn’t E2E everywhere. But not, they’ll always repeat what others say without understanding 🙄 Exactly. Completely agree! Signal has automatic backups. It produces encrypted files which can be auto-streamed to cloud backups if you want to. [deleted] Its not the best user experience really. Whats the point you having two chats with the same person. Just set E2EE by default lol???? Can I get an explanation for that one? You can activate e2e, so why is having a choice a problem? Surely a privacy conscious person would activate e2e?

Imo the real dealbreaker is that groups can't be e2e encrypted. I am not a cryptologist, they say E2E is safer and I believe them. Telegram, because it does not use E2E, might be a little behind of others in terms of security. But since it did not got hacked, I do not mind. Telegram's core features are based on not having E2E and that is, frankly, more convenient for me. Without understanding what? Please explain. [Have you read this?](https://graph.org/Why-you-should-stop-reading-Durovs-blog-posts-11-25) pretty neat solution, hypothetically sending 1.5G file (actual limit on telegram, afaik) to user, who connected from 4 devices (like me - phone, tablet, pc, notebook) and every device offline, means, that server holds 6G of data, waiting clients to download. wiping some device means, file never downloaded and remains on server

everything has its cons and pros. I know that solution would be automatic deleting messages after certain amount of time

but still, wiping device without correctly unregistering it means tons of queues on server, which are never used, so the simplest solution no e2e by default I delete the non-e2e chat, so I only have one. Good thing is that you can also delete the unencrypted chat on your contact's device, so if they're too dumb to grasp the concept of a secret chat (which is at least 50% of people in my experience), they won't be confused. >  *You can activate e2e, so why is having a choice a problem?* 

The question is why would you, the user, not want E2EE by the default? Why would you not want privacy? You actually want *less* protection? And why does Telegram make it a choice?

The way you present a choice can heavily influence what choice you make. Telegram knows that. 

Look at the organ donor systems. In most countries it's an *opt-in system*, meaning that organ donors have to sign up to become an organ donor. In other countries, they have an *opt-out system*, meaning every adult is automatically an organ donor unless they opt out of of it. Guess which system creates more organ donors? The latter ie the opt-out system. 

Telegram could have also made E2EE by default with the option to opt out. That would have also given their users choice. But they deliberately didn't because they wanted to influence your use of the app in a certain direction.   


The fact is, the vast majority of Telegram users don't use secret chats. Telegram knows this. Making it a choice, and an opt-in choice at that, makes it far less likely that people would use it. 

Telegram wants to grow their user base fast, by offering the most attractive user experience. For some reason, they don't think they can do that with E2EE by default, or they don't want to because it's too hard, takes too much time, and would slow down their growth.   


Signal has a desktop app. Just like Telegram. Is it as cool as Telegram's? No, but it works great and is E2EE. Signal has every emoji, sticker, gif, end-to-end encrypted. Telegram does not. Even in secret chats those features are not E2EE. Keep in mind that those features are potential security and privacy vulnerabilities. 

Any messaging app that is not E2EE by default cannot claim that they committed to privacy or that they are as good or better than any other app that is E2EE by default and collects zero data & metadata.   


> *Imo the real dealbreaker is that groups can't be e2e encrypted.* 

If you're ok with Telegram having the ability to read your private message to friends and family that's on you. But know that they can.   


The fact that Telegram is not E2EE also makes them more vulnerable to government organizations like the NSA & GCHQ. Yes, this. Not having E2E makes it more versatile. Need E2E? Open a secret chat. [deleted] You wouldn't want e2ee by default because it makes backups much easier. Telegram gives you the choice: If you trust them you can have your chats backed up for years on end on their servers. If you don't trust them but want the features then you can use secret chats.

>If you're ok with Telegram having the ability to read your private message to friends and family that's on you. But know that they can.

I said it's a dealbreaker!?

>The fact that Telegram is not E2EE also makes them more vulnerable to government organizations like the NSA & GCHQ.

Secret chats are e2e. Suppose most of your Telegram contacts and the people you communicated with the most on it, would only text with you via secret chat, under every circumstances, even if it's to talk about the weather. Would you accept? like I always say ""everything can be done, but it's matter of time/money/resources"" >*You wouldn't want e2ee by default because it makes backups much easier.*

Why are you saying *you,* as if  you're not talking about yourself. When I asked you my question, it was addressed to you personally. It was not a collective you. 

>*Telegram gives you the choice: If you trust them you can have your chats backed up for years on end on their servers.* 

I already told you about the bias inherent in the way Telegram presents that choice.   


The keyword here is *trust*. As I said in a previous reply Telegram expect us to trust them on their word alone instead on  the strength of their encryption.  That's ridiculous. 

Clearly you trust them, but I don't. 

> Secret chats are e2e. 

Yes they are but most users don't use Secret Chats, hence promoting Telegram as a secure messaging that protects privacy is deceptive when most users don't use that feature, and it's not by default. I guess I don't understand your question. I basically only use secret chats. For the weather I'm not sure if I would bother. But virtually for everything else. I have 30 secret chats open in my phone right now, two groups and two unencrypted chats. [deleted] My bad, I misread that.

> Telegram expect us to trust them on their word alone instead on the strength of their encryption. That's ridiculous.

Absolutely.

>Yes they are but most users don't use Secret Chats,

That's on the user. If you don't have 2 min to read the settings of an app you use then I have little sympathy. How is my question not clear? If all your Telegram contacts only wanted to speak in Secret Chats would you accept? It's simple.  I think you get it.   


When I say ""the weather"" I mean mundane thing. You basically only use secret chats? Does that mean that you use it more than non secret chats? don't be, i kinda understand, why there is no e2e by default and just writing my developer's point of view
i also understand why are people mad because there is no e2e by default, but alternatives exist and if there were no alternatives, we would be satisfied with the one and only, say Facebook Messenger and we all will close eyes on data sharing, because of lack of alternatives

you know what i'm trying to say? I agree. If you can't wrap your head around the concept of a secret chat, you cannot really care so much about privacy after all.

I think this whole argument is like saying that cereal isn't a good breakfast because some people pour the milk first. >*That's on the user. If you don't have 2 min to read the settings of an app you use then I have little sympathy.*

u/einfachweitergehen This is where I disagree. It's not entirely on the user. It's mostly on Telegram. As I said numerous times now, the way Telegram presents the choice is deliberate and biased towards you being less likely to use secret chats.

WhatsApp is is E2EE by default. That fact alone makes it technically more secure and private than Telegram.

As you know, backups are not E2EE on WhatsApp, and that's a deliberate choice on their part. WhatsApp knows that most users use backups and has been criticized by Telegram and others for misleading the user.

One could say ""*if you don't have 2 min to read the settings of the app and disable backups, I have little sympathy for you""*.

If WhatsApp is at fault for not making their app truly private by not having backups E2EE, then Telegram is also at fault for not making chats E2EE by default.

You can't have it both ways. You can't blame Telegram users for not making Secret Chats the default chat, and not blame WhatsApp users for not disabling backups to have privacy.

Either both Telegram and WhatsApp are guilty of not protecting their users privacy, or neither are.

One could even argue that WhatsApp has the stronger position and is therefore  more secure than Telegram privacy wise, because they are E2EE by default and **you have to** ***opt-out*** **to** ***disable*** **it**, whereas Telegram is NOT E2EE by default and **you have to** ***opt-in*** **to** ***enable*** **it.**

WhatsApp backups are not enabled by default, you have to turn it on. Meaning that the user has to turn E2EE encryption OFF for them NOT to be protected via backups.

Historically, ***opt-out*** **systems** have a far more successful  adoption rates than ***opt-in*** **systems**, because in the opt-out system, the users are automatically signed-up. They don't have to do anything. It requires zero effort. They have to elect to opt-out which does require effort.

Whereas with opt-in systems the user has to elect to adopt a feature, which requires effort, and makes it far less likely they will do it.

Both WhatsApp and Telegram know this, and by that metric, WhatsApp is better and as result more secure than Telegram when it comes to privacy.

Telegram could have made secret chats the default with the ability to opt out and use cloud chats. Instead they made cloud chats the default with the ability to opt-into secret chat.

That decision was deliberate because they were aiming for a specific result, ie people using cloud chats more.

Right now, every time you start a new secret chat you see a pop up from Telegram telling you that all your messages are E2EE and that you have privacy.

What they could have done instead is make secret chats the default, and every time you start a cloud chat, you'd get a pop telling you that this chat is absolutely not private, that they can read it, and see all the information and data you share within int. But they didn't do that.

Personally I prefer Signa's system where everything is E2EE by default, with no option for chats that are not E2EE.

However, had Telegram had a system where Secret Chats are the default, but you can opt-out with cloud chats in the way I described above, it would have been far more secure than the system they have now.

Their current system is objectively, and by your own standards where the user is at fault for not reading the settings, weaker than WhatsApp's. Well, your question for one thing is needlessly wordy and grammatically convoluted. But mainly I didn't understand it because I did not understand your intent. I don't see how using secret chats is ever anything that one can object to or not accept. But anyway, the answer is yes. And I already gave you a breakdown of the chats on my phone in my previous comment. Tagged you and replied [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kvw8fy/lack_of_encryption_on_group_chats_has_me_in_the/gjq2anj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) If you've used secrets chats then you should know that both parties needs to accept. You can't just start a new secret chat without the other party consenting. You have to wait for consent before you are able to text. Never seen or heard about that. Your interlocutor only has to be online to exchange keys, but this takes a split second 90% of the time. I have never seen a ""do you consent/accept"" dialogue pop up. Ah they must have updated how Secret Chats work. Before both parties had to consent.."

Nobody's blocking you from using Telegram on any desktop OS really Huh. So ReactOS is still around? Interesting. For real I need to run telegram desktop on a computer that it’s blocked does anyone knows how to do it? are people really taking ReactOS serious? Саша, этот ваш выкидыш операционной системы с большими проблемами запускается даже на VM, но ты продолжаешь рассовывать его во все щели по интернету. Зачем?

Linux свободный, работает и(с Wine / Proton) даже виндовый софт запускает. Windows закрытая, работает и тоже софт успешно запускает. Microsoft технологии понемногу вскрывает(недавний опенсорсинг куска DirectX, например), чтоб софт портировать проще было / сама делает Linux-версии(SQL Server, например, который использует собственную реализацию winapi поверх POSIX, чтоб не переписывать) и весь реально используемый софт скорее запустится на Linux с их помощью, чем на React OS, которая до сих пор не реализовала полностью совместимость с NT 5.2 двадцатилетней давности — это как если бы во времена семёрки вы бы недо-DOS показывали.

Я видел треды, где обещается поддержка windows-драйверов, но на практике, опять же, всё работает только в VM. Влажные фантазии о том, как всякие древние ЧПУ за миллионы денег перейдут с XP на ReactOS, потому что швабодка, разбиваются о суровую реальность, в которой заводу проще заплатить за поддержку EOL-софта, чем проебать дорогое обородование, потому что управляющий компьютер на наколенной поделке ушёл в BSOD.

Есть множество хобби-ОС, которые являются такими же игрушками(хоть ColibriOS), но ни одну из них не пытаются с упорством шизофреника пропихивать в реальное использование / включать в конкурсы на гранты / искренне защищать, как полезны продукт.

Что вами движет? It's running perfectly on GNU/Linux. And I don't know how you can use ReactOS seriously. half meme half serious I guess. I'll try ROS again it is reality :) TOS does not have network stack, so... I've seen it run Windows in a VM so I can't imagine it wouldn't run TempleOS as well! lol and coming up. Those Linux distros never die honestly Blocked? Like you don’t have a password? Just reinstall the OS [deleted] uh, wdym? The spirit of perseverance and curiosity is what drives us in search of opportunity. yeah that is wath i was thinking too, why using reactos instead using any linux distro? [deleted] React OS isn't Linux based though is it? The VPN is blocking it Gentoo Linux? To run over my windows? I felt most preferred Linux to it ReactOS is not a Linux replacement, it is a Windows replacement!

Not everybody could switch easily to Linux from Windows. If you are already happy with Linux, then good luck to you! NGL I misread your original comment. Somehow I missed the word ""on"". I was thinking yeah sure, I've seen ReactOS run VMs no problem! But your comment is completely different... 

Running Telegram on TempleOS in text-only mode would be amazing If the problem is the VPN, you are screwed, unless you use another VPN to bypass or a mirror, that I don't think telegram has. it's been  years since it's developed and it's very limited on daily usage, that's my point of view, anyway i appreciate the work and effort and passion on that project If there is anyway to run an explorer with a proxy I can run telegram I don't know your infrastructure, but you can set a proxy on windows or on the browser itself. Can you install [Opera](https://www.opera.com/es-419)? If not use the [portable versión](https://www.opera.com/es-419/computer/portable). It has a VPN inside, maybe could work. The problem is I don’t have admin rights, I can’t install another browser and I can’t change the proxy settings that’s why I need to find a workaround You could see if they did a shitty job, try to access the website using the ip instead of the URL. No they did a good job the IP is block as well only when you introduce a proxy you can enter You could DM @stoopingams on Instagram, message me You might need a portable browser that you can configure a proxy

That's a win on my book!. Fuck whatsapp! Great news We just made the switch today! > 25 million new users in 72 hours

aw fuck the Parler refugees are here 🔥🔥🔥 This is probably almost all white supremacists fleeing Parler. Is trump banned?

If my weed dealer didnt insist on it I'd delete this shitty app now.

Oh and now you got some new Fed and LEO users too! Youve truly hit the big time now. But also, congrats to the WhatsApp team. Telegram couldn't have done it without them There’s no second world anymore.  We are all living under America now Na.. Whatsapp's privacy policy is Telegrams and Signal's gain. People are signing up in droves Parler was a niche shithole, I sincerely doubt they even had 1 million users, lol. You do realise Trump got the largest ever Hispanic vote a republican candidate has gotten right? That’s a whole lotta “white supremacists” with more melanin. So salty about the app that doesn't even make any profits... I'm curious, what messaging app that's better and more feature rich than Telegram are you using? Same with Parler fugitives

Disclaimer: Im not welcoming them here, just stating the fact they heavily migrated Third world accurately reflects the fact they their country was left out of both the second and first worlds sphere of influence, which is a pretty good, although not perfect, indicator of how the country has developed. 

And America has pulled back on the world stage in recent years. I would argue more countries are touched by the tentacles of China than America as if now. What exactly are you trying to argue, that white supremacist Trump supporters don’t exist just because Trump got more Hispanic votes than Mitt Romney? Lol Nobody has spread the left extremist lies as much as Trump did, so making Hispanics afraid of the ""communism"".
Saying Hispanic community shares the ""values"" of Trump is a huge insult to all Hispanics. Salty isnt the quite right word and I wasnt pissed about any profit aspect in the first place. I was already on edge and maybe didn't need it spelled out to me that there are 25M+ murderous neo nazi types around the world. Send the fucking pop up the new users not everyone wtf

This was shitty timing and incredibly tone deaf given current events. [deleted] Yeah as if it wasnt obvious Brian Williams just specifically told me He got 50% of the hispanic vote and 20% of the black vote. Thats way more than Mitt Romney would ever dream of. [They also seem to be changing their views to conservatism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_conservatism_in_the_United_States) The 25M new users aren't coming from Parler. Parler was tiny.

They're coming from whatsapp, which has 5 billion users. Don't worry. They hate nazis and terrorist too. They've been treating some of the groups the same they treated ISIS. And the greater part of the 25 million refugees comes from WhatsApp, since they updated their privacy policy to share all data with Facebook. Parler itself had had only about \~1.5 million users in its final days, so it's practically impossible that all of the new users are from there.

And it's not tone deaf at all. Not everything has to be about america. No one wants them but this is literally where they came from. Tons of other messaging services, especially signal, got a huge influx since the insurrection kicked off the ban wave. Grow up. Don't you guys effectively have a two party race?  

Doesn't that mean that the other guy almost necessarily would've gotten ≈50% of the ""hispanic vote"" and ≈80% of the ""black vote""?

Also propaganda is a hell of a drug, especially when the media is basically captured, even partially. Tribalism, too.  
I personally know stacks of people who vote against their own interests all the damn time, and I'm not even referring to the US when I say this. They've always been socially conservative. Don’t speak for the others. Telegram is for everyone Most of them would have come from Whatsapp when they updated their terms of service. That was a global thing, and that's how you get 25 million new users. Fuck off > Don't you guys effectively have a two party race?  

> Doesn't that mean that the other guy almost necessarily would've gotten ≈50% of the ""hispanic vote"" and ≈80% of the ""black vote""?

Of course it does but if you had better reading comprehension skills you would know that wasn't my point. I wasn't comparing comparing Trump's voting constituents to Biden. I was comparing them to Romney. >They've always been socially conservative.

But Trump's values are egoism, sadism and narcissism. He has misused the conservatives for his personal purposes ever since.

Look how his republican opponents talked about him when they fought for the president candidacy in 2015/2016. They said he is a pathetic liar and has no values. And they were right so. But the republican basis fell for Trump (their ""Große FÜHRER""). And after Trump was voted candidate, the others turned 180° and l\*cked Trump's a\*\*. I’m not trying to make telegram an In Group but I’m never going to be welcoming of people who have been kicked off of Internet forums because they or the communities they were a part of were supporting an attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election. The problem is, most people don't care, and of those who care, most probably weren't using whatsapp already I don't know who any of your guys are. I'm 100% the uninformed one here, but that's not on my ""comprehension"".

The US just doesn't factor enough into my life enough for me to know enough about it. I generally know the president's name and that's about it, but I also know in detail how your election system works.

Assuming Biden is the blank slate that just won your last election (I think that's the name of the new Democrat President?), why does Romney (whoever that is) come into it or matter? Was he the previous guy? Democrat, Republican or something else? The why chats are private. Don't look at the maga messages and it won't hurt you Right most people don't care, but Whatsapp has 5 billion users. A tiny fraction is still 25 million."

Signal needs your phone number for registration.
And I guess something is stored, as you can recover your account. But don't @ me. Also, it uses your number with contact-syncing, or at least you can't disable this. I really can’t find any difference between Signal and Telegram when registering.. both need my number and contacts and you can use a false name on both too.

The reason I love telegram because it’s what me and my girlfriend are using plus VKM bot which let’s us download music for free lol So they were expecting Signal to come out better than every competitor, but they saw it's actually the same as Telegram only with 1/10th of the userbase, and decided to fake the chart? In general, I think everything now collects users' data and daily habits. Telegram also stores your location if you don't disable it (the new people nearby you function) and they save your chats.
Also, you can find out where people live using the people nearby you function.

Yeah, I'd too rather use Telegram than WhatsApp, but it certainly isn't more secure because your chats are stored in a readable format on some server.

That post will probably get downvoted but idc because that shows that there aren't any arguments against it.

Edit: Signal stores your phone number and account information too so the chart is not correct. Neither for Telegram nor for Signal. I was thinking the same thing.

First thing it does is ask for a phone number.. They do need it, but they don't build a profile off your number. At least that's how I have understood it based on comments from others. I mean I even installed Telegram again recently with a new sim card and I didn't even give Telegram permission to contacts and it works fine. All it needs is phone number and nothing more. My non-contacts can't see anything even my phone number because of my settings, and there's zero contacts there because of me not giving the app permission. I don't understand this stupid chart. You can deny access to contacts and manually add a conversation. That's just not true, I love telegram, but it definitely doesn't hide your user data. Basically anything is send to their servers and the big difference to signal is, that nothing is encrypted. Signal even encrypts your contacts. Your post will get downvoted because it's wrong. The People Nearby function is disabled by default, you don't need to disable it unless you enabled it yourself. It's off by default If you look at the chart, that's not what it's showing. It's not talking about whether the data is encrypted or not. It's simply pointing out which data each app accesses.

The chart says that Telegram reads:

* Your name
* Your phone number
* You contacts
* Your User ID

I'm not sure Telegram really collects your name. As far as I know, you don't have to provide a username to use Telegram. But the other 3 are true.

Then it goes on and implies that Signal collects... nothing? How the hell does it let other people know that you have Signal? Doesn't it read your phone number, your contacts, and a user ID, exactly the same as Telegram, so you can actually use the app?

I agree that Signal is slightly better than Telegram in terms of privacy, but the chart above is simply false. Weird, I contacted some people that I got their address using the nearby function and they said that they didn't even know it's enabled. But maybe they activated it without realizing it, so ok.
Also, the function is very unsafe due to the accurate distance that's given.

And what do you say to the other stuff I mentioned?
It's not very secure to save all your chats in a cloud without encryption. Even WhatsApp uses E2E in every chat. Of course you can create a private chat, but I want privacy in every chat as a customer. Funny that no one addresses the other things I've mentioned I think the chart is showing data specifically linked to you, which is why it doesn't show anything? I guess your contacts, phone number, and whatever else aren't linked to you specifically in signal but in telegram it is? Hmm not sure. I mean, I don't know how your phone number and your contact list could NOT be linked to you... Yeah, the chart doesn't make much sense, I think it's grabbing from Apple's list that they have on their app store but I'm not sure."

Sparing 'Secret chat', can this thing to enable encryption on command be implemented? Why or why not?;2021-01-12 12:05:09;"I think every option for customization is better for app&people.

I'm sure Telegram will introduce that feature in near future, but since many people don't have a technical background, they'd enable that feature and left without even noticing many good perks of cloud chats on which Telegram engineers worked so hard.

This is not about unwillingness, Telegram users are not ready for such kind of option yet. Telegram uses client server encryption rather t he an client-client or e2e. Difference between Telegram's version and others is that telegram uses a protocol called MTProto which has not been cracked till date, and it uses a distributed infrastructure where decryption keys are split amongst locations, so data is more secure. This gives you the advantages of cloud chats with more security than traditional methods atleast untill today and there have been several people trying to crack telegram chats such as the right wing in Russia as telegram is used by left wing activists in areas like that and have been unsuccessful so far, so it looks to be secure, and much more so than WhatsApp for te near future Desktop would need to be updated -- it does not currently support E2E encrypted chats. Wow! That sounds great. The issue is, e2e encryption is not synced, that’s why Signal and Whatsapp require you having your phone with you in the same network at all times to even work.
Frankly I like the versatility of Telegram, if I want e2e/secretChats I can use it, but if I want synced messages across all my devices I can have it too."

Advice for beginners. Enable additional protection of your account. But don't forget your password!;91;kvlms0;Telegram;https://i.imgur.com/PIKr0xW.jpg;15;;2021-01-12 08:48:59;"This can't be stressed enough! Get yourself some 2FA to protect your account! I'm still kinda annoyed that this isn't required to be turned on. Anyone with access to your sms, can get into your account and basically read all chats. 

Now this sounds like a weird scenario but there's one plain example: the government could try to log into your account, intercept your sms, get the code and then login.

But there's an even easier way, because network operators normally wait 1 year before they hand out the same number again, when someone deletes their contract. But, if you have set your account to delete after 1y of inactivity, forgot to switch numbers in tg, and the phone operator messes up with the 1y deadline, what could happen very easily because humans are lazy and will easily mess stuff up, this person could try to register in telegram, but instead be logged into your account and see all your chats.

I have a friend who works at a companies business phone departure where they've handed out around 10k business phones, and each number they get back, they wait for 6 months, because that's the normal account deletion time for whatsapp and telegram, before they give out that number again. But if someone changed it to 1 year in their settings, theyre basically screwed. 

This is such a big issue imo and probably the biggest security risk telegram really offers, not having 2FA enabled by default. Sure it's a PITA, setting up that password then never needing it again, but you also have to set up a recovery mail nowadays, so it should be fine imo Too late. I already forgot my password. Thanks memory loss. Just turned mine on!  Almost wish it would have been an option like sending you a code that you'd access in your authenticator app of choice or via another means like other accounts do, but this also works! . Agreed!  And I do it on EVERYTHING!  And for 2FA on any account, if you can, use an authenticator app instead of SMS codes. https://i.imgur.com/5TDpq7A.jpg In Telegram there is such a still convenient function. Which though not significantly but helps Is it possible to login same account with old removed number? I used my account with old sim, deleted it after new sim. Can anyone enter my account with the old sim even I am removed it? Confidentiality above all! Not to sure how authenticators work so this might be a stupid question: Doesn't that open you up to the authentication-server giving the keys to people with access? If you use googles authenticator, couldn't they give the keys away? Or is everything local on the device? Sure but if this person is not logged in currently, not in the reach of their phone, busy, whatever? It's too late lol. I knows there's some factors that should protect from that but yea.

Or let me be a bit more explanatory with the situation of my colleague: he normally gets the phone and sim returned from the people who work there. If someone installed telegram on their business phone with that number, without 2FA, he could just take the Sim, insert it into his phone, add the tg account and would be logged into her account, without her knowing and have access to all her chats. 

If he'd give the Sim out for another colleague because he requests a new phone, same situation. 

If you lose your phone, someone finds it + SIM and you're currently nowhere near a device where you're logged in to tg and removed your SIM pin, he can log into your tg as well.

These all seem to be very specific cases, and sometimes need bad luck, or more like bad human decisions involved, but these things do happen and with other chat clients - nobody would see any chats whatsoever. On telegram on the other hand, this person has access to everything.. it's scary tho, and it could be stopped by just forcing 2FA, what should really be a thing for a 'secure' messenger that tg often is claimed to be. Nah, if you switched number you should be fine. It's just, if you haven't switched number, then anyone with a Sim of your number could potentially log in to your account (under some circumstances), so always enable 2FA (and check currently logged in devices under security in the settings somewhere) Well yes. This must be included."

5. Also in the same settings page of Privacy and Security, go to Groups.

6. Set ""Who can add me to groups?"" to ""My Contacts"" as well to avoid spam where literally anyone just adds you to random spammy groups.


Why Telegram does not enable the above settings by default, I do not know. It will give new users a much better experience to not let them be exposed to Telegram's entire community where spam is a thing. While you can't do anything about people that already had your number in their synced contacts when you joined (other than blocking them when they message you), what you'll want to do is set who can see your phone number to 'Nobody' and who can find you by your phone number to 'My Contacts'.

you'll find those options: Settings > Privacy and Security > Phone Number 

You can still set your name, profile pics/vids and bio to whatever you like, but without a username set and with your phone number discoverability set to only your Telegram contacts, only those contacts should be able to find your account. Thanks and yeah, you're so right. These settings should be enabled by default. Thank you for the info. Have a great day!"

Now with the flood of people it's getting extremely annoying. Is there any way to disable that? I really don't care who joins.

\*Edit: some are telling me to do what I *already did* (turn off notifications). What I want is a way for it to **stop creating new chats for people that just joined**. Apparently the only way is to delete my contacts from Telegram (which is something that I don't want to do). Really, the only thing I don't want is to open Telegram and there being 5 new chats of ""contact you don't normally chat with through messages just joined!"".

In other threads I've seen people say ""then don't use your phone number to contact people, just tell them your username"" and the thing is: I did, but I was flooded with bots and spam accounts sending me messages, which stopped as soon as I deleted my username. So apparently there's no solution to this right now.";2021-01-12 02:53:17;" (In Android) go to Settings -> Notification and Sounds -> Events -> turn off ""Contact Joined Telegram"" Delete your synced contacts? You don't need people in your synced contacts to be able to chat with each other.

Settings > Privacy and Security > Delete Synced Contacts

Also, make sure to turn off the 'Sync Contacts' option first if you go this route. Doesn’t look like there’s a way dude. It is fucking annoying and I’m afraid there’s nothing we can do about it apart from just disabling notifications for it, which you’ve already done. Oh i just got it 😅 so you don't receive a notification but you receive ""someone joined telegram"" massage anyway.

Yeah apparently you can't stop that
It's probably gonna stop at some point tho

Umm. As i mentioned, your newly joined contacts doesn't notice that you received their ""joined telegram"" massage. So it's not a bother for them. And they don't know that you have their number.
For you however I suggest making a folder for Personal chats (which is already a recommended folder if you go to folder options)
So that it wont bother you that much.
OR you can stop syncing your contacts ,(in privacy settings) and wait a few days so that all of them join. In Notification and Sounds, under Events turn off 'Contact joined Telegram' The thing you mentioned about bots and fake users spamming you... 
Bots normally can't start a chat with you. 
Telegram has very strict rules about spam accounts. So please do report them Swipe left in Android they will go straight to Archive. That's not what I mean. I already disabled the notifications for this, but my chat menu is still filled with ""new chats"" of people that recently joined. That's what I was afraid of. Well, I'll just have to manually delete them as always. Hmmm maybe a folder would do for now as a temporary alternative. I hope they disable this in the future. That's not what I mean. I don't get notifications for this, but my chat menu is still filled with ""new chats"" of people that recently joined. Well, maybe not telegram bots, but certainly fake users. I did report them and block them when I had a username. Oh i see. Can't you just select your conversations (by touch and hold on one of them, then touch the others ) and then choose delete? Yup. Tbh i didn't even thought about it. But yeah... Better to have an option for disabling that. That's what I've been doing, but I just don't want them to appear at all, like on other messaging apps. They're not going to appear again, since you disable that option .

Also they won't be notified that you received a massage like that. I think I'm not explaining myself well. I don't receive a notification of ""Someone joined Telegram"" because I disabled it but when I open the chat menu, there are new chats automatically created for the newly joined contacts. I delete them, but with the new change in WhatsApps policy a lot of my contacts have been joining Telegram, so every time I open the app there are new chats created for the contacts that just recently created new accounts. That's what I want to disable, the automatic creation of new chats when a contact joins. I have many local businesses' private phone numbers, so I get many new chats. And even when it wasn't this frequent it was still annoying. Sorry, You mean groups? No, I mean individual chats for each contact. [Like in this image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yazmk.png)."

So let people choose, like:

Europe, Asia, Russia - Telegram

America, Canada, Australia - Signal The US fucked over their bid for cryptocurrency, so I'm not surprised they don't like it. Besides, the US is too intimately entwined with Facebook and its products, maybe they consider it a lost cause. Although I'd say that's a shame, I'm sure tons of US users are going to ditch WA. When Durov was kicked out of Russia, he wrote that Telegram wasn't really meant for the Russian market, and he even outright refused to translate the UI into Russian (but did it for numerous other languages).  After some years, after the app got crazy popular in Russia despite the ban, seeing such popularity and devotion from the Russian people ,he warmed up to the Russian userbase, the app is officially translated into Russian now and Durov runs a version of his personal channel in Russian.

Can't help seeing some similarities with the US now where the US government fucked up his major crypto currency project and he lost all hope of doing business in the USA (I remember he once considered moving their base of operations to the US). He's got a good thing going on. He really shouldn't try and aim for the American audience as he suggests. The popularity of Telegram in USA can be a weapon of Double-edged by the laws that exist in this country, when certain application or company takes enough critical mass in USA, they can make you sell the local operations as they are doing with tiktok, IMHO +1 Durov I'm not sure that's a very winning attitude. It's one thing not wanting to market the app or to pander to a specific market, but another to say you don't want to be popular in a certain country.

In some of his interviews, and here in this comment, Durov comes off a bit self-righteous, and I feel it can hurt his project a bit.

I feel you could either have offered an explanation or phrased that better, if he didn't mean to appear arrogant. Everything he writes will constitute PR for the app, and this isn't the best possible PR to have. Durov actually knows what he's doing. He really does. China - WeChat

Japan - Line

Hello Telegram";2021-01-11 19:30:00;"Bye 4 real!  It was long past time. 5 years ago still 😂 Same Same boat, man, just made the switch and still trying to figure out what this app has and doesn't have. Seems pretty similar to Whatsapp so far? Ditto They will miss us for sure👌🏼 * Polls (super useful when getting availability dates or voting for activities/restaurants etc)

* Stickers (I think Whatsapp copied these a few years later)

* Huge groups or channels (where people can subscribe to see messages but not post themselves. See Pavel Durov's channel as an example)

* Editing messages (not sure if this is now in Whatsapp), and deleting messages without leaving an obnoxious bubble that says you deleted a message.

* People being able to add you without you giving them your phone number

* Proper desktop and web clients that don't need to piggyback off your phone's internet connection, so you can forget your phone at home and still be able to contact people.

* 2GB file sending limit, and unlimited storage in your personal 'Saved Messages' chat. I love the function of pinning messages in a group. Pretty useful when you have a file, a link or something else that everyone wants quick access to in a group chat. This way it doesn't get buried when the conversation continues.

You can also tag messages with #tagname and click on that to open all messages with the same tag. Very useful to be able to edit older messages in groups, so you can re-tag them.

Not exactly sure, but it felt also like files load quicker in TG. Also music and video files had more problems in WA in my experience. Often times videos couldn't be displayed, GIFs cannot be imported (you have to use their built-in GIF tool). And for some reason I was always anxious when playing audio files on WA, because it has a bug where under certain circumstances the volume suddenly jumps to 100% for a second, which always gives me a heart attack (and deaf ears).

The only thing I like better about WA is that you can batch more than 10 pictures together (at least I don't know how to do that in TGX). If I send 100 pictures, it splits it up into 10 messages, while WA is able to put them into one. But then again, WA doesn't lump pictures together if its less than 4 pics, while TG can (it even lets you choose). >Stickers (I think Whatsapp copied these a few years later. massive groups

Pretty sure Viber was one of the first with stickers? (that one's quite popular in Russia)"

I found a way to do it and I actually made it  
just search for   
Facebook\_Feeder\_bot

I am anti Facebook and I hate it so much for a looooooooot of reasons so I decided to delete my account , but unfortunately Facebook  monopolize the content  specially in my region as Facebook is very popular and forums is something from the past now :(

so I decided to build this bot to help me continue following some posts I like

the main idea of this bot is to help you avoid checking your newsfeed every single moment for updates !!!

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer :**

    THIS BOT WILL NEVER ASK YOU FOR YOUR FACEBOOK ACCOUNT INFO , you don't even need a FB account to use it !
    I don't even use Facebook API in this bot.

Features :

* Facebook will never know your identity as everything is done on server and the bot just fetching the post to you.
* you can subscribe to Facebook pages using page ID (@bla bla bla)
* you can subscribe as much pages as you want ( don't get attached to Facebook too much ! )- I don't recommend subscribing to many pages it will be mess
* Add the bot to any channel or group so you can make the channel dedicated to a single page , or some pages related to a category , your personal subscribed list will be same , each channel has its own subscribed list!
* It will check for new posts every hour and send you newer post in order.- can't make it any faster for now as Facebook will block the request ( you are not a robot test and I am  a bot 😔)
* Zero data collected and will never collect data.

  
you can suggest any other features to be added , just DM me

for now the bot is still in alpha and you can face a lot of problems ,  
~~there is no database so every update will clear all your subscribed list~~   
sorry about that but I can't do it right now as I am using a free hosting and need your support donation to upgrade the hosting

\[update 1\]  
\+ Basic Database for hosting your list  
\+Optimized more for channels  
\+ Improved performance and reliability  


\- now update every 8 hours to avoid robot test , Facebook got me

still alpha expect many issues 

&#x200B;

YOUR DONATION IS is needed to make this bot continue this bot works only 18 Hour a day because of the free hosting so I need your help to upgrade hosting plan for now I can't afford it

Jokes aside Telegram has much more features than WhatsApp, it is probably the best one in features over there and integrates with a bunch of stuff, maybe second to Discord.   


Security and Privacy wise Telegram is a little better than WhatsApp. But it is still not there. Being open source helps with auditioning the software, but there are a bunch of keys elements missing about how they keep and share your data. The same way WhatsApp is owned by Facebook I suggest you reading Telegram Wikipedia page to know more about some details that you don't need to be an expert to understand. 

If you are looking for a feature rich chat, I recommend Telegram. 

If you are looking for security and privacy, so that your data is not view and shared there are betters in the market, Like Signal and maybe Session, there are a few more, but I never tested them.

Now, if you really REALLY wants privacy, there are other ways as well. [deleted] can you tell me why? Better than whatsapp. Worse than signal what about privacy? can you tell me why? This is the disappointing part. Messages aren’t default end to end encrypted like signal. You have to “find” the secret chat option. Also group chats are not end to end encrypted where as signal is. 

Many users may have the same issue as you and not have their messages encrypted. In this sense WhatsApp is more secure than telegram. Signal tops both. Signal’s “encryption” is funded by the US government and the app isn’t banned in places where Telegram IS banned because the local governments can’t access messages. Signal is less secure, by far. Where does Signal store messages after they're sent? Research for yourself and stop being so useless >Worse than signal 

Only in terms of privacy. better media quality when sent (no compression). you can secure messages by starting a secret chat, which are not stored in Telegram's servers. Telegram is more secure than whatspp hands down. Might not compete in that area much against Signal, but it could get there. Signal is very good too security-wise, but in functionality Telegram at the moment is better in my opinion.

search it on the internet. whatsapp is not viable anymore. I've been using Telegram heavily the past year, talking out of whatsapp to almost every of my regular contacts of conversation [deleted] THANK YOU! [If privacy is your primary concern, do not use Telegram](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/kuzy5v/im_a_regular_citizen_with_an_opposing_view_in_a/givplom?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), because it's not end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) by default. E2EE means Telegram can't read your data.

Use Signal or any other app that is as or more committed to privacy. Any app that claims to care about privacy needs to be end-to-end encrypted by default. Signal is, and is the most trusted. 

People say they can use secret chats. First off, the vast majority of Telegram users don't use Secret Chats. Furthermore,  I guarantee you that if most of their contacts, required that they only communicate via secret chats, they would be annoyed, and most likely refuse because secrets chats means no cloud backups, you can only use it on one device, and you can't use it on Telegram Desktop.   


Telegram and WA are both terrible at privacy. The only difference is there is far more damning evidence against WA. But there's plenty of evidence against Telegram too, the main one being that they are not end-to-end encrypted by default. So don't use Telegram. Use Signal if you care about privacy.   


If privacy is not a concern to you then by all means... Tor is also still mostly funded by Uncle Sam. That doesn't defeat the fact that it's a decentralized and open source project.

Signal was federated until 2016. What are the banned places in reference? i saw people saying that whatsapp and signal using same encryption (whatsapp since 2016) and it is safer than telegram, because while other apps using same privacy (I dont know technically) for every chat etc but if you want same privacy you have to use a secret chat and id you dont know about this secret chat thing your messages are not safe anymore

sorry for poor grammer, I am not a native speaker [deleted] On your device. I don't have enough knowledge to understand things in this topic Only! okey I will, but I dont have enough knowledge to understand things

I dont understand why people downvoting my comment I just want to learn why do you prefer telegram The cloud chat it’s a feature not a bug. If you come here to nag about e2ee you haven’t understood a thing about how Telegram work and how it can be used. 

Furthermore you seems to mix two différents notions: Privacy and Security.

On the paper Signal seems to be more secure but overall, both services enjoy the same level of privacy. As of today we don’t have any proof that TG has been harvesting private data. 

Last but not least. Signal has an horrendous UX / UI, that’s why the user retention is so low compared to Telegram. TG is just light years ahead. It could have been funded by Uncle Sam, yet the code is open source. Read it yourself. Period Telegram is open source and it has verifiable builds. Also no one ever found a vulnerability in their algorithm then why are they using telegram? [deleted] Any feature that's insecure isn't a feature, it's a Trojan horse. Cloud chat is a security and privacy weakness because it's not E2EE. I use Telegram and understand how it works and is used. I also trust the people in the cryptography and privacy community when they say it's not reliable for privacy.

If you like Telegram that's fine. I got nothing against that. Yes, Telegram has great UI and UX, probably the best.

But when it comes to privacy they suck. Signal & Telegram DO NOT enjoy the same level of privacy for the simple reason that Signal is E2EE by default and doesn't collect any metadata apart from your phone number that you need to sign up.

&#x200B;

>*As of today we don’t have any proof that TG has been harvesting private data*.

How can you say something that is so patently false?

We know for a fact that Telegram collects tons of data from their users. All cloud chats, which is the overwhelming majority of chats, and the default chat mode in Telegram, can be read by Telegram. They have the data in their servers. They have your messages, your contacts, and all the metadata that goes with it. They have that information on their servers and have the power to do whatever they want with it.

That in combination with the fact that Telegram is not E2EE by default means there is a HUGE potential for abuse that is ripe for the taking at any moment in time.

I believe what you actually meant to say is that *there is no evidence that Telegram has ever abused its power*.

What you don't seem to understand, is that even if that were true, it's completely irrelevant. It's irrelevant  because Telegram absolutely can abuse their power precisely because they are not E2EE by default.

Telegram [refuses](https://graph.org/Why-Isnt-Telegram-End-to-End-Encrypted-by-Default-08-14) to reduce the huge risk of abuse of power by making all their chats E2EE by default.

They expect us to trust them on their word alone, instead of their cryptography.

If I have the key to your house and can enter it at any moment, without you ever knowing, it doesn't matter that I promise never to do it. It doesn't matter that I actually keep that promise. All that matters is that I can do it. 

The only way you can be sure that I won't do it, is for me to not have the key to your house. 

Telegram has the key to your house. Therefore [they cannot be trusted](https://graph.org/Why-you-should-stop-reading-Durovs-blog-posts-11-25) with out data. Certainly not on their word alone. They are not worthier or as worthy of our trust than apps that don't have the keys to our data like Signal. What do you mean horrendous UI/UX? Looks clean to me Oh dear. 

Telegram uses its own proprietary encryption protocol, MTProto, to encrypt your messages. This may very well be fine, but since its a closed-source protocol, security researchers can’t verify it. As such, security researchers believe that using an open-source and widely trusted protocol such as the Signal protocol would have been better than using a proprietary closed-source encryption protocol in Telegram.

Please do your research before commenting and misinforming others in future. As i have commented on this exact thing, people don't seem to want to give an actual detailed explanation without Bias.

Signal is by the far the best privacy oriented one, however it lacks in features and groups compared to Telegram, aside from also lacking in people who will adopt it because of said features.

Signal uses End to End Encryption on everything thus why it's more privacy oriented. Telegram uses a custom but as good End to End Encryption in Secret chats, while in normal chats they use said custom encryption only on the Server side.

Telegram is more used because group chats are easier to manage, it has animated stickers, it has bots which you can add to servers or create, and it has an easier time for configuring and customizing Themes, looks and such, as well as still has a lot of privacy settings.

Whatsapp used to be incredibly private, now it's a joke, Telegram is more private than Whatsapp while also being better in lots of ways, but if you are looking for maximum privacy go for Signal, it still has normal stickers, can handle small groups, and still is a good messaging app with a good interface.

What it comes down to entirely is what do you want from the app. I use Signal now a days exclusively for SMS (Since it has that feature) because none of my friends will go into an environment that feels less feature-rich than Whatsapp, thus i use Telegram, which while feature-rich still retains a lot of privacy for the user. Use discord Oh thank you for information, and this detailed comment :) Signal is really the only good option, yes. Unfortunately in my country, South Africa, the people who are trying to now move away from Whatsapp still want some eye candy in terms of animated stickers and seeing last seen and online status.

So they are moving to Telegram ¯\__(ツ)__/¯

Signal is seen as (in their words) ""boring"" and ""bland like SMS"". That's the way the world works now, sensationalist eye candy appeals to the masses. And Telegram has way more of that than Signal, unfortunately.

Riddle me this, in the light of Whatsapp/Facebook's new T&Cs that made headlines, if you could choose between Whatsapp and Telegram, what would you choose? And? They can supposedly read my tomato sauce recipe? Convenience > privacy for the vast majority of users. MTProto is open source (https://core.telegram.org/mtproto). Signal has verifiable builds (it's a genuine question, I don't know)? If not you have to build your own version or trust them. Also there are a lot of open source protocol (see open ssl) with vulnerabilities (aka backdoor) for years, so open is different from safe or trustable (it's better than closed of course). Ask yourself why telegram il blocked in some country but Signal is not. Or why Singapore activists trusted telegram during their protests and no one was arrested using telegram for identification.

Also fyi https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-crypto-keepers-levine Please do a better research for the next time. MTPROTO code is available for researchers to audit and review it. It’s not closed, it’s even open and explained because it’s also exposed via APIs. Problems with researchers were at MTProto v1.0, lot of years ago. It was solved and no more vulnerabilities have been found. [deleted] Maybe *you* should do your research before spreading false information. I won't call Signal more ""privacy-oriented"" than Telegram, I would say ""secure messaging"" oriented or right away ""we do the e2e encryption everywhere"":

1. You can't hide your phone number. 
2. You have to use a phone number to register (bad). 
3. Your messages with someone can be backed up. 
4. You can enable screenshot protection in your phone (and put a passcode to it).
5. You can only delete messages within 3 hours after you sending. 

The Telegram case: 

1. You can hide your phone number. 
1.1. You can enable a feature for people only to find you if they are in YOUR contacts. 
1.2. You can use a username to share. 

2. You have to use a phone number to register (bad). 

3. Your messages with someone are backed up, but you can just wipe them up whenever you want. 
**3.1. Secret chats don't even allow backups (more private).**
**3.2. Secret chats are device-specific, they stay on the phone they were created in. 
3.2.1. You can delete that secret chat remotely (if, for example, you lost your phone or were confiscated) by creating another on a different phone.**

4. You can enable screenshot protection in your phone (and put a passcode to get access to it).
**4.1. Secret chats don't allow screenshots from both sides by default (and even notifies when there was an attempt to).**

So there you go... Telegram has more tools for your privacy and for the peace of mind that you can always do something about your footprint on the internet (*at least on that part*). (comment under u/dzzkovdy's reply) For the record Signal has gifs, emojis, and stickers, all end to end encrypted. All the stickers I personally used on Telegram, I found for Signal with a quick internet search.

To answer your question I don't use WhatsApp. I stopped trusting them when they got bought by FB. I was also already using Telegram long before that happened.

When I started using Telegram neither of them were E2EE. Telegram still isn't. And that's the problem.

You're making it sound like Telegram and WhatsApp are your only choices, when you know very well they are not.

**Asking me which would I choose between Telegram & WhatsApp, is like asking me if I'd rather be the little pig 🐷 who built his house of straw, or the little pig 🐷 who built his house of sticks.**

**When it comes to privacy, they're both terrible choices. The Big Bad Wolf  🐺  can still easily get you.**

I already told you what's wrong with Telegram, they're not E2EE by default.

WhatsApp is E2EE by default but there are 2 loopholes.

&#x200B;

**1. Chat/App Backups are not E2EE**

If you enable chat backups on WhatsApp, which most users do, your messages in the cloud are no longer E2EE and therefore can be read.

And even if you disable chat backups, it's very likely that the people you texts with don't, which means your conversations can still be read. 

&#x200B;

[2. Metadata Matters](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/why-metadata-matters)

Even if WhatsApp made chat backups E2EE, which they don't as I explained above, they still collect a shit ton of metadata.

Metadata is data about your data meaning your contacts, who you text, when you text them, at what time, from which location, how frequently, etc...

[Many studies](https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/1721/snapshot-corporate-profiling) [have shown](https://www.privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/data%20points%20used%20in%20tracking_0.pdf) that with  metadata alone, companies can guess and predict a lot of things about you with an extremely high level of accuracy. Even things you might not even know about yourself.

**Examples:**

*They know you rang a phone sex service at 2:24 am and spoke for 18 minutes. But they don't know what you talked about?*

*They know you called the suicide prevention hotline from the Golden Gate Bridge. But the topic of the call remains a secret?*

*They know you spoke with an HIV testing service, then your doctor, then your health insurance company in the same hour. But they don't know what was discussed?*

*They know you called a gynaecologist, spoke for a half hour, and then called the local Planned Parenthood's number later that day. But nobody knows what you spoke about?*

&#x200B;

Google and Facebook (WhatsApp) are the biggest culprits when it comes to data mining. 

I certainly understand the logic behind feeling safer storing your data with any other company/service that is not them, even if they engage in the same practices. 

But if they are better and more secure options like Signal, I reckon it's worth using it, even if it means a slightly less enjoyable user experience, or having t convert your friends and family. 

**CONCLUSION**

If you like Telegram that's fine. 

The most important thing I want is for you to be well informed about it. I don't want you to think your privacy is protected on Telegram when  it's not. That's my issue. All the people spreading misinformation believing Telegram protects their privacy when it effectively doesn't. 

&#x200B;

As long as you are well informed I'm good. Are you suggesting that the information you share on WA & Telegram is mundane and has no use to interested parties?   


You're probably right that most user prefer convenience over privacy. My problem is that people think they have privacy with Telegram. As long as they know they don't, as long as they are informed users, then I guess that's better that being misinformed.   


What is Signal missing that you Telegram & WhatsApp have for you? Clearly not open source. You’ve provided a link to an FAQ 👏🏼

https://github.com/signalapp

Ask yourself why you are unable to provider server side open source code 

If you wish to use telegram that’s your prerogative however falsifying claims telegrams is something it’s not doesn’t help people make an informed decision. Please provide the link for this server side open source you claim exists. 

In the meantime here’s signals - https://github.com/signalapp

😉 Clearly not open source. You’ve provided a link to an FAQ 👏🏼

Signals - https://github.com/signalapp

Ask yourself why you are unable to provider server side open source code 

If you wish to use telegram that’s your prerogative however falsifying claims telegrams is something it’s not doesn’t help people make an informed decision. And here is the cherry on the top of the cake: [Signal uses Google services](https://np.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/3srhxh/signal_on_android_google_play_services/), so it is useless. You may as well use a frontend fork like Molly-FOSS or LibreSignal, but that does not make Moxie any more trustworthy.

Also, [it is unstable](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10693).

Also, [Signal groups are beginning to use Google servers](https://np.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/l05f0m/new_signal_groups_use_google_servers/).

Finally, [this stupid thing](https://decrypt.co/55422/signal-is-experimenting-with-stellar-based-cryptocurrency-report). I use Telegram more, because it simply is more usable than Signal, Signal has its fair share of usability issues. Depending on the view of everything and what you consider privacy it fulfills that need. And yes, you're completely right, it's more secure messaging oriented. 

I feel simply that Signal is much like deciding to go back to MSN and such, it has a secure e2ee which makes it very nice for sharing messages privately with others and such, but it's (imo) useless in the feature department, as the very first thing it likes to do is try to become your SMS handler with the phone app. And then it lacks many of the wonderful groups Telegram has, and lack of bots, and such.

Telegram has a mindset i find optimal for the majority of people: Security of encryption (So information can't get robbed) while also not forcing privacy down your throat (Or better saying, the idea of privacy). It has so many good features that respect your privacy and security, and they aren't hard to find. Reseeing this comment again kinda reminds me of why i stayed with Telegram over Signal in the end, and why the original mentality of ""Just because it has e2ee it's save"" is little more than propaganda at this point. Commented Thank you for the informative reply. Is there any known privacy breach in Telegram? I mean, it's not that we have to wait for one to prove a point, but there has been none since 7 years.  
  
Here are some of the features:  
  
• Editing messages  
• Sending documents and videos up to 2GB  
• Deleting messages without a trace  
• Native desktop and tablet apps  
• Multiple accounts and Chat folders  
• Usernames instead of phone numbers  
• Granular privacy settings  
• Group chats of up to 200,000 members  
• Admin tools and stats for group owners  
• Voice Chats for up to 5,000 participants  
• 20,000+ high-quality Animated stickers  
• Custom Color Themes like Retro  
• Video messages   
• One-to-many channels  
• Video editing tools  
• API and Bot platform for developers  
• Programmed emoji   
• Disappearing photos or videos  
• Self-Destructing end-to-end encrypted Chats  
• Partial selection for messages  
• Scheduled and silent messages  
• Pinned messages and polls  
• Persistent chat history  
• Saved Messages and Drafts   
• Encrypted Voice and Video Calls Server aren't verifiable, so open or closed doesn't matters much. Anyway, I live in a free country (not America) and I value more the cloud chat over secrecy over NSA / CIA. But I wonder why user that risk their life (like gay in Iran) prefers telegram over signal. And I suspect Signal encription has vulnerabilities, while telegram's one still intact. Anyway, I will never trust whatsapp and Facebook You're welcome! :D I see. So just to be clear, you'd rather compromise your privacy for the sake of these features? Compared to an almost barebone app? Totally. Telegram has a clean record so far and I don't see things changing anytime soon. At least you can admit that. 

Two more questions. 

1. What do you mean by Telegram has a clean record? 

2. If most of your Telegram contacts preferred to talk in secret chats only, would you accept?"
Welcome friends!;824;kv02iu;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/8rff0shijoa61.jpg;38;;2021-01-11 13:24:23;"""I was using it before it was cool"" I'm using it since 2014, but I appreciate if more people use it. Thats me.. been using it since 2013. Been tell everyone who would listen to join telegram ever since. That's my reaction when I see ""X joined telegram"" Yep, down since day 1. 2017 user 🙋🏻‍♂️ First time using it since 2018 'coz me and my classmates wanted to play werewolf together, it was so much fun while it lasted. Been using it ever since as a journal and sending of resources for my studies. Our friend group has been on since 2013. Its become a requirement if you're playing in any of our fantasy leagues. I've known about and have wanted to use it since 2016. As soon as they made their mobile apps accessible with screen readers on Android and iOS I jumped aboard. Now I just wish more of the people I talk to would use it... I tried it first in 2017, only because my ex had an iPhone 4, and whatsapp didn't support that device. It wws pretty basic, nothing new. Butbwhen in 2019x the features started to nose in. Mmmmmmm my man, super cool. Haha, I can relate to that I only started using it when I got a NAS (so that I can have bots notify me of stuff happening on the NAS).

As for normal communication, maybe 99% of the people I contact regularly are on Facebook, but hardly anyone is on Telegram. 2016 :) Been using telegram since 2015. Such a good app! Never used WhatsApp but I don't think I am missing out by not using something that is owned by facebook. I started using signal to try it out about six months ago and while I do like that it has full encryption the features are a bit lacking in comparison to telegram. יאָפּ Yup. Since 2009 I hope more people get to use it. Whatsapp and anything related to Mark Zuckerberg has to die. I always knew it was superior. It's greatest flaw was it's unpopularity among my friends, making the app kinda useless haha Not super excited about Telegram becoming the platform for chuds once they get deplatformed everywhere else, but as long as it stays up and I don't have to see it... The subtle line between hipster and scenester is ~ 5 years. Same! Basically since Facebook purchased WhatsApp, started moving over to Telegram! Me too. I even had Telegram before WhatsApp. And some friends used Threema and Skype, too. It was not so monopolistic back then and I refused anything Google and Facebook from the beginning.
Later, obviously I was forced to try WhatsApp. I was a kid in 2014 when I called my cousin ""dumb"" for using something no one would. That WhatsApp was way better. 

*Oh, boy, look at who was the dumb one.* Huh, legend! 🎖️ Best way is switching your contacts and making them switch their contacts to Telegram Telegram came out in 2013 To be fair, Telegram is not that better, it has a huge problem with data privacy.

The vast majority of chats are not e2e encrypted and that's a huge issue. God i hope fb doesn't purchase tele....ill have to stop using it then just like I did with all the other apps fb ate Well it might be clumsy to use a communication app that nobody of your friends uses, but not dumb. Also they won't confess they were the dumb ones since over time telegram  is earning more users. You’re right. I’m thinking GroupME which inevitably lead me to Telegram. I was using Windows Phone 7 at the time and remember trying to find alternatives to GroupME. Which also was in 2009. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. e2e isn’t the only way to make secure conversations Nah I really doubt Durov will sell to FB or anything related to them. Too many principles he disagrees with Secure maybe not, private yes Heck he switched gify with tenor when fb brought the former. Data was never leaked from Telegram, so I don’t see any issues with it’s security The problem is that you can't prove it that it was never leaked. And it might be leaked in the future. With e2e you could be ignoring this risk, which is more likely than not."

I'm seriously considering to completely delete my whatsapp account, given the FB ultimatum due on Feb 8th.

There it should give you the option to just ""share"" or export the chat text, or also include any media (pics, audio and such). I'd do both. (Note that the ""include media"" can generate quite a big zip file).

The exported chat text file has the following format for each message:

    M/D/YY, hh:mm AM - <userNameOrPhone>: <msgtext> They're encrypted. I can see the folder /WhatsApp/Databases hast a bunch of files     msgstore-YYYY-MM-DD.XX-XX.db.crypt12.     
    
I don't think I can open these easily. Yeah thanks...but I'd need to do that for the conversations of 5+ years. I'd like to know if there's a batch way of getting them all in one shot. Not going over hundreds of conversations, one by one. Most you can do it manually select what messages to keep and send them over, unfortunately Of you find a way to do it with media included...

I used to get one or two a year.  It's been a dozen in the last four days.   
 And they are not in any of my contact lists (personal or work).    


Would love to know how this is happening. Presumably that means that if they don't have my number saved in their contacts, they don't see any kind of notification, correct? Same problem here..any solutions? settings > notifications and sounds > events. uncheck the ""contact joined Telegram"" I have noticed this as well They won't get a ""Person joined"" notification no. 

If you message them following a ""Person joined"" notification they may, or may not get a notification depending on the privacy settings they have defined for their account. That doesn't solve  my feed getting filled with ""xxxx has joined telegram!"", so fucking annoying,"

You phone contacts should not sync with the servers and any contacts that have been synced will be deleted."

Telegram said there will only be ads in places like group channels, so I made a concept of what a GOOD advertisement would look like - a clean look and a non-intrusive layout;45;kus1ts;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/rdyfvs8evla61.png;47;;2021-01-11 04:25:39;"lol imagine Durov put an iphone ad in his channel 😆 would be better at the top, underneath the chat name imo. putting it at the bottom encourages accidental taps. the ad should be implemented as a channel message just as other app ad form nowadays. It will be less annoying if it's not going to always occupy a space on your screen You made a concept, showed us the post, but never read it. :/

>we will never force you to view 30-second ads on Telegram. If we ever introduce ads, the ads will be shown only in large one-to-many channels which are expensive to run due to server and traffic costs (like my channel u/durov) and not targeted based on any private data (unlike Facebook). So, no collecting private data, no user profiling etc. And if you don't use our one-to-many channels (which are non-existent in all other messaging apps), you won't see a single ad. IMO ads at the bottom of the device is annoying. Everybody get shocked at the ads news, even if will be only shown in large channels and are privacy friendly. To be honest there are already ton of ads on telegram in these large channels.. All those messages of sponsorship between channels are ads.

Said this, I'd prefer ads to keep the format of normal messages like now, with a small grayed ""sponsored"" written in it Whoa whoa whoa, there are ads now?
Or there will be? If ads really show up on Telegram I might stop using it.

Ads will encourage data mining and less privacy. Cool concept I expect it will be a message format like here on Reddit. Folks here is the question you need to ask yourself about every online service you use: who pays for this? The more data going to and from a server the more expensive it becomes.

If you can't identify the product being sold, then you might be the product.

Telegram doesn't currently have an income stream so it is going to go away when Durov runs out of money or interest. If you want to continue using Telegram you need it to have an income stream that makes sense. Durov's proposal is very modest and makes sense. Perhaps he will also do a ""premium"" version where you can pay to skip ads, but I am not sure it will get enough takers to be worth the money. If I see ads I uninstall Put ad on the top, that would be better [He uses Mac though.](https://www.bestgamesworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pavel-durov-commented-on-the-unlock-telegram-in-russia-696x395.jpg) agreed, would be much harder to accident tap if placed on top [deleted] maybe that's what they want. CPC generates more than CPV This is the right answer, way better to have an ad somewhere in the feed rather than a banner just hanging around on the UI Yes, will be on channels. Nope, that message where duroc announced ads he also stated multiple times, that the ads are coming from their servers and that they are focusing on making the ads secure for privacy.

Also that the ads won't look like this picture above, but more like messages inside a chat. Use Signal. same. Then you're a bit dumb, maybe try to read on the official updates from Durov to know what is the change about and you may learn it might not even impact you.... If you don't already see ads on your Telegram chats/groups/channels I'd imagine nothing will change for you once Telegram introduces their own ad platform. That's a very old photo, he also used an iPhone then i was thinking more akin to a pinned message or a proxy sponsor i imagine there will be a lot of new users of shady third party clients if a similar design was chosen Misinformation. ""we will never force you to view 30-second ads on Telegram. If we ever introduce ads, the ads will be shown only in large one-to-many channels which are expensive to run due to server and traffic costs (like my channel u/durov) and not targeted based on any private data (unlike Facebook). So, no collecting private data, no user profiling etc. And if you don't use our one-to-many channels (which are non-existent in all other messaging apps), you won't see a single ad."" I don't really believe that... How do you suppose they will continue to make revenue if they can't guarantee more solid clicks? I do use signal Will repeat once again. If I see ads I will uninstall.  You're silly I expect to see double the ads one of his former employees said he would use an iphone as his primary device They actually want to start making revenue. Durov paid for the most time all of telegrams servers and development costs.

With this step (because of a new flood of users) telegram tries to maintain privacy and start making money.

So I'll trust it.
You can go into his channel if you want and see for yourself :) what's coming is not that harsh as it sounds. Why don't you read Durov's answers?

""we will never force you to view 30-second ads on Telegram.

Close minded He has winced urged people to move to Android due to Apple being very closed and less consumer minded in its ecosystem. I will give him the benefit of the doubt that his intentions are in the right place but its going to be tough not to go down that road. Businesses and marketing firms are going to need to see something else other than the number of users that may see the ad... At some point businesses looking to advertise are going to ask for something that they can justify their advertisement for. That will be the real test that Telegram will have to endure when they decide if they are going to continue to fight the good fight and advocate for privacy or will they end up like most other companies and succumb to what their paying clients want. Imagine telling me what choices I should make. A bunch of fanboys or Russian bots lol. I'm switching to signal for privacy no, this was after that post.  it was said he tried to move to android multiple times and just kept going back. He lost VK due to him refusing to break his integrity instead of keeping to rake in money from that cash cow. I understand and see the problem, but my guess is:
Of you are in a telegram channel that is focused on pets I'd guess that you get only pet ads in this channel.

This is basically personalized ads but without giving the information about the users specifically. Okay cya Huh, interesting. It's hard when habits form. :p A couple of days ago somebody asked him what device he is using right now. He replied ""Samsung S20"". So he's on Android right now. I think that can give us all hope that Telegram may do the right thing on how to handle ads but that was a different situation. He viewed that as being unlawful, he might not view it the same way when it comes to monetizing. That is actually a very solid alternative to selling advertising and I hope they do something like that. that’s when dual carry comes in :P I'm sure they will.

They won't risk their status as a privacy related messenger. Especially after all that what they achieved."

Private groups. Easy to forward messages around. The beauty of it is that you really only see content you seek out. Amazon shut their parler servers I think. And their app was removed from both app stores. As a longtime Telegram user, I’ve noticed that some relatives of the Parler set are starting to show up on the platform. The amount of “X joined Telegram” notifications has had a sharp uptick in the last few days, and it’s almost always “those people”.

I think there’s been a push as of late to migrate over to Telegram in US far-right circles, as it’s both just obscure enough over here to not be instantly recognizable and take action against these idiots, and big enough to have a decent support network and extant user base. Would telling them it's (primarily) funded by a private Russian billionaire put them off? God, I fucking hope not. Is parler a group/one to one chat thing or more like a forum? It might be hard to have large groups and such on telegram. Parlor users can fuck off to somewhere else Please, no. Let those QAnon types go somewhere else. Oh please no [deleted] This is a really unfortunate coincidence, now that a lot of people are approaching Telegram I can't wait for the media to milk on it saying that ""Telegram is the new Parler"" making it look like some kind of parler/gab/voat of 2021 parler is just like twitter really.

What it will do is notify any user that already has your phone number in their synced contacts that you joined. 

You can go into your privacy settings and set your phone number to show to Nobody. Then you can set a username that people can find you by. Your phone number will be visible to anyone that already has it in their contacts, but to everyone else, they'll just see your username. 

In the same place as mentioned above, you can also set it to only allow your contacts to find you by your phone number. This way, if you synced your phone contacts to Telegram, only those people can find you with your phone number. Anyone else that tries entering your phone number will be told that it doesn't look like you use Telegram. In privacy settings you can choose who can see your phone number That’s awesome. Thanks for your reply mate. Cheers! This is helpful. Was just thinking about how other people see my name displayed.

So basically phone contacts see me as my phone number, non phone contacts / people in groups/whatever else see me by a username if I set one? What if I don't set one?

Right now I have it set as ""phone number"" nobody and who can find me by number as my contacts. So who sees what?

I haven't used anything at all just yet. Just feeling out the app and reading about things. Thanks mate. 👍"

I can deal with it but I know alot of families that use WhatsApp with their younger children and with the large migration users are doing from whatsapp to telegram I wonder if people are aware of the downsides to such switch I cant find the disable option. Where it is located ? I really hope parents are doing their due diligence when it comes to educating their children about online privacy and the dangers that exist, especially if they're letting them use internet messengers. I bet that 'people nearby' button would look enticing to any kid. Otherwise, you might want to direct those families towards Signal instead if they're using it for family chat.

In the past I've used sticker.ly to create and send to WhatsApp.  There is a function in sticker.ly to create a link and share with Telegram but telegram always seems to error out when trying to import that link. You unfortunately can't do it easily, the only way is to download the webp images from whatsapp web on pc, and then re create the sticker on telegram using the stickers bot Try ""Sticker Maker for Telegram"" on Android Try to find them by names using search engine. I'm pretty sure they're available. Won’t be long before popular wa sticker apps integrate an add to Telegram feature [removed] On Android, using a file manager go to Whatsapp/media/Whatsapp Stickers, you'll find all your stickers there (as well as stickers recently sent by your friends, even if you didn't add those stickers to your favorites) and a file named .nomedia, this file tells your Gallery app to ignore this directory so deleting it will make all your stickers show up on your Gallery under the album Whatsapp Stickers (sometimes you need to reboot your device so the gallery app detects it), since today the @stickers bot supports .webp files wich is the same extension as Whatsapp stickers, so just go chat with the bot to create sticker packs with those whatsapp stickers. You need to talk to the sticker bot @Stickers (use the search engine to find it) and it will guide you through the process. But there's no easy way to create one through apps like stickerly or to migrate from whatapp

Edit. You can also talk to @StickersConverterBot and it will convert your image to png and resize it for the @Stickers bot That's horrible. 

Know of any sticker apps that work with Telegram?  So for everyone I find does not work.

Update
This chat app has to be the worst interface I've come across. Adding something as simple as a sticker is ridiculous. Currently using iOS I can't seem to send the sticker to telegram a/ this app Also if your sticker is popular, there's big chance that it's already being exported to telegram. you can send me their names I have resources that can look it up for ya You think like that because you probably don’t understand how stickers work on Telegram (getting sticker predictions when you type an emoji, how do you think that works then?) > This chat app has to be the worst interface I've come across. Adding something as simple as a sticker is ridiculous.

What!
On Telegram you don't need 3rd party apps to add stickers, just use [Stickers bot](https://telegram.me/Stickers), create a new pack, add a name and send your stickers, **them you can share it with anyone**   
Just that simple, no bloatware needed Unfortunately yes, stickers are very hard to add I used to use ""Stickery"" for iOS but I don't know if it's still working I try and it works. Look if you started the bot, the app explain how Stickerbot is not very user friendly at all. First it seems to require me to use the desktop app. As when using the mobile app everything I upload it tells me “Please attach the image as a file (uncompressed), not as a photo”

Then when you select it as “file” it has to only be a PNG type. 

I don’t know of any apps that greats the file as PNG. So short of converting EVERY sticker to PNG then going through the upload again, there’s no easy or quick way about it. 

If I wanted just random everyday stickers it’s no problem. But like most we have 100s of custom made stickers. And create more all the time. 

So yes this interface for stickers is about the worst there is. At this point I’d rather let FB insert the 5g microchip in me verses using this sticker function. Tried that. When it tries to export to Telegram it errors out and the error message is in Spanish."

That'd be more useful than memeing on WhatsApp, I don't keep track of all the stuff Telegram has and it'd be a pain to explain it to all of my friends that made the switch with this news.

^[(Github)](https://github.com/username) ^| ^[(What's new)](https://github.com/username) I believe Signal requires both parties to have each other's phone number.  Where Telegram you can share your username instead without giving out your phone number.  You do need to adjust your privacy and security settings to never share your phone number.  

If both parties have each others phone number than use Signal. But Secret Chats and Audio Calls through Telegram is, my understanding E2E Encrypted. 

Telegram is a great app for public broadcast channels. Although groups looks like it has a limit of 200,000. Rekt. 

Side note. Telegram should implant end to end encryption on all conversations. Right now it’s bottom of the pack👀 Much more better is Threema, a Swiss app based on security and strong encryption. Offers at least the functions as Telegram does on secured bunkerized servers... You can’t have cloud chats with e2e. That’s why cloud chats and secret chats are separate"

- explain how telegram's cache management is a godsend: setting it to delete media older than 3 days / a week / a month and literally never worry about filling up space on the phone while having EVERYTHING backed up seamlessly

- the ability to edit typos is also pretty neat, forget about *corrections

These are my top reasons why telegram is awesome, there are of course many more worth praising Funny enough, how people, even very rational, do not care about their privacy and at the same time failed to answer my question “Would you hand over an open box of postcards for your friends with very private notes and personal photos to barely trusted person who comes by your house, telling you he/she is skilled and experienced, in order to deliver them or store over a night at unknown location?” lmao exactly, some people are just too lazy to bother switching, even if it’s for their own good. Meh privacy. Telegram is just so much better in terms of functionality... Already existing options here will be in some time copied to The Green App, but why using a bad clone when you can have an original? Most people don't, which doesn't cease to surprise me whenever I think about it. But, since privacy isn't up their alley, talk to them about convenience instead. Editing/deleting messages, changing the app's look easily, storing files - you know, the stuff WhatsApp lacks. You are coming at this from a wrong angle. Don't throw Telegram down their throats, that should be end step when you present alternatives.

Privacy policy is abstract term even for tech (IT) savvy people, let alone regular people.

So, you need to explain in layman's terms what that means and how that applies to them.

And no, this is not a fast and easy process.

I'm still thinking how to tackle this (family, friends, partner, clients).


I did something similar in 2013 with Viber. It was (still is) prevalent app in my country but I boycotted it. Everyone always gave me a weird eye. But now with WhatsApp, it's much harder as its ubiquitous, and I'm planning of emigrating, so I'll need to stay in some contact with dear people. I say dont force them. Let them come automatically. I also tried to convince people even before this new privacy saga unfolded in the past one week. They didnt listen. But now slowly one after another is joining Telegram and signal. I deleted my WhatsApp account and now they only have literally just these two options.it will take time  but it will happen. Be patient. Explain them the cloud storage feature. You never have to back your chats up, you never have to worry about switching phones. Switching android <-> iPhone is a million times easier than with whatsapp, you can sign in from your private phone, business phone, pc, works pc and all are cloud synced and work without issues. This is something I can never live without anymore tbh, having chats cloud synced, not worrying about lost chats when you lose your phone, is just great Then tell them about the other features of telegram. At the some point I told my family / friends:

I’m deleting WhatsApp in 1h, the only way to contact me from now on will be either Signal or Telegram.

After a few days of no reply on WhatsApp, pretty much everybody in my circle had install one (most of the time both) service. I’ve managed a few of them by showing Telegram storage options. But I can say for sure that it will not happen overnight or never. Hey mum, let me tell you about Telegram cache management. Looks like I have to accept the wicked terms of WhatsApp or die alone. ""part of this will just be never using WhatsApp again. You eventually need to set an example. I agree it's way harder than it should"

"Telegram's ""Export Chat"" feature's limitations";3;ku26gf;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ku26gf/telegrams_export_chat_features_limitations/;2;"Hello Telegram users,

We all know the recent developments about WhatsApp and I am one of the people who made the switch. First impressions? Amazing. Desktop app works incredibly smooth and fast. Little detail settings are phenomenal and overall, very good app. But there is one thing that is bothering me. I am a person with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder). 

I extremely value about the storage of my messages. I accumulated about a million messages on WhatsApp and there is no easy way to get them out of there (no need to discuss about this). If I am going to switch, I want an app which will help me when I want to export my messages, such as Telegram. I know that there is a export function on Telegram's desktop app and I have some questions about it. 

1. What it's limitations? Can I export, for example, 100 private conversations and 50 groups with a total of 1 million messages? 
2. If there is a limit for how many massages you can export at a given time, what is that limit?
3. Is there a way to automate this backup process, specifically exporting them as HTML, so that it happens, for example, every week?

Thank you for your answers!";2021-01-10 02:31:06;"1. there are no limitations. The export tool will export everything. Anyway, you can't export only _some_ chats. It's either every chat, or a single one
2. if there's a limit, it's unknown. Messages are exported sequentially and the export process will go on as long as there's stuff to export. So it won't block you beforehand saying ""too many messages to export"" even when there's millions of messages to export. Mind that exporting a lot of chats might take a while
3. there is no way to automate or schedule an export using Telegram Desktop Thank you for your response sir! Appreciated."

All my homies hate Facebook. Which one is better?

Edit: i appreciate all the replies, i already had pulse because my family is on it but I downloaded telegram to try it out, seems legit, only draw back unless I'm missing something is i can only text people who also have telegram? I wanted to ditch pulse because the chat back ups are a bit of a headache and i really don't need that much security, that being said I can text anyone in my phone book even if they don't use pulse which is a win for me. I'm actually really delighted to see the mass exodus from Whatsapp to Telegram or Signal. I have had it with Whatsapp/Facebook/Instagram. Will  be deleting everything real soon. Not sure which is better to use between Telegram or Signal though. Anyone interested to share the pro's  and cons? Asked the same questions to Signal users on reddit btw. Also, is there a  way to NOT have my phone number connected to  my account? So people who have my phone number can't message me or even see that I have an account what  so ever until I personally accept to add them or give the green light? I hate it when Signal can’t identify a Screenshot 📸 Signal gets funding from USA, so it is not a fair comparison. Telegram is totally free, Signal not.

https://www.vocativ.com/news/307106/whatsapp-encryption/index.html I installed signal.. got no one on my contacts using it.

Looks clean though. xmpp prevail me who has two oculus headsets being forced to Hell yissss! Agreed and Agreed again How did you migrate all your family and friends to either of these two? Meanwhile all my friends and contacts are on whatsapp Is there really more privacy than Facebook? Bruh
I'm forced to use WA because of my classmates and friends. Such a lamers Still that Telegram server apps are not open source. Boomers love it. I’m trying my best to got used to signal . Threema 4 the win! I am either app users but I still use WhatsApp. No WhatsApp no food. FACEBOOK..destroying services since 2004. Seriously they just destroyed Whatsapp and Instagram, both were good products until a few years ago. ... and Twitter. Signal is arguably more secure and private, but Telegram (while keeping it privacy-friendly) has much more functionalities It just depends on what you need.

**Telegram benefits:** more features and customization (sending files up to 2GB, great desktop app, etc.) More info: [https://telegram.org/](https://telegram.org/)

**Signal benefits:** more privacy and security (end-to-end-encryption by default, endorsed by Snowden, etc.) More info: [https://signal.org/](https://signal.org/)

Both have their advantages and there's no drawback in using both. And having a fallback contact is always a good idea. I'll use both of them. :) You can have anonymity and privacy in TG, but only privacy in Signal. And the real world threat model in my country (Belarus) is such that you can't have real privacy without anonymity, because without anonymity privacy can't survive through the full control over mobile carriers, mobile phone seizing by ""police"", interrogations and tortures. you are on telegram subreddit ;) Telegram From a reply I sent to another user here

>Also, is there a way to NOT have my phone number connected to my account? 

Telegram allows usernames. Probably best to use a temporary phone number or online alternative just for registration and set a custom username after that. Signal doesn't have the username function yet but I believe its implementation is in progress. You should check their sites for more info (linked above). Telegram is going to start selling ads. I heard the ads will be in the channels and not chats. No proofs for Signal being not free. that's the issue. Many people don't even know about the service A true based hero. how many eyes do you have? Tell them about all great Telegram features (you can find more info about them in official Telegram Tips channel) Definitely. You can take a look at the FAQs on Telegrams (and Signals) website. Tell them to switch to Telegram You can’t check if they use the same source code they published online on their servers Better get used to Telegram Threema feels very chunky for me somehow. It’s not as smooth and fast as signal and Telegram is a lightning compared to signal. After recent censorship events and other negative experiences I am seriously considering to end my twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp accounts. I never used Facebook although I still see they keep my personal information without my consent - or I am failing to delete everything from there. Anyway, question is: is vpn, TOR, DDGo, protonmail, telegram, the way to go?
More specifically, is telegram the best replacement for WhatsApp and what would be good alternatives to Instagram and twitter? and Google. this

When it's sensitive, I use Signal. Daily chit-chat, I use Telegram But doesn't support reactions. I love telegram, but when compairing signal and telegram, it is misleading to say more privacy, cause telegram basically has none. Usernames are a very underrated telegram feature (or you can avoid using them altogether when part of a group and have confidence nobody who doesn’t already have your phone number in their contacts will know it from being a part of a group.) Ok, so tell me why telegram is better lol I heard Signal is going to start using user names soon this year. again: Signal gets funding from USA. Not anymore :) well I got the quest 1 last year and upgraded to the quest 2 this year They're too stupid for that Yeah but it provides better security than both of then - not only because it's hosted in Switzerland... Censorship events? The real anonymous product on this list is Tor. I'm not sure if Telegram is that anonymous because it requires a phone number to register. Why don't you just use Telegram with secret chats? If you use Telegram with secure chat you have privacy (E2E) in that the content of your chat is private. And that's what most people care about in regular day to day usage.
Telegram identifies you more and asks for some more permissions than Signal, but I don't see how that matters for a regular user who just wants to score some weed or simply feel its a political statement to stay private.

Over and over I see people trashing Telegram over Signal, but its a way too black and white representation imo.
Also, Telegram is lightyears ahead of Signal if we talk about features outside of E2E chats. Imo Telegram is better because it has more features. 2gb file share is what keeps me coming back and I just really like the UI and how everything works. However if security was a major concern for you then on telegram only secret chats are e2e encrypted whereas signal all chats are by default. Telegram has users. Signal has no webapp :( It's hard to say what's better. There is still no absolute winner between T & S.

S has less features, T's homebrew encryption is questionable.

But.

Telegram has long and successful history of oppressive regimes' censorship evasion. Russia, Iran, HK. It has VERY elaborate network of proxies and its own worldwide–distributed server infrastructure, so Amazon can't deplatform it.

Nowadays all governments are more or less oppressive. And the most oppressive shit is not govt, but fucking Big Tech monopolies.

At the same time, Signal's original mission was privacy and encryption, not resistance, resilience and ban evasion. I've heard not-so-good things about Signal when it comes to support for non-mainstream operating systems. Telegram is more open for that as in you can write your own client - they even provide a library for it (tdlib) But for now in a signal group, you can see everyone’s phone number and everyone can see yours.  This is a big breach of privacy (forcing you to share your phone) and could lead to more spam calls and texts or at worst a government tracking your speech https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ktyqqo/comment/gir0pyb But for now in a signal group, you can see everyone’s phone number and everyone can see yours.  This is a big breach of privacy (forcing you to share your phone) and could lead to more spam calls and texts or at worst a government tracking your speech https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ktyqqo/comment/gir0pyb So does Tor, that does not mean it is not secure. they're now so popular Then try making your self contactable via Telegram only for a week or so I’m not exactly sure if the security is better or worse than Signal’s (definitely better than Telegram’s - at least as long as you don’t use secret chats on Telegram), but of course Threema is also very safe and has good privacy policies. Because I don't like to write the same message to multiple people. Aka secret chats do not support group chats.

Therefore you have no other choice as to use another messenger for a group e2ee conversation. Oof. HK = Hongkong? What things? Links? Doesn’t mean it isn’t, but the chances of it having a back door goes way up Yea they went from 10m to 50m users in like 2 days it's crazy I would say it probably same as signal but you don't need to connect your email or phone nr.

Link previews?;1;ktvblk;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ktvblk/link_previews/;6;So I finally got my friends to migrate over from Whatsapp, but a thing thats annoying is that we have a tiktok group but none of the tiktoks get link previews generated..while whatsapp had these previews. Anybody know anything about this?;2021-01-09 20:36:53;"I tried Tiktok links in Telegram and Whatsapp, they didn't show preview, I think it's problem of Tiktok landing itself Probably TikTok is blocking previews.

Let's say the tiktok link is somehting like: [https://vm.tiktok.com/123123/](https://vm.tiktok.com/123123/)

Pasting this won't show a link, but removing even jus tthe last slash and the '3' generates a preview (I assume like a 404 or something like that) but as soon as the whole link is entered the preview disappears. Quite odd. Checked it, maybe the reason is because link previews generated on Telegram servers for more anonymity, and Tiktok can't work with this, which is weird, since all links should work perfectly, maybe Tiktok has some system to send away bots.

Durov's reasoning on not open sourcing the server code, everyone;91;ktthig;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ktthig/durovs_reasoning_on_not_open_sourcing_the_server/;25;"> Exactly, I’m also puzzled by folks who even mention server-side code in this context. Publishing the server code doesn’t improve security, because - unlike with the client-side code - there’s no way to verify that the same code is run on the servers.

> And you don’t even need the server-side code to check the integrity of Secret Chats - they are solid regardless of what’s going on on the servers (that’s the whole point). In other words, publishing server-side code won’t help verify neither Secret, nor Cloud Chats, and would constitute a marketing gimmick that has nothing to do with security.

> Me: The code of Telegram apps is open. It is verifiable. No other app has verifiable builds. WhatsApp’s code is hidden and intentionally obfuscated.
Confused user: You are lying, your server code is not open! 🤬
Me: 🤯

> So why not publish the server code anyway, even if it adds zero to security? 3 years ago I learnt that an authoritarian regime (you may guess which) was looking for a way to obtain Telegram’s server code. Their plan was to launch their own equally convenient local app and then to shut down all other social media in the country.

> After having heard that I put our plans to publish the server code on hold. I didn’t want to provide dictators with tools to enslave their population - that shouldn’t be the legacy of Telegram. We are not ready to betray our values because a few confused users seem to think publishing server-side code will somehow improve verifiability.";2021-01-09 19:05:22;"In some aspects he is right, Signal's server source code is open, did it change something? We still don't know if they're hosting the same software or edited one. I am using Telegram and yet, I think this post is a lot of cope. 

It would be good to see fully open code to answer the question whether they have any loopholes missed. This would not answer the question of the code running of the servers, but it would already increase the level of security and the level of trust. I don't know, if a government wanted to establish a social media to control their population they can just do it, they don't need Telegram server code. [removed] he means Iran. There was a lot of telegram knockoff and still some. While I think Durov has other reasons as well, I think some of you are underestimating the effectiveness of a local app. 

A government could simply decree that all official communication related to govt work should be handled on their local app. They can offer rewards of some kind to pull people in.  As people slowly start adapting to the new tech, They can then throttle all other apps to give monopoly of the userbase to their local app, and boom the exact nightmare scenario that he warns will occur. They really should audit the servers like Signal did. Trust should be minimized. To contribute to the discussion with first hand experience, I must say that the most important reason local messaging apps and telegram knockoffs failed in Iran was because of awful server code.

They've so far failed to make a reliable client, let alone establish a server network powerful enough to compete with telegram passing through VPN and several proxies; the latency is still much better than any app despite being severely blocked. Haven't they already blocked Telegram in Iran? If so, what would change by opening the source code? Well, other than users trusting the app some more. Signal uses SGX enclaves which give clients the ability to verify that correct/untampered code is running within those enclaves. So yes, in fact there are ways to confirm the server is running what you expect it to be running. It's still better if the code was open source, just so other people can make their own servers. It's never good to *only* rely on a centralized architecture So, it's not a problem to publish it then?

So why is he making it a problem? His reasoning is stupid. The infamous dictatorship he's referring to can use Signal's source code that is published. What, does he think his server source code is so much superior that an entire state couldn't have something better or just reuse Signal's? Who do you think will be first to find a loophole, you or Iran? Well taking the sourcecode of an app which success is already proven and well established would make things waaay easier instead of trying to build everything from the ground-up. Also considering the country he's talking about is most likely Iran, where 80% of the population uses Telegram, which almost replaced the entire internet there (the irianian government filters _a lot_ of content that people are accessing through Telegram instead, thanks to public channels/bots and the high files size limit). If they want to move the population from Telegram to their own messenger, they would have to offer a service that is as scalable and flexible as telegram's. Which is not something trivial to do, even for a government

That being said, I too find Durov's reasons not enough credible to justify the choice Iran is a state that hacks Israel and the US on a regular basis. They don't particularly need or would struggle to get their hands on his precious code.

The only reason why he winks-winks about Iran is because of his overinflated ego and he genuinely thinks he's some kind of real life freedom fighting James Bond. I don't think that's what Durov is referring to... he means a government knock-off Exactly and even though it might profit the rest of the world, or some couldn't say 'but the server code is not open' anymore, this might put a lot of people in great risk. Imagining his position, i think it's a good choice. I would have done the same, because otherwise I'd have to feel like there's 'blood on my hands' They can simply run another service which makes a copy of dtabases, run some data mining on chats and sell the results to thirdparties. This is no amount of openness that can prove Telegram isn't doing this. That doesn't make it more secure though, that just makes it completely forkable.

Edit: The one thing you could gain is the potential for a community member to spot a security flaw as another commenter pointed out. It's not like there aren't many other chat apps. If you wanna make your own chat app, you can. I don't see Telegram being closed source as an obstacle to any potential chat app developer.

I mean, sure, it's one of the best ones out there. If it were open, I can see how people could just potentially install it on their server, press run, change some stuff on Plus or any other open source app and just chat as if they were on Telegram.

But........... I mean, it's not like we need that. It would be convenient, but I can see how it would fail:

We would need to trust the server of whoever hosts it. Which is not bad per se, as we already have to trust Telegram servers. But imagine if people started hosting their servers, and state-sponsored companies started making their own servers, and telling people to use them. ""It's Telegram! It's secure!"", but then everyone who wants can just install a backdoor.

Which is an understandable fear, and it's even valid for Telegram servers proper. But Telegram is not the best chat app. It's not e2e encrypted anyway for groups of people, and it's not multi-device e2e encryption, which has already proven possible with Signal.

I don't think Telegram servers would provide much, technology-wise, to chat developers; only for people wanting to run their own clones.

One thing I do see as a possible advantage of having Telegram servers be public is that people could potentially do pull requests to improve stuff, and people could see if the infrastructure is well done or whether it's all just spaghetti code bound to fail in a year due to lack of proper developers. There have been many failures lately, with people servers going dark every once in a while. I ask myself, can they really handle 500m people? We could only answer that if the servers were OS'd.

I also don't think that the fear of authoritarian regimes banning Telegram and launching their own equivalents is very valid. They can already do that. As I said, there are plenty of chat apps available. The Chinese government already did this, banned Telegram and allowed WeChat, where they can censor people. Worst case scenario, you tell people to use a VPN when they go into Telegram, and ask them to check that their API endpoints are correct. Eh, this is one of those things that sounds reasonable but really isn't.

Linux vs Windows, I'll take my chances with Linux any day; because it's open, a lot of eyes can be on it, and a lot of eyes are on it.

One thing that would still be an improvement though is a better commit workflow for the android client rather than massive commits for everything in an entire version. Oh, I didn't know that Telegram was leader in Iran. Okay, that changes things. well, there was a government knock-off too. In my honest opinion, no knock-off justifies closing the source code. Transparency and openness is more important than the posibillity of bootlegs But how does it help with transparency? As Durov has said, there is no way to vetify what is running on their servers."

I don’t like that you have the power to private a person from their OWN messages, be it media or normal text, that they sent to you, and maybe don’t have anywhere else. Also this feature could be used for gaslighting others. Is this done for privacy reasons? Wouldn’t privacy be the control of your own data? Does anyone think the pros of this feature outweigh the cons?;2021-01-09 12:40:55;"I think it's a matter of philosophy here.

Imagine I am your friend and we have a long chat about how you cheated on you partner and don't know what to do. Then you ask me not to tell her about it, and I answer that if she asks I'll only tell her about what I said in that conversation. Am I really protecting your privacy? Are my responses only my data and tell nothing about you?

I think that Telegram has this rather strong approach to privacy according to which is better to risk people abusing their policy rather than not giving full control.

It surely feels extreme, but then I remember Telegram has been used by people living in countries with authoritarian regimes, and in that case it definitely makes more sense. As in, you had a chat with your friends criticising the government and then you hear they got arrested. Being able to delete all the messages from all devices sure is useful then. I feel awesome I think this addition to Telegram is very good, because there are times when we would like to erase certain words that we have written and have the power to erase it is welcome, but as this type of features the vast majority of people do not use them and many times they remain to be used by a handful of users If you want to avoid this problem you could fork the client...

However, Telegram implemented chat export at the same time of this feature (on desktop). Don’t like it. Can be abused and secret chats already had similar feature. I don't like it. I feel my phone is my property. I dont like it either That example put things more in perspective, and of course I wouldn’t deny that it is useful for some people sometimes. But I like the fact that our chats are like our archives and you put media there, memories, proof that *that one sexual encounter was actually consensual* etc. Besides, everyone should be a bit responsible for what they say and share with friends, if you tell something that private, you should probably trust that person enough to do so, cause you know, exports of chats and screenshots still exist. If you want the upmost privacy, you should be using private chats anyway. I feel like this feature in normal chats could be more abused than useful. In case of other messaging apps there are special mooded apps which you can basically use to create a fake conversation with anyone.

If you dislike this feature of telegram then just use secret chats. In case of other messaging apps there are special mooded apps which you can basically use to create a fake conversation with anyone.

Can Telegram implement a free data for text messages feature in the future similar to Messenger?;0;ktl692;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ktl692/can_telegram_implement_a_free_data_for_text/;3;"In my country currently Messenger supports a ""Free Data"" feature which means as long as you are using mobile data and there is a signal, you can receive and send text messages without being subscribed to any data plan. Photos and videos won't load because they are not included.

I think this is the reason when it comes to messaging applications, Messenger is still dominant here. I've been in a couple of situations as well as my friends where we do use Telegram but it so happens that when we are outside and don't have any data plan we pretty much use Messenger because it is free.

Do you think Telegram would consider adding such a feature? Of course with the wide scope of features it has, I would make it clear that only text messages in general are covered by the free data. This includes private messages, group messages and even channels. For less complications, bots would not be covered. A message would appear saying that you need data enabled to use the bot.

Honestly, I can't believe that not a single popular messaging application such as WhatsApp or Signal even supports free text messages. It's such a deal breaker. Like I mentioned, even as a Telegram user it has come in clutch for me in some situations because of the fact that it is free.";2021-01-09 08:55:01;"I'm pretty sure that's a service thing and not an app thing. Its your mobile company service that sees you are using Messenger and lets you use it without much data or charging you. that’s up to your carrier, not Telegram. Here on México happen the same thing with AT&T, basically they (both companies) have an agreement, and Facebook (owner of Messenger) pay for your mobile data consumption, in exchange for you know... Your personal data... 

The navigation data are not really free, you are paying with your personal data, Unfortunately the privacy are turning into a privilege and not in the human right that it's supposed to be... If you want privacy, pay for it, and in this case, the way is paying for your navigation mobile data."

No. Signal has it though.

> Or just on secret chat as an opt-in for each new convo you want to start?

No. Signal has it though.

>2- Is there a way to make groups E2E encryption?

No. Signal's groups are always E2EE.

>3- A friend that uses telegram informed me you can delete your entire DM  history. Does this also applies to the server logs of your account?

You can send Telegram server delete a delete Signal, but there's no way to verify that all copies of that message (including backup tapes) are actually removed. E2EE would solve this problem.

>4- How much of your history and info does the Telegram servers actually hold of your info?

At least as much as you can access yourself. So at least everything you haven't deleted. But in theory nothing prevents the server from storing everything forever.

>5- How exposed would a group channel be in case someone reports it for  any reason? Would a moderator of Telegram be allowed immediate access to  its entire logs and conversation, user list and join dates?

Nobody here can answer that. That's Telegram's internal policy of who's allowed to do what. If you're asking if there's a technical limitation the existence of which you can verify, then no, there's nothing that prevents them from accessing the entire conversation history of the group. I see. So essentially the ""security"" of Telegram comes from the fact they dont really bend over for anyone the way apps like discord or whatsapp does? I actually expected Telegram to be a lot more secure than this. >So essentially the ""security"" of Telegram comes from the fact they dont  really bend over for anyone the way apps like discord or whatsapp does?

Perhaps not. There's really no way to be sure of what they do and don't do with the data in backend. Telegram can also be outstanding in its moral principles of not giving out data, and be horribly insecure (anyone can hack the server and steal messages) at the same time.

And that's the problem. We shouldn't judge Telegram by developers' good intentions, but from the robust implementation of cryptography, that is, always-on E2EE. They fail to deliver so no matter how big of a celebrity you are, it doesn't really transit to actual privacy, no matter how much security is claimed to be about perception (which explains a lot for the fanboyism and fallacious logic such as ""Telegram is banned in some country, therefore it's secure"", here.) I see. A bit of a shame to hear my expectations were a bit too high. After all at least Signal claimed (keyword) when they got Subpoena'd that they kept nothing of user data other than date and phone number registered and last login date, and im not fond of Telegram not being rather open about what it holds. Not to mention even in their FAQ it states that a single report of a group can allow its moderators to immediatly try to pry open the entire group regardless as secret as it wants to be to find the reason of the report. >After all at least Signal *claimed*

That's why transparency is so nice thing. See Page 13 of

[https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3120046-Open-Whisper-Documents-0.html#document/p4/a320485](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3120046-Open-Whisper-Documents-0.html#document/p4/a320485)

To see what Signal returned to comply with the subpoena. :D I can imagine the face of the prosecutor: ""This is absolutely fucking useless""

>Not to mention even in their FAQ it states that a single report of a  group can allow its moderators to immediatly try to pry open the entire  group regardless as secret as it wants to be to find the reason of the  report.

In general you probably don't want to be doing something illegal in general, but sure, there's plenty of unjust laws so Telegram might not be ideal for social progress, especially if there's uninvited big brother looking at the messages as opposed to just mods checking for hate speech, cp etc. >Telegram not being rather open about what it holds.

Oh, regarding this, they hold everything you can access after reinstalling the app without creating any backups. Basically all non-secret chats. They hold all the metadata too because the message timestamps, what convo they're part of etc. are retained to make it accessible to you too.

But openness is indeed a massive problem. Telegram doesn't release its' financial reports, which begs the question, why? What do they have to hide?

This is the way: Privacy for the individual, transparency for the institutions.

This is not supposed to be the way: Transparency to user messages to server, privacy for Telegram's financial reports."

This is incorrect. E2EE chats still go through Telegram's servers. E2EE means Telegram can't access the content of that chat (without MITM attack that you can detect if you compare the public key fingerprints). But because the messages still go through Telegram's servers, Telegram knows the metadata, i.e. when you're having secret chats, with whom, how much, at what time, who you talk to before talking in the secret chat, who you talk after when you talk in the secret chat etc. Section [3.3.3](https://telegram.org/privacy#3-3-3-media-in-secret-chats) \- Media in secret chats:

*When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being  uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the  server. This key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this  time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient. They can  then download and decipher the file. This means that the file is  technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of  random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the  recipient. We don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no  idea which particular chat it belongs to. We periodically purge this  random data from our servers to save disk space.*

They don't know anything about sender/recipient, or file's metadata, but since for every app there's a need for internet, we have an IP leak, with which they can compare to their base and see which users used secret chats(solvable by VPN&Fake number), we could apply same to Whatsapp and Signal.

This goes to media messages,.

In Telegram though, all your text messages are sent via P2P connection(directly, without Telegram server), Telegram could know when you started secret chat since there's a need for handshake(idk if there's mitigation for that, f.e send secret chat request masking it look like another cloud message), but it will never know when you ended it, since after handshake devices are in autonomous communication.

All these flaws could be fixed by using peer-to-peer connected network, like Bitcoin, messenger, f.e. BitMessage, or Retroshare(in addition if you a white IP, or IPV6) but then messengers wouldn't be that fast.

So if you're bad guy(clever one which started secret chat months before doing bad things and using VPN with fake number), sent some bad things in Secret Chat to another clever bad guy, then deleted it, then caught for suspicion, no one can slap you, because no one has any evidence, no IP, no number, no messages. The only secure way would be this.

This is not about Telegram, this is about all messengers, there's no universal one. >They don't know anything about sender/recipient, or file's metadata,

Wrong. They know the maximum size of the file. But that's not the point. I'm not talking about metadata such as EXIF-data in some image.

Of course Telegram knows the sender and recipient of the file. There's no way to hide that information without registering and using the app with throw-away phone number and exclusive usage via Tor. 

>solvable by VPN&Fake number

Yeah this but with Tor. But nobody's doing that. I know I can get prepaid SIM by just visiting the local kiosk, but I won't. And I'm a security researcher. Nobody does that unless their lives depend on it. Also, even if I did that, none of my peers would do that.

>we could apply same to Whatsapp and Signal.

Signal doesn't store your metadata. There's court proof of it: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3120046-Open-Whisper-Documents-0.html#document/p4/a320485

Telegram stores your metadata. This is evident from simply reinstalling Telegram on a new device.

>In Telegram though, all your text messages are sent via P2P connection(directly, without Telegram server), 

If that's true, why can I download past conversations with my friend even when both of us remove the app, and then reinstall Telegram? You're spreading misinformation or if you're aware of it, disinformation.

>Telegram could know when you started secret chat since there's a need for handshake

The secret chats have offline-message functionality. Therefore they're not p2p. If it was p2p, that would mean your contact needs to be online to receive messages, which is horrible from perspective of battery usage and usability. It would be like the very early days of MSN messenger when you had to call your buddy and say, ""let's chat in MSN at 7pm!"" They're not that stupid.

Since traffic goes through Telegram server, Telegram knows the metadata about how much you talk over secret chats. And they also know when you and your buddy switch from cloud chat to the secret chat. Why would they use cloud chat? Because it's not cross platform. Right now my Telegram desktop client without secret chats is alt-tab away. My secret chat is on my smartphone, that's 25,9cm (I measured), pin code unlock, and opening the app -away. There's **NO WAY** I'm going to use secret chats with my smartphone when I have my fingers on my computer's keyboard. Smartphone keyboards suck and I need to be productive. And I again I'm a security researcher. From my experience, Secret Chats are good for one thing: shutting up debate about Telegram's default security.

>All these flaws could be fixed by using peer-to-peer connected network, like Bitcoin, 

Bitcoin is not p2p but decentralized system.

>So if you're bad guy(clever one which started secret chat months before doing bad things and using VPN with fake number), sent some bad things in Secret Chat to another clever bad guy, then deleted it, then caught for suspicion, no one can slap you, because no one has any evidence, no IP, no number, no messages. The only secure way would be this.

Telegram can always hand out metadata about secret chats. They can't provide the content however. If you want to remove metadata you need an Onion Service based messenger like [Briar](https://briarproject.org/), [Ricochet](https://ricochet.im/), [Cwtch](https://cwtch.im/) or [TFC](https://github.com/maqp/tfc). Those are actual p2p, and indeed suffer from the necessity of having to have both endpoints powered at the same time. The reason I know this is, I wrote TFC. >Wrong. They know the maximum size of the file. But that's not the point. I'm not talking about metadata such as EXIF-data in some image.

In first versions of Whatsapp its servers knew which extension is being sent, I meant that metadata. Of course it will now the size of it, there's no workaround of it, what you expect, that app should add random bytes to file to make it harder to identify file size? That's not the point, but you indicate my answer as wrong.

>Of course Telegram knows the sender and recipient of the file. There's  no way to hide that information without registering and using the app  with throw-away phone number and exclusive usage via Tor.

I'm not sure about this also, they wrote it, to be fair I didn't fully think when I wrote this, but you're true, they know who sent media.

>Yeah this but with Tor. But nobody's doing that. I know I can get  prepaid SIM by just visiting the local kiosk, but I won't. And I'm a  security researcher. Nobody does that unless their lives depend on it.  Also, even if I did that, none of my peers would do that.

I don't mean that everybody should do it, I wanted to say that anonymity can be achieved by Telegram also, if you want to propose new IP version without address pool, I'd be glad to hear your ideas.

>If that's true, why can I download past conversations with my friend  even when both of us remove the app, and then reinstall Telegram? You're  spreading misinformation or if you're aware of it, disinformation.

We are talking about Secret Chats, I think you didn't read my message.

>Signal doesn't store your metadata. There's court proof of it:

Signal knows only about my phone number, date of creation of account, and last time of last login, but Telegram didn't even give something to court, yes if it'd then it would be catastrophic and I'd definitely deleted all of my messages, and account on Telegram.But let's look it on the other hand, if we are only using secret chats, then Telegram would have same data as Signal, date of last login, number, and date of creation, in exception for contact list which is hashed in Signal, but it only creates an illusion of security, since numbers can be brute-forced.It'll have a list of used stickers, which don't bear confidential information.And our cloud groups. And this is the one advantage in which Signal wins: It has e2ee group chats. Which will come to Telegram in future, developers have plans for this.Developers didn't place e2ee in Desktop app because PCs are more easily compromised by viruses than phones,  but that feature exists in Unigram from Microsoft Store.

>The secret chats have offline-message functionality. Therefore they're not p2p.  If it was p2p, that would mean your contact needs to be online to receive messages .

Yes, they are, Telegram only needs both participants online to exchange encryption keys. After that you can send messages even if the other party is  offline: your message will be transferred to Telegram cloud (end-to-end  encrypted) and kept until the other party goes online. But if both participants are online their text messages will be delivered directly, bypassing server.

Yes it'd be awesome to have an option to send media files directly also, but not everybody has stable high-speed internet connection.

>Bitcoin is not p2p but decentralized system.

Draw attention: I said ""p2p connected network"", like in Bitcoin, I know what Bitcoin is.

I trust Tor because I live outside US, and doing nothing against US, but if I did something bad-ass then, since Tor project is funded by American Government, it's not likable that next time main Tor relay will give me a trusted Guard node.

That sound like paranoia I know, but Tor is not a panacea.

What offends me, that you said(with many other people) about Telegram(apple):

""*It's an apple, I don't like it because it grows only in Summer, it's round, I wan't it to grow square, and I wan't it each to be 1kg.*""

Now original form:

""*This is Telegram, I don't like it because it knows my IP address, I want it to deliver my messages without internet, through air, if it doesn't, then it's a bad app which can't ensure privacy and can not be trusted, let's use Signal, it's like Whatsapp, and it's created by an American, anything american can be trusted, it's not like it's creator was a Russian.* ""

I know it's stupid, but that's how it is. > In first versions of Whatsapp its servers knew which extension is being sent, I meant that metadata.

So file type. Yeah, we're talking about different things.

>what you expect

No I did not expect Telegram to do something about a fundamental problem. It was merely a proof by counter-example to your claim that Telegram can hide all file metadata. But if you want to cherry-pick the types of metadata, let us know what you exclude.

>I'm not sure about this also, they wrote it, 

Then it would be their job to explain how they hide it. Consider e.g. how Signal discloses sealed sender transparently https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/

>I wanted to say that anonymity can be achieved by Telegram also

Sure, I agree, if you want you can do it. I actually wrote a guide for people in Hong Kong how to do that https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/c23xjl/guide_for_communicating_safely/ But as you can see it's anything but easy. If you want anonymity, you'll want an onion service based messenger.

>if you want to propose new IP version without address pool, I'd be glad to hear your ideas.

There's no way to reinvent the wheel. Telegram doesn't hide metadata nor should it try. It features low-latency calls so its threat model wrt metadata is the same as in the case of Signal. The server can do it if it wants. The difference is Signal actively chooses not to do that, and Telegram passively lets that happen. But both could do it if they wanted to, and if you as a user want to prevent that you shouldn't try Tor+PrepaidNo, but OnionService stuff.

>We are talking about Secret Chats, I think you didn't read my message.

You said ""In Telegram though, all your **text** messages are sent via P2P connection""

You did not say ""In Telegram though, all your **secret** messages are sent via P2P connection""

That's the problem with Telegram. Mixing two different protocols, calling both MTProto, and not being specific when you say ""all text messages are p2p"". It's bullshit like this I had another chat about why Telegram isn't actually secure by default with one my my peers.

>Yes, they are, Telegram only needs both participants online to exchange encryption keys.

Where in https://core.telegram.org/techfaq does it say end-to-end encrypted chats are also p2p. Or are you confusing yourself by thinking E2EE is p2p encryption or something like that?

> After that you can send messages even if the other party is offline: your message will be transferred to Telegram cloud (end-to-end encrypted) and kept until the other party goes online. But if both participants are online their text messages will be delivered directly, bypassing server.

Citation needed.

>I trust Tor because I live outside US, and doing nothing against US, but if I did something bad-ass then, since Tor project is funded by American Government, it's not likable that next time main Tor relay will give me a trusted Guard node.

Tor Project is independent of US Government. Are your Tor connections being blocked?

>Tor is not a panacea.

Nobody ever claimed it to be. To quote GCHQ, Tor is still the best option https://i2.wp.com/privacy-pc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tor-is-still-the-king.jpg

>""It's an apple, I don't like it because it grows only in Summer, it's round, I wan't it to grow square, and I wan't it each to be 1kg.""

As per above, I already explained my reasoning why the metadata aspect isn't of major importance. Neither has strong technical protection against metadata. That requires Tor. But Signal has better **policy** when it comes to handling metadata. So there's an **incremental** difference

You're misinterpreting my case. Here is my gripe with Telegram:

There is no architectural limitation to make E2EE cross-platform, enabled by default, and available for non-supergroups. Signal has already shown it can be done. The only thing preventing it is Telegram developers' **unwillingness**. 

The difference in Signal's E2EE implementation is not incremental (like better algorithm for hashing), it's fundamental design principle: In Telegram E2EE chats are a feature like stickers you can use or not use. In Signal E2EE is a property of every message, every conversation, every feature, be it stickers, location sharing, media, call, group call or video call. E.g. Telegram has E2EE calls, but https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats are not E2EE. That's the main difference, and that's also what matters.

You being offended by me presenting verifiable, well-reasoned criticism is perhaps something you should work by yourself. I'm not against you or anyone else. I'm for Telegram users' right to privacy."

I was just wondering if it was on the road map, as many of incoming from other apps users are used to this feature Why so ? It wouldn't affect any of already exiting features. It shapes the conversation in a reaction oriented way. I dislike it when writing a long message to someone on discord or messenger only to come back later and see a emoji reaction. It's a way to avoid sending a message. It's fit for social media or large group channel, but not for message applications imo. It's absence is one of the reason I like Telegram so much over messenger or discord. Why not at least add it for group chats then? We have some big (30-40 people) group chats

Why should I choose telegram over signal;8;ktbe1x;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ktbe1x/why_should_i_choose_telegram_over_signal/;22;[deleted];2021-01-08 23:47:03;"Yes, it is true that Telegram doesn't use end to end encryption by default (mostly due to how some features would be either difficult or impossible to implement in such a system) it uses server side encryption 

About the Ads I'd recommend you to read on this more deeply, but the takeaway is that the ad platform that will be implemented into Telegram is designed to only ever be on big channels and not user chats/groups (and channel owners will get a share of the revenue as well) and according to Telegram this ad platform should/will not be invasive to users (as in no tracking among other things)

I honestly couldn't recommend either one, both have their advantages and disadvantages, on Telegram the server code is currently still proprietary, so one does have to simply believe on Durov's words when it comes to user privacy 

I'd say if privacy is of your utmost concern then I suppose Signal is the way to go, but if you value a richer messaging experience a bit more then I'd say use Telegram

To anyone that reads this please don't interpret this as me either hating Telegram or promoting Signal, as a person I have my reasonable concerns towards Telegram, while I do not distrust Durov right now I often try to take things with a grain of salt as I don't like to be considered a blind fan/believer of something/someone it’s usable, unlike Signal I've found Signal to be slower, buggy and overall not as reliable. It is still usable and more secure. But for me the lack of a good desktop version (no, I will never accept electron as being good) and the lack of people on it make Telegram my main app. There's a few main key differences and reasons. For security and encryption Signal is better.

Signal has been around for longer, and has a good end to end encryption which is used app wide while also having a way to see if it's well implemented. Signal's UI and Telegram's are on par, even if Signal just throws you in without letting you know how the hell you contact your friends (But Whatsapp was in the same boat before, so that's not here nor there). They also do group and one on one calls, and you can make stickers and get stickers, tho making is exclusive to desktop. Now for groups it isn't all too incredible, it doesn't let you have a gigantic group (Tho most people won't care for it) and it also doesn't have the best management of group chats.

Telegram is an easy enough transition from Whatsapp, and it's encryption is strong, just not used app wide, E2EE is used in all calls and in all Secret Chats, while normal conversations are only server side encrypted as far as i know. Aside from that they have animated stickers (Tho they're a pain in the ass to make, just accept what you get) and a cross-platform way to make stickers. In terms of groups, large groups can be made and managed easily on Telegram, for up to 200.000 members if you like, and you can make roles for members and set permissions for those role, it's a much easier time to manage.
It has custom theming, let's you use background wallpaper, and also can do a lot of what Whatsapp could already do. 

If you want purely privacy with good UI, but a bit less featured than Whatsapp or Telegram, and want it to just a select group of people go for Signal. If you want to interact with large communities, groups, and have the same comforts of Whatsapp, tho a little less private than Signal, but now a days with Facebook looming over Whatsapp way more private than Whatsapp then go for Telegram.

And if pure privacy is what you truly truly need, self-host a Matrix instance and use it to message people, that's the best you can do while losing a lot of stuff from both Signal and Telegram, but you won't have to trust any company or person since you will be the one hosting the thing you can trust yourself.

*Edited for specification of encryption to some Telegram stuff, and to add Matrix as and Addendum. Telegram is super fast, easy to use and its apps are great (especially the macOS and iOS ones). To me it’s a good mix of convenience and security. I think I’d even use it if it didn’t have any privacy features considering how well made it is compared to Messenger/WhatsApp/Signal and the others Signal is the best. Telegram has been criticized by security experts for not having E2EE by default and using a homegrown encryption protocol that is not as reviewed and endorsed as Signal protocol. Even WhatsApp is more secure than Telegram. >Yes, it is true that Telegram doesn't use end to end encryption by default

/thread, basically.

>if you value a richer messaging experience a bit more then I'd say use Telegram

Signal has stickers, GIFs, links, location sharing, media sharing... The only things it's missing considering usability wrt. Telegram are more scalable desktop client window and usernames. And both of those are coming.

>I have my reasonable concerns towards Telegram

Same. Neither hate nor fanboyism is mature. People need to understand Telegram's security isn't fundamentally limited by anything other than developers' unwillingness to lock themselves out of your data. The only place where E2EE is impractical are channels and supergroups. But Signal has already shown E2EE can be done by default, for cross-platform chats, and group chats with up to 1001 members. Telegram upgrades to supergroups at mere 200 members. It's okay to have only non-super groups as E2EE chats. You lose expectation of privacy anyway when you switch to massive groups. People don't consider 500 member groups private anymore. But a 60 person group of close peers is. **Let's make Telegram better. I only advocate Signal here to tell you that Telegram can be much more secure and remain as usable as it is. And meanwhile, it's safer to stay on Signal's side, and wait for Telegram to catch up.** I’ve tried to send a message to my other phone with another number and the messages wasn’t sent. Is this what you’re saying about? >it doesn't let you have a gigantic group

Doesn't matter for 99% of private communication.

>Telegram is an easy enough transition from Whatsapp, and it's encryption is strong, just not used app wide

And you don't think this is a major security issue?

>tho a little less private than Signal

Consider for a moment what little here means. If Telegram's servers are hacked

* Every message you've ever sent to any group is compromised
* Every message you've ever sent from Windows/Linux desktop client is compromised
* Every message you didn't explicitly opt-in for the extremely inconvenient end-to-end encrypted secret chats is compromised.

That's not ""little less private"", that's ""Facebook Messenger"" level private. Would you use Facebook Messenger? Of course not you're smart. But understanding Telegram is on par with that helps you a lot in understanding why every security expert tells you to use Signal.

[Every Fortune 500 company has already been hacked](https://www.businessinsider.com/security-mikko-hypponen-all-fortune-500-companies-hacked-2015-10?r=US&IR=T). Is Pavel Durov better at harderning his servers than every major company in the world? What credentials he has, ability to create ubiquitous end-to-end encrypted protocol? No that's not it. Ability to create a secure protocol from scratch? No the IND-CCA stuff. Just no. I don't believe for a second this wont' happen. When it happens, you'll be praying you'd understood the fire you're playing with ATM. You can still use e2ee, if you want. The feature is there. Nobody's stopping you. >whatsapp

>secure personally, i’ve had no issues sending and receiving messages on TG/Signal. it’s just that the Signal app feels so clunky, is very barebones, and handles stuff like messages in a group chat while you’re scrolled up - small stuff that TG gets right. like it’s a PoC more than an actual product for people to use daily. >Consider for a moment what little here means.

I don't think you understand how encryption works, look up the RSA algorithm in regards to secret chats, and then that Telegram stores their stuff encrypted on their servers. That article you link to doesn't state how/what was hacked, most of the time it's social engineering, old employees, etc. and a vast majority of the time that's unencrypted data.  


Stealing encrypted data is worthless if you can't do anything with it, and I am sure we'd have heard about leaks by now considering how many use the platform. Would still like some proper audits as well, but that's a different discussion. The feature is only available for 1 to 1 chats. And as I said, the E2EE uses a homebrewn protocol that has been criticized by cryptographers. Hi, I'm using Telegram on Linux desktop, mainly for group chats.

* How can I enable E2EE for desktop chats?
* How can I enable E2EE for group chats?
* Is there a setting that let's me use E2EE for everything by default when I create a new chat?
* Is there a setting that lets me prevent people from connecting to me without initializing a secret chat?

Signal does this all automatically, but Telegram doesn't so maybe you can help me configure my Telegram client, considering you're so sure of yourself. Yes. WhatsApp is secure (but not private). For me Signal is unusable because I only know one other person who uses it. I enjoy Telegram as I have a lot of contacts on there, but most of all for me, I like being able to also use it on my tablet. I believe it is possible to have the cloud aspect as well as keeping the E2E encryption. This is something Threema is allegedly working to implement. I'm hoping Telegram will also persue this. >I don't think you understand how encryption works, look up the RSA algorithm in regards to secret chats,

You really have no idea who you're talking to :D

Okay. Secret chats don't use RSA. See [https://core.telegram.org/file/811140633/4/hHw6Zy2DPyQ.109500/cabc10049a7190694f](https://core.telegram.org/file/811140633/4/hHw6Zy2DPyQ.109500/cabc10049a7190694f) ""Secret Chat generated via **DH**"" which means [Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange), not RSA.

>look up the RSA algorithm in regards to secret chats

Group chats do not use RSA, nor are Group chats ""secret chats"".

>and then that Telegram stores their stuff encrypted on their servers

Okay, let's say I send a cloud-message to Telegram server. Telegram strips the in-transit (cloud) MTProto encryption and now has the plaintext message. How exactly does Telegram store that message on its disk? List me all the types of memory the key is loaded to on that server, to make storing the data on disk in encrypted form possible.

>That article you link to doesn't state how/what was hacked, most of the  time it's social engineering, old employees, etc. and a vast majority of  the time that's unencrypted data.

It also doesn't explicitly say encrypting the data is sufficient. It's not. I have [personally exploited](https://i.ibb.co/FJ7Q6Fb/4-otrsk-copy.png) a full-disk encrypted OS, and lifted private keys from that endpoint.

>Stealing encrypted data is worthless if you can't do anything with it

Let's focus on the key management problem first. So answer me the question above, how is the message received through MTProto written on disk? Where is the entire encryption key located at that precise moment?

EDIT: Since you never replied and seemingly just downvoted this post, I'm going to answer for the crowd:

That piece of plaintext the server will log, will require something called database encryption key. Encryption is a set of operations that takes the plaintext message, and converts it to undecipherable mess using an algorithm and a key, inside the CPU. So the CPU must have access to the entire key, and the key is therefore at least in the RAM of the server, and most likely in the cache memory of the CPU itself.

There's two cases where Telegram's key can reside under multiple jurisdictions, 1. an at-rest copy of the key is stored in multiple shares or 2. data is split in RAM of multiple servers via [RDMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_direct_memory_access). **Neither** prevents a local CPU in a single data center from requesting the entire key however. And the key is used all the time, for every individual message must be stored on disk.

Now, when a CPU runs instructions it has two [modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_modes): **Kernel** and **User.** A hacker that finds its way to the computer can use a vulnerability in the server to do a [privilege escalation attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation) This doesn't require breaking encryption of any kind, just exploit an unpatched hole in the operating system. Once that is done, the attacker can run code in Kernel mode. To quote that Wiki article

>In kernel mode, the **CPU may perform any operation allowed by its  architecture**; any instruction may be executed, **any I/O operation**  initiated, **any area of memory accessed**, and so on.

So the compromised CPU perform all necessary I/O operations to load the encrypted database, it can also send it via network to the attacker. Since the database encryption key is in the system's memory, and since ""any area of memory can be accessed"", that by definition includes the database encryption key.

So the attacker can steal both the database key and the database itself.

So yeah, I understand how cryptography works and I also understand how computers work. :) The protocol has been criticized because it's not Signal's. If any cryptographer thinks they can break it, there's a $200,000 [reward](https://telegram.org/crypto_contest) waiting for them. That's like saying i got a randomly generated 56 digit password but everyone knows what that it. i have the same scenario with iMessage/WhatsApp vs Signal and Telegram lol"

They ask for facebook or tweeter account. I thought that freedom-fighters are escaping from those rotten platforms. I am using Telegram, to have a bit of privacy. I deleted my facebook 10 years ago, never had tweeter. Am I a bad person because of that? >You really need to control at least two social media pages with same name

I control at least 10 other pages, just not the crappy ones that are needed. Of course no, but if you're migrating from other platforms, it'd be a wise thing to learn some things about your new platform.

It doesn't crack anonymity if you verify your accounts there, if you have a brand name.

But since you deleted facebook 10 years ago, and there were no Telegram at the moment, it's an exclusion rather than a rule.

As far as I know facebook, twitter don't have bots to acquire usernames, if you have, for example, same name in youtube or instagram, sorry that you had bad experience with your username, but there're still hot cool untaken names, so hurry up! :)"

Please telegram update your security and privacy to at least match signal. I've got friends and family wanting to switch and now I've read up on both im struggling to find a reason not too. All the furries are panicking now. Use Signal . Telegram is just marketing Same in Brazil, i switched either way and got shamed over it. Imagine shaming people for a PM app. Guarda l'ho proposto ai miei genitori che adesso lo adorano

Lo uso con i miei amici più intimi, ti renderai conto che alla fine che 10 persone occupano il 90% delle tue conversazioni 7 years over here. Back then most people didn’t know about it. I simply uninstalled WhatsApp and forced whoever wanted to contact me to use telegram.. guess what, all my frequent contacts permanently moved to telegram too. It’s impossible to not love it with all its features, privacy and customisations

Edit: also back then I was still living in Italy too Similar in Spain. Maybe I'm lucky with the friends I have, but quite a few have telegram and happily use that with me. I'm gonna send everyone I talk with on whatsapp a message saying I'll be deleting whatsapp soon, but that they can message me on signal and telegram. And of course I have email, SMS, and they can call me. So if they want to get in touch there are many ways to do so.

The only real issue is my football group, which is organised on whatsapp. It's a large group for 5v5 games. There are games twice a week and you just have to add yourself to the list on a first come first serve basis. The place we usually play at is closed because of covid for now, but when things are better I'd like to start playing again. Not sure what I'll do. I think I will ask someone in the group if they have signal/telegram and if they can add me to the list when I'd like to play.

There are many people in the group and I'm not a core member by any means, so there's no way I can ask them to switch to signal or telegram.

Anyone with ideas of how to overcome this? The only thing to do for that is making the E2E everywhere. And that's just going backward, man. Stop that already.

Look at the most repeated complaints about the Signal app. Most of those problems are related to its architecture and limitations because of Its E2E scheme. 

https://i.imgur.com/qo7TjzK.png

Signal will only dream to have features like big groups, big media file size, instant sync of all your messages whenever you install the app (and not having an empty list because you forgot to make a backup and changed your phone); not worrying about deciding what to save or not to free space of your phone because everything it's stored on your phone. 

For everything else, Telegram is giving you lots of control of the footprint you leave using their services: letting you clear every chat in both sides whenever you want, HIDE your phone number, not allowing people not in your contact list to be able to find you by having your phone number; having a secret chat that is device-specific (if someone gets access to your account it won't be able to see whatever you were saying through that) and many other things they're redefining to give you tools. 

Secret chats even make you more aware of your privacy and actions. It makes you think like ""Hey, I don't want to leave a trace of this conversation, I should use it"". It won't let forward messages, take screenshots, create backups, etc.

They even gave you proper reproducible builds for android and iOS. Something that Signal haven't done yet (just parts of features in the android app).

I'm not pretending to say Telegram is perfect, I'm just saying that if there's something better than Telegram, IS NOT Signal, I can point out other projects like Matrix or even Threema which doesn't even need a phone number. 

Also the app it's being funded by the OFT: ""An American non-profit corporation to support global Internet freedom technologies."" 

The US government. Think whatever you want to think about that fact. Something positive, maybe something negative or just doesn't matter. Totally up to you. Why don't you get your friends and family to use Telegram? It's a much nicer app. Telegram is just great functionalities and convenience. Foda mano Ur legend, I have to try. The point with hiding your number is what's holding me back to really embrace signal. I didn't even think of the rest of your (good) points. 
I use signal for sms tho, so if someone in my contacts starts using it it's cool. Telegram is what we have all used for year's but some want to switch having learned it is not encrypted or as private as we had thought Ew again at this reply , you might as well stay on WhatsApp, shame on you That's interesting.

Both apps should be able to refresh in the background at the same rate.;2021-01-08 18:23:12;"This!

I see one more thing too: when someone sends you 8 messages on Telegram (iOS) and you let screen is locked - it only shows you like 5-6 of them, not all 8... that’s really annoying. Telegram is always the fastest across devices in my experience. The moment it is sent on one device, it shows up on my computer. In my case, WhatsApp load messages until I open it. Yeah just ran a little experiment, I spammed 14 messages really fast, and it only showed 10 notifications in the other device Yeah but I’m talking about push notifications, not the fact that if you have the app open on two devices it shows fast. I know that. I’m talking if u have your phone locked, and someone sends u a text, from the moment they hit send, till your phone gets a notification, there’s a considerable delay in comparison with WhatsApp, which is almost instant Thank you ;) so I’m not crazy. I don’t know if they’re aware of the problem Wouldn't that be a OS specific thing? If it's fast when your phone is unlocked, it wouldn't have anything to do with the speed on Telegram's end No, even if it’s unlocked, and you’re in another app, it takes quite a while to push a notification. Regardless of locked/unlocked is the same speed What is quite a while? Less than 10 seconds? Less than 2? Just trying to figure out why you'd want 18 notifications if rapid fire message from one chat if already got 10, would rather Telegram slowed down as many notifications as would be annoying, but if 18 messages over 10 minutes and only got it a minute after each other, that's bad. Haven't noticed that though. I would just like it to be more responsive. It’s not about quantity, of course if you have already 12 notifications from that chat, you don’t need the next ones to be super fast. That’s not the issue tho. Lemme put you in perspective so you know the case that most happens to me. I’m in a chat in telegram with someone, we’re both there chatting at the same time, pretty responsive. As I’m finishing my next sentence I get a notification from any other app, so I hit send and then open the notification from the other app, hoping that when the person in telegram replies to that one last message I sent, I get the notification fast, so I can jump right in. So I’m in the other app for like 40 seconds or even a minute, and then I get a notification from that person in telegram, I open it RIGHT AWAY and the other person isn’t even online, sent the message like half a minute ago, i wasn’t replying fast anymore, so they went to check something else. Not everyone can be staring at a chat for 40 seconds waiting for the other person to get online and reply. None of this would happen if the push notification system was as responsive at WhatsApp for example, or any other app actually. The only one that feels this slow is Telegram, and it hinders my communication sometimes with people, cuz it is hard to have a decent back and forth conversation with someone, while checking other stuff.

If I care about privacy, why choose Telegram instead of Signal?;6;kt32h1;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kt32h1/if_i_care_about_privacy_why_choose_telegram/;22;"Genuine question

Title";2021-01-08 17:05:48;"Why not both?

But to answer your question, the main criticism about Telegram are:

**1.** It's not end-to-end encrypted by default

It doesn't mean messages are not encrypted, by using e2e we sacrifice features like using Telegram in multiple devices. Yet you can use secret-chats which have e2e encryption.

**2.** Telegram uses it's own encryption method.

If you know something about information security it's never run your own encryption. But Telegram has it's reasons about why they created MTProto, main one was achieving good speeds, something important for a messaging app. MTProto specifications are publicly available so security experts can independently audit it (AFAIK).

Anyway Telegram has been around for a while, improvements have been made to the encryption system and given than some powerful governments have tried to ban telegram from their countries one can conclude they couldn't break the encryption.

**3.** Well messages are encrypted but Telegram holds the decryption keys.

Of course this is a big concern, it requires you to trust Telegram, ideally the encryption should work in a way that not even Telegram could decrypt it. So I judge telegram by it's actions in the past.

\- Telegram hasn't enter the Chinese market because they refuse to comply with anti-privacy laws.

\- Governments like Russia and Iran have actively tried to block Telegram access for their citizens. They wouldn't have done that if Telegram handed out data to them or if it had backdoors.

\- Telegram isn't a corporation that benefits from exploiting personal data, it doesn't have a motivation to invade people's privacy. The efforts telegram has done to monetize the app (like TON, or Telegram Payments) never compromised privacy.

\-  By Telegram FAQs:

>The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in  the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up  any data.  
>  
>Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or  block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and  freedom of expression. Telegram can be forced to give up data only if an  issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several  different legal systems around the world.  
>  
>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.

On a final note, personally Telegram is superior to any other messaging app when it comes to user experience, it's familiar to what people know from WhatsApp but improves on many areas (groups limit, files transfer, dark mode, stickers). It attracts people that don't even care about privacy. Many refuse to leave WhatsApp because is where their friends are, but Telegram has the power to attract those friends.

It has been really easy for my friends and family to switch to telegram and I'm happy for them to use a decent app that doesn't give away their personal information. Privacy from who? Telegram is at least not part of the American spy network as far as know (Facebook, Google, amazon, apple etc). And the Russian founder seems to actually care about privacy. Because you can have Secret chats and because **Multiple Devices**, which Signal does not (and probably will never) support I'm a Signal zealot, But telegram has a couple of useful features that can be fine for that platform only. Channels and bots. 

* Channels are good, they can work as a sort of ""in-app twitter"", which to me seems more detrimental, but sure... 
* Bots are also very useful, but of course, know that what you send is not E2E. 
* Truly massive groups. The math for E2E protocols to increase members size is difficult. But this allows to have districts/communities to have common place where to meet. Although I'd suggest using forums or something else.
* Some people believe that having old conversations in the cloud is a good thing.

Of course, these are all compromises one has to make. But features that would be difficult for Signal to implement quickly.

Then, for everything else and regular chat, I'd go for everything always E2E. They key part here is ***""If I care about privacy,""***

The answer is very simple. **If you care about privacy, DO NOT use Telegram.**

Period.

You should use **Signal** or any other app that is as or more committed to privacy.

Telegram is not committed to privacy because it's not end-to-end encrypted by default (E2EE). That means they can read you messages and collect almost all the data that your generate and share on their app.

Yes they have secrets chats which is E2EE, but the vast majority of users don't use secret chats. Telegram uses a lot of deception to mislead the public into believing that they care and are committed to privacy, but they are not.

They collect tons of data about their users. Whether they monetise it or not is irrelevant. The point is they have the data, they continue to collect it, and they continue to refuse to implement E2EE by default. Why?

Because they care more about increasing their user base as fast as possible, than they do about privacy.

Signal is not only E2EE by default but all of its features are E2EE: emojis, gifs, stickers, your contacts, etc...that takes a lot of work that Telegram is not willing to do.

If you want to learn more about how Telegram misleads the public with deceptive language I highly recommend you read  u/maqp2 's [compelling rebuttal](https://graph.org/Why-you-should-stop-reading-Durovs-blog-posts-11-25) to Telegram CEO Pavel Durov's 2017 post, in which he poorly defends not implementing E2EE by default.

u/maqp2 is a cryptographer and sheds blinding light  on Telegram's deception. I am ashamed to admit that I totally bought it at the time too, but I now realize it was total BS.

**If you care about privacy, if that is indeed your motivation in selecting a messaging app, do not use Telegram. They are not trustworthy.** Do not. Use Signal instead. Telegram is not as secure as it claims to be (it does not have E2EE by default and uses a homegrown encryption method). >Why not both?

Because anything that's not E2EE leaks to server and that's not what you want. If your Telegram conversation has messages ""Not here, let's switch to Signal for a moment"", that leaks metadata to Telegram about when you're having secret conversations.

>It doesn't mean messages are not encrypted, by using e2e we sacrifice features like using Telegram in multiple devices.

That's not true. Signal is a living proof of multi-device secret chats for both one-on-one and group chats.

>Telegram uses it's own encryption method.

No it uses its own protocol. ""Method"" too vague a term.

>main one was achieving good speeds,

The AES-IGE (garbage extension) has already been shown to be not at all faster than e.g. AES-GCM (best practice).

Telegram is fast only because it doesn't have E2EE group chats. But as computers (that is your smart phone) get faster via Moore's law, this slowness is reduced on averavge by \~30% every year. That's because encryption doesn't get slower, but mobile network connections and processors get faster. Telegram will at some point stop being noticeably any faster in any size group chat.

>MTProto specifications are publicly available so security experts can independently audit it (AFAIK).

And the results are in. No E2EE for groups by design. If we would say that for Signal, that would mean Signal has a backdoor. So we can argue Telegram comes with a backdoor built-in, and advertised as a speed feature.

MTProto specifications don't mention anything about the fact if the server is hacked, every group message ever sent, that is stored on Telegram servers can leak.

Writing a paper about this would be as stupid as Cellebrite's ""signal hacking tool"" that was just process automation tool that didn't even have the decryption keys.

>Anyway Telegram has been around for a while, improvements have been made to the encryption system

True, they e.g. stopped using the horribly broken SHA-1 hash function and replaced that with SHA256. They also fixed the IND-CCA problem. These two mainly show Telegram developers weren't up to date with their knowledge. But AES-IGE still remains there, and nothing wrt. encrypting groups or chats by default has happened, so the improvements fixed the ""absolute garbage"" side of things. It's still fundamentally broken due to lack of E2EE (which has been the norm for private instant messaging since 2004 when OTR was introduced).

>So I judge telegram by it's actions in the past.

Then look at the protocol primitives they started with. Look at the ignorance towards E2EE by design from start. Also, there's no way to prove the servers can't be hacked just by looking at have they been hacked in the past. If everyone did that, it would incentivize Telegram to not any disclose hacks.

>\- Governments like Russia and Iran have actively tried to block Telegram access for their citizens.

Russia hacked it's way to access to at least 425 of the US Fortune500 companies in just the Solar Winds case. Why wouldn't they hack Telegram too. And no the ""distributed encryption keys across jurisdictions"" doesn't prevent that. When you hack the server, you have also access to the copy of the entire encryption key on the servers' RAM, not just the at-rest copy that's split into shares and kept safe in multiple countries.

>They wouldn't have done that if Telegram handed out data to them or if it had backdoors.

They would want to do that however, if they knew they could hack the server. Then implying ""we can't access it"" by trying to block it is just a first-degree feint.

\- Telegram isn't a corporation that benefits from exploiting personal data,

Telegram is a Limited Liability Company that reserves the right to change its business model when it's time to slaughter the piglet. Telegram can be sold when it's value is at the highest, or when Durov runs out of money and files for bankruptcy. All of that is perfectly legal. In comparison, Signal is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit which can't legally be sold.

Durov knows this, why didn't he make Telegram a non-profit from start?

>The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in  the same place as the data they protect.

This is absolute bullshit from the perspective of Computer Organization 101. You should be absolutely scared Telegram developers don't understand matters as simple as this. They entire key is in the RAM of the country in every country Telegram's servers operate in. Arguing ""we can't add ""print(server\_private\_key)"" to backend code and reboot the server to make changes take effect"" doesn't hold water, refusal to do so would be considered contempt of court.

>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.

Have they also had 0 bytes of user data hacked from servers? Are they sure they've even noticed? Considering they don't understand enough about cryptography to just implement always-E2EE protocol, why should we trust them to be skilled enough to notice NSA, SVR, CCA, Unit8200 hacking their server and establish persistence with a rootkit?

>groups limit, files transfer, dark mode, stickers

Signal has none of those issues in practice. Even at 1001 members, the group chat looks like twitch stream of spam. Dark mode, stickers, it's all there. >when it comes to user experience

Worth mentioning that Telegram allows 3rd party apps too Thank you so much, finally a well explained comment about privacy and security within telegram! Exactly what I think about it. > by using e2e we sacrifice features like using Telegram in multiple devices

I do e2ee videoconferencing from three different devices (mobile, desktop, laptop)
https://signal.org/download/#

only 1 mobile phone is allowed though yeah I have Signal on three devices ATM and I receive messages and can do voice and videoconferencing from and to any of them

https://signal.org/download/# > Period. 

yeah. It was my sad realisation at the beginning of the year. I keep telegram for the bots [deleted] I want to make it clear that I'm not a cryptographer (i.e. I'm not a post-doc researcher with peer-reviewed publications on cryptography, nor am I member of IACR). However, I've studied cryptography for about 10 years. I read papers, I develop cryptographic protocols, I participate e.g. on /r/crypto, I read what actual cryptographers say about Telegram and cryptography that touches on secure messaging as a subfield, and most importantly, I build my arguments on factual evidence, statistics, and on what cryptography allows one to do, and on what cryptography is not able to magically do. You're right. I think the correct answer is if you're really very serious about your privacy go for signal. Tho signal ends up having its own flaws in the accessibility and feature department. I think it's something that they can work on in future updates.

I don't know about telegram, but I think they too can at this point follow signals footsteps and start making some changes I should use Signal more, hope more people join the app these days Any second Android phones or tablets? Done. Thanks for letting me know. :D >Tho signal ends up having its own flaws in the accessibility and feature department.

I totally agree there's disparities in what you can do with the app. But I don't consider insecure way of doing something a feature, but the skin of a Trojan Horse (""Appears to do useful thing but is actually harmful"").

When Signal puts out a feature it's secure and private from the get-go, which in my eyes makes it a an actual feature. The reason there's disparities is this is a lot harder, so in my eyes Telegram is either taking the easy way out, or they're trying to ""move fast and break things"" to get the networking effects going: After all, average users won't assess the security on tech level (but are still outraged when a hack happens).

I hope Telegram will fix its security issues but I'm skeptical about whether they ever will, given that it requires them to write the protocol from scratch. I know that because I'm working on another communications system (one that's even more secure than Signal or even Briar). So I feel they've painted themselves in the corner and can only mitigate with damage control, but that's for their benefit, not for the benefit of their users.

The threat of getting hacked is real, and people don't really thing about the insane ramifications that has. If you want to understand what it's like consider the absolute mayhem here in Finland when the Vastaamo psychotherapy center was hacked [https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/hacked\_therapy\_centre\_emailed\_clients\_id\_numbers\_on\_invoices/11618590](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/hacked_therapy_centre_emailed_clients_id_numbers_on_invoices/11618590)

People's most intimate conversations with their therapists were leaked. That's the same stuff you discuss with your closest friends. These peoples' lives are ruined, the hacker is extorting money from them, threatening to publish their conversations.

Now imagine that but instead of 25,000 confirmed victims, consider 400 million Telegram users. You can't because humans aren't able to grasp numbers that massive. no, but I've heard it's impossible to use a second Android tablet. Whereas the iPad has its own store so you can have Signal on the phone and an iPad.

If I had a GrapheneOS pixel phone, I would download the PKG... And I cannot find it anywhere anymorw

A ridiculous oversight and will probably be enough for me to not use it going forward, which is a massive shame as it has pretty much every single other feature you would want in a messaging app Once the link to the profile is removed, it is not different from a screenshot or a copy-paste. What's your concern? How is it a huge privacy issue? ye and even if you delete the message on both sides - forwarded keeps being here - not right i guess Just forward it to a bot like @anonymousforwardsbot first well, why do i care? am i really going to forward a picture from wetasspossum69 to my family group chat? and with media, you can save and reupload, or share it back to TG from the external share menu. i don't see why you _wouldn’t_ want to be transparent about who originally sent the message. 1. Create a channel
2. Post your message in the channel first. Or forward a message in the channel first.
3. Forward the message from the channel to others. The sign-off on the message will be the channel name. (Though Telegram gives you the option of adding signatures of channel admins also). I also cant use this app or recommend it to any friends of family until this is privacy issue is resolved.

Rather than just vending I would like to offer two possible solutions..

&#x200B;

**1. Hide sender**

By default in the ""Forward Messages"" section all sender names to be hidden

&#x200B;

2. **Disable message forwarding for individual user**

If a user tries to forward a message that came from a user with this security turned ON they will get a popup/warning that the sender does not allow message forwarding.

&#x200B;

Or even better.. give both options I hate it too Thanks for all your thoughts so far. Good to get other users views.

Like others that posted I too am careful about what I type in private/ group chats however I know there are times I may write things that if taken out of context it could be reflected badly on me.

Once I send this I have zero control on how its forwarded, normally not a big deal except it has my name linked to it.

I seriously think this needs to be fixed.

I know I have the option just not to use the app but I feel this would benefit a wider audience. so like.... just don’t use that feature....? Hi, Thanks for jumping in, much appreciated.

You are correct, People can screenshot and send it on, I accept this.

Maybe if someone screenshots your messages we should get a notification, but lets leave that for another post.

If they copy/ paste this is normally fine as the original source will be removed by doing this.

I do believe it's a privacy issue as there is potential for messages to be sent around the app tagged by me but without my approval. i use secret chats with someone who i don't trust Thank you for mentioning this.

I tried this workaround and it does work, a messy workaround but it does get around the issue.

Having this option surly highlights that others are having the same issue.

&#x200B;

For new users (just like me) what this means...

* Send your chosen message (free text, copy or forward) to said bot.
* Bot will automatically reply with same text (with the bot as the source)
* Freely forward on the bots reply to whoever.
* Recipients will get message from you but will show the bot as the source. You are in control of what YOU forward to others and that is not the concern.

The concern is that messages you send to OTHERS can be then forwarded with a link back your account.

In your lovely example above if you forward "" wetasspossum69 "" onto your friend and then they forward it onto another person / group (eg your family group) your name will be linked as the creator, all outside your control or approval.

&#x200B;

I get your point on transparency but can you say that every message you ever sent would be ok to be shared (with your name)? It wouldn't be the case for me anyway Not for me to use, but others forwarding my messages and from here my name is attached to it... not sure how that respects privacy ... could change my name to something random or anonymous but that's what all of my contacts see so is not a workaround either. 
Really surprised this made it to q final product The thing is, if the link to the profile is removed, ""forwarded from robertdempsey83"" is no different from that person manually writing ""robertdempsey83 wrote: ..."", which in turn is no different than screenshotting the conversation. Why are you treating ""forwarded from"" as if it was different? You can always screenshot something if it‘s about proving something negative that someone said, so there‘s no additional risk there.

I think in combination with the fact that you can delete everything you ever posted for all people who are in the same chat, it‘s actually a great balance between having control & be held accountable for what you say. If you decide to leave something dicey up, you have to be aware that it may be publicly viewed in the future.

What I would like to see is a notification when somebody shares a message of yours, that is kinda lacking for me. i mean, i’m somewhat conscious of what i put out on the internet. i add a /s to every sarcastic message i make, so someone can’t take something out of context. i’m not a 14 year old on 4chan anymore, i don’t make racist jokes all day every day, so i don’t worry about that. 

and if someone wants to forward, say, my messages when i was partners with my ex, i mean i wouldn’t want someone to see something so personal but i dont really care if its connected to me.  what are you saying that is so controversial that it can be taken out of context? 

a tip to avoid stuff like that (like if you’re in an argument) is to send all your sentences in one message. so if someone wants to forward it, then they’ll need to forward some of the context as well. >if you forward "" wetasspossum69 "" onto your friend and then they forward it onto another person / group (eg your family group) your name will be linked as the creator, all outside your control or approval.

No, only the OP (wetasspossum69) will be linked in this case fair enough. personally, i dont say anything super offensive and i try to minimize the amount of stuff that can be taken out of context. and the people i talk with, i feel i can trust. if i dont, i simply dont initiate/maintain contact. secret chats are for a reason Yes, that would be true. Anyone could do that.

The issue is that when it leaves your circle of friends and passed around to others that you may not know you loose control and yet your name is still associated with the message by default

I truly find it astonishing that nobody else has these concerns If someone says I said that, I can just say ""No, I didn't say that"" and it becomes a ""He said, she said"" situation... Just as much as I can say you said something without you truly saying it, but I don't have your message to forward it and prove it right. You can also say screenshots were edited or forged in some way.  


That's not the same with a forwarded message which has your username, which once I click/touch, will lead me directly to your profile.  


I have no problems with the forwarding saying my name at all personally, I never saw any problems with it, and I usually find it pretty useful because I want to forward entire conversations and I want the other person to know who said what... But they are not the same thing. Good idea on the notification, you should request this feature. Id give it a like for you if you have a link to share.

&#x200B;

If a friend forwards your message and you delete the message for both your friend and yourself you still have zero control on the message out in the wild. Again I've no issues with the message its just that it has been tagged with my name and is now with someone that I did not intend to have it. The OP will be linked, correct.
But if you are the OP your name will carry forward and once outside your circle of friends you no longer have visibility or control. >The issue is that when it leaves your circle of friends and passed around to others that you may not know you loose control and yet your name is still associated with the message by default

Same as copy-pasted and screenshotted messages. You may have a problem with that and it's completely fair, but it's a problem inherent to written long distance communication, not exclusive to forwarded messages (if of course the link to the account is removed). just fucking use secret chats if you have trust issues >That's not the same with a forwarded message which has your username, which once I click/touch, will lead me directly to your profile. 

I specified multiple times my reasoning applies if you make it so forwarded messages don't link to your profile. It's a setting you can change in the privacy options. Detecting a screenshot on pc is not reliably possible. I believe they don‘t really have one feature request channel, and a minor feature like this wouldn‘t get much traction.

I‘m also unsure about the philosophy behind all that. Generally privacy online should be on the same level as in reality. So deleting your message is already kind of an interesting concept. Maybe chat histories shouldn‘t exist at all so you can‘t take anything out of context, just like a conversation. But then again, harassment would be an even bigger problem if you combine it with anonymity."

Multiple accounts and chat, can you please clarify a few doubts?;0;ksp6ym;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ksp6ym/multiple_accounts_and_chat_can_you_please_clarify/;5;Let's say I have multiple accounts and 2 different numbers and I text someone using number X, if I switch to my second number will the chats disappear? Basically this person deleted our chat and then I noticed he had changed his number..I'm wondering whether he's using multiple accounts, he created another account with another number keeping the same username or what..;2021-01-08 02:01:31;"Let me see if I understand the situation that led you to ask this question:

* A person, with whom you associate with a phone number [A] have deleted the chat for both of you. 

* That person has since messaged you again, and now his profile shows a different number [B]. 

If this is the case, your friend has simply updated their account setting to this new number. This would have nothing to do with multiple accounts. Nope he texted me using number A, then he supposedly deleted our chat because I can't see it anymore. I searched him by username and I could still see his profile and noticed that he had a different number.
I was wondering whether I don't see our chat because he has actually deleted it or because he changed his number, has a new profile and the old (associated with number A) has been automatically destroyed
I hope I was clear Uh... But this is exactly same as what I typed up there.

Anyway, yes it is possible for you to delete entire chats from the other person, and that is what your friend probably did. His having a new number is just a feature supported on Telegram. There is no account deletion involved - you just update your profile with a new number But if I search him by username and I can still see him I haven't been blocked right? Okay, let's clear up some things here. 

1. Deleting chat means only that - you delete your entire chat history with that person, but nothing else is affected. You also have an option to delete it just for you, or for both of you - your friend must have chosen the latter.  
2. Deleting a contact means you remove that person from your contact list. You are now strangers as far as Telegram is concerned. 
3. Blocking  a person means you have actively flagged a user to be prevented from interacting with you. (no messages, can't see your last visit time, etc). This does NOT remove the person from your contacts if they were there already. 

ALL that's happened is that

* Your friend deleted your chat history. 
* Your friend updated their phone number information from their profile. 

This means that for you:

* Your chat history with your friend will be gone
* Your friend will still appear in your contacts. 
* Your firend will have the same user name
* Your friend will have a different phone number.

This does NOT mean that:

* Your friend has a new telegram account
* Your friend has been removed from your contact list
* You have been removed from your friend's contact list

Looks like that's exactly what's happened to you."

* I love the secret mode but are message encrypted?
* who own Telegram and where are they based? I see a lot of talk of them being controlled by Russian govt. is that true?
* what’s the vision of Telegram?

Additional questions 

* How big is the development team for Telegram? Do they share product roadmaps ?
* Are messages decrypted by default? 
* Are group chats decrypted? 

I actually think telegram is more refined the more time I use it.";2021-01-07 22:32:53;"Not able to answer the 1st one as I didn't quite understood, but I'll answer the others

2-secret chats are 100% end to end encrypted (unlike regular chats which use server side encryption)

3-Telegram is owned by Pavel Durov and development seems to currently be based in Dubai, it being controlled by the Russian government isn't true as Russia themselves tried to ban Telegram after Durov not agreeing in weakening its security, safe to say the ban failed miserably (their attempts caused several Russian websites to go down) and it was eventually lifted

4-the vision of Telegram is to offer users access to a platform where people are free to express themselves without the fear of censorship or surveillance, while also offering as many features to make the chatting experience enjoyable and productive Question 1: Settings -> Edit (top right corner) -> tap on profile picture -> swipe and delete the unwanted ones.
The most questions are being answered on their website perfectly btw. I thought it's only me thinking about deleting whatsapp because of this new terms stuff and also i was sick of whatsapp backup. But seems like I'm not only one thinking in this way - I didn’t understand :(
- Messages are always encrypted. Secret chats have an extra layer of security (end to end encrypted), but messages in regular chats are always encrypted. (Search for Telegram FAQs).
- Telegram was founded by Pavel Durov (feel free to read about him), a Russian millionaire. 
Telegram (tg) was founded in Russian but it has NO any server, any office there. They’re currently based on Dubai. They were first in London and another countries but they moved when local regulations changed and wanted to have power over Telegram, they will also move if Dubai government wants to get some kind of accesses to Telegram user’s data. 
Telegram was banned in Russian because they didn’t cooperate with government to deliver them encryption keys and have some kind of control (that says a lot about Telegram principles). For the first one, I think what you mean is that if you put a new photo as your profile pic, the last one is still in your profile. You can go back and delete them by tapping the three dots and choosing Delete. >Are messages decrypted by default?

>Are group chats decrypted?

The regular (non-secret) chat and group chats use server side encryption, meaning in theory someone at telegram could decrypt the chat. The secret chats do both client side and server side encryption but it will not sync across devices (because the client encrypted it, which makes it unreadable outside of the two devices communicating) 

https://telegram.org/faq#q-so-how-do-you-encrypt-data

FWIW if you are doing activities that need more secure encryption use secret chat. Although doing such activities on a mobile device regardless of the chat platform, is likely insecure and ill advised. >It seems I can have a gallery of images as my display picture. That’s cool but how do I turn that off?

Simply by not setting more than one picture as profile picture. If you want to change your profile picture and don't want the old one to still be visible, simply delete it. I am disappointed by the number of people who don't know how to delete pfp but here is your answer

Settings -> Tap on your pfp -> Swipe left-right to navigate between pfps and delete unwanted by tapping on top-right three dots button.
Same process for Telegram desktop.

I have made many non-irl best friends on telegram. Joined telegram groups. I am mostly active in Anime-related telegram groups. I use telegram 4-5 hours a day. It's not just a simple messaging app but you will learn soon. I love telegram.

Secret chats messages are end-to-end encrypted and are stored on your device(not on their servers). All your other messages are stored on their servers and only you can access them with your account. So, you should be able to respond to those question about the competition, I mean Whatsapp, otherwise, you wouldn't be using, right?

PS: you can find the answers to all of your question at [telegram.org/faq](https://telegram.org/faq) Hi! I want to remind for everybody here bout an important moment: cloud storage! In telegram (in Russia, we call it ""telega"") you can use UNLIMITED cloud storage for saving some kind of stuff (from video to epub books, for example) in channels. Yesterday I deleted my Whatsapp account after 10 years of using it. I don't agree to selling my data to Facebook companies. 

Yea, I lose out on chatting in several groups I have been part of but look at the larger scheme of things here which is Facebook forcing you to accept and share data or else..... Is there anyway to turn off read receipts (or those ticks) on iOS? Seems like all questions have already been well answered. Welcome to Telegram! Do not use Telegram. Use Signal instead. Telegram has been criticized by security experts for not offering default E2EE and using a homegrown encryption protocol that is not as reviewed and endorsed as Signal protocol. The majority of these answers you have so graciously supplied to our new telegram friend could’ve been found by reading the telegram faq’s

Edit: grammar. Remember kids, don’t reply while half asleep. Yes. What I receive was a threat from WhatsApp.so I respond by moving. Tbf I’ve never been a fan Facebook either so I’m happy to move away. Putler *tried* to ban Telegram in Russia but failed miserably. Yes every user has a ""saved messages"" section where you can write something to yourself, and upload files. If you do this on your phone it will be accessible on your desktop. I think it's the best way to move files and images between desktop and mobile. Thanks. The community here is strong which obviously a good sign and everyone has been welcoming. Please source Yeah, sure, but still answered anyway cause why not That’s the “tldr” philosophy. Welcome to Reddit. Yea. What i like about telegram is it's cloud based. Saved messages section. Easy to use on desktop. The way its last seen works. Message scheduleling. Folders. Love telegram so much. Whatsapp has always been a headache for me. And i was only using whatsapp because of the groups I have in my whatsapp. But now I don't mind anything, I'm not gonna accept these rules. Time to say goodbye to Whatsapp. Correct, thank u. i mean, you can use not only ""saved messages"" as cloud storage. You can create a private channel and upload some stuff into it. I got a private channel (where only I am and nobody can join) with some music. You can use this hint for video and something else Community here indeed. Hopefully you won’t stumble accross some weird groups (which there can be many) in Telegram itself either. Have fun!

If my friends really want to chat or if I want to chat then I’ll call them and when things are good we will meet face to face Oh that's a great idea! Yeah I’m still try to wrap my head around that.

You probably mean only one mobile phone. So many people on Telegram complaining about this, that this is what you must mean https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007320451-Troubleshooting-multiple-devices hmm that clown just became the richest man on earth.  how was *your* day? Why do you want Elon Musk to be fornicated? the joke is that elon supports coups in bolivia because that’s where he gets lithium for his batteries Man, this sucks most. Just bring e2e and enable God messenger I much prefer Telegram's approach: use e2e only when I want to. It's more important that I have all chat history with friends **readily available on all my devices**.

Even when I need to send files I don't want Telegram server to see, I'll encrypt them myself before sending them instead of using e2e. Yes Signal requires your phone number to sign up.

And I agree with you, their official app was not very attractive, I have asked some of my friends to sign up account, then after awhile none of us really use it. Yeah, I meant multiple Android devices, thanks for the clarification. It has probably been better than Elon's since I'm not subjected to the stress of managing multibillion dollars companies and I'm not costantly seekeing validation from edgy teens on twitter just for marketing purposes and to build a fake hyp online persona. Also I honestly sleep well knowing I'm not related to coups and union busting. I'm quite happy I'm not leaving the ""dream"" of being a billionare in America, but people are free to continue to suck the boot of their favourite ""he's just like me!"" imaginary friendo Well I went to sleep with a clear conscience knowing that I haven't supported any coups in my life, so I'd say pretty good!

""Signal, the recommended app for organizing coups in democratically elected south american countries so you can get cheaper lithium"" - some dude in this comment section

He literally tweeted “We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it.” to an accusation that the U.S. government organized a coup against President Evo Morales, so that he could obtain Bolivia’s lithium. This is not some Haha funny meme guy joke, ok? This should be taken seriously. Exploiting 3rd world countries for minerals and resources should not be the topic of any joke coming from a capitalist. All I'm saying is: Play gulag games, win gulag prices.
He gained 142 BILLION $ in 2020. That's an insane amount of money considering there's a pandemic. Speaking of the pandemic - he did an extremely bad job at handling the pandemic, refusing multiple times to close his factories and denying the capabilities of the virus all the way leading up to the ""FREE AMERICA"" - tweet in response to the lockdown orders. This is a beautiful illustration on his COVID response:

If you seriously believe that the second wealthiest person on earth is a nice person... Idk take a look at your latest paychecks - assuming you didn't loose your job bc of the pandemic. The wealth inequality today is much larger than right before the french revolution. If you don't recognize that - then you'll be oppressed and exploited for ever.

The only reason you may like him is bc he inspires you. And that's fair - his life is pretty awesome - and yours isn't. But you have to recognize that these things are connected. He contributed nothing to science. He contributed nothing to the engineering community. He isn't the one researching, planing or building EVs, rockets or tunnels. He is not the ""productivity guru"" like he is portrait as in some YT videos. He is just the dude who already inherited tones of money from his dad and bought some companies.
And despite his history he chooses ever single day that he is entitled to a portion of sb else's labor, Lithium in other countries, oppose medical professionals, take sbs life, overthrow democraticly elected governments and then spend the rest of the day on twitter sharing memes. If Signal can‘t do multi device (don‘t know about that, just trusting one of the comments above) & Telegram isn‘t implementing it in their system, there have to be some technical difficulties to this solution. AFAIK Apple is the only provider of multi device e2ee with iMessage, and the sync between devices is wayy slower compared to Telegram. Yes this saved my ass a lot of times, can't deny that. Objectively one of the coolest things about Telegram and what allowed me to move many chats away off whatsapp >He contributed nothing to science. He contributed nothing to the  engineering community.

I know that it is not the right sub for discussing this but......finally someone had the guts to say that loud! It is quite astonishing the fact that the majority of the geeks community is still convinced that he actually contributes very much to the products he launches (it's just like saying that Bill Gates coded by himself every single line of every Windows version......seriously?). I mean, the concept ideas are actually good. But he's not in the world who he claims to be. He just puts the money and nothing else. Everything else is handled by engineers, physicists, neuroscientists etc. And yet he expects people to believe that he actually led the projects for the whole development phase. He's just a guy with a lot of money that really likes twitter. I think [Wire](https://wire.com/en/) also allows user to use e2e with multiple devices. >It is quite astonishing the fact that the majority of the geeks community is still convinced that he actually contributes very much to the products he launches.....He just puts the money and nothing else.


[Because we are much better informed than you are.](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacexlounge/comments/k1e0ta) While not arguing your points about him not directly contributing like doing his own research or development... There is something to be said about a man who chooses to dedicate that level of resources to a field that previously nobody really did in a private sector. For example, I think that if it wasn't for Tesla, we'd still be years behind on the electric cars.

I am not really a fan of Elon or his companies.. But my own feelings about him aside, I wouldn't go so far as to say he contributed nothing to science. That's like saying people who only donate money to charity contributes nothing to the cause. Truuu Fair statement. Thanks for the reply.

Maybe I didn't explain myself in a clear way, but what I meant to say is exactly what you wrote. His companies (especially spacex) have contributed a lot to science. But that's thanks to the tremendous amount of effort made by all the people behind these companies (engineers, scientists, etc.) that actually contributed to the cause."
Screenshots and secret chats!;1;kshdeu;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kshdeu/screenshots_and_secret_chats/;4;[removed];2021-01-07 19:58:05;"iOS doesn't allow apps to alter system-wide behavior like taking a screenshot. So Telegram can't prevent a user from taking one - so it can only send a notification to the other person.  

Android, on the other hand, allows for such functions - which is why it will deny the screenshot altogether.

FYI: I am told that this feature is not 100% foolproof, as some system versions or configuration can potentially get by this system. I have android, if I try to screenshot a secret chat and the other person has IOS will he get notified? And what if we both have Android? According to [this tweet from Telegram](https://mobile.twitter.com/telegram/status/1189546770923167746), the notification gets sent for merely attempting a screenshot. So in all cases, the other person would get notified. Uhm, I just tried with a friend, she hasn't been notified and I have Android. However, she's using IOS and I got the notification when she took the screenshot"
Massive russian looking spam accounts join my group.

The one other solution besides no username kicking, us to change the group name, or set it to private, but not a fan of those personally Report them to Telegram support I use shieldy seems to work so far Make your group invite only. [deleted] I use combot for this. It works so far. first I used the antispam settings. but the spambots did nothing for days or weeks. then mostly a spam post came and was deleted from the combot. but now I have switched to the captcha. the accounts are then deleted after 1 minute if you do not press the button. so far no one has pressed the button.

Telegram can oversee all things that happen in the cloud chats or anyone having access to the encryption key !?;3;ks4e57;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ks4e57/telegram_can_oversee_all_things_that_happen_in/;18;"What! Do all platforms have their respective encryption keys?     
If they, then every messaging app is not secure ?     
And why do they even access it for any reason ?";2021-01-07 06:19:01;"Technically can because they have access to the encryption keys as Durov stated in one of his article titled why Telegram cloud chats are not end to end encrypted. If it’s stored on a company’s servers their required by law to have the keys. iCloud is the same way. To keep completely encrypted from everybody you need to keep things on device. Once it’s on Apple servers other normal people can’t see it but if required by law enforcement agencies they have the keys to get the data. According to this FAQ [https://telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-process-data-requests](https://telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-process-data-requests) the chats by default are not end-to-end encrypted, but the decryption key is split and distributed to many servers on different countries, and thus multiple countries have to request access at once to retrieve chat content. This may show that even Telegram can't just assemble the keys by request of one country... but I'm not sure about the internal of Telegram itself That seems a -ve for telegram , so there is no way of end-to-end encryption (except secret chats) for everything thats on cloud ? Thankyou , & When will they use the encryption key and watch over our data? Any situation that takes place!? If any. >If it’s stored on a company’s servers their required by law to have the keys.

What? No. You're telling me nobody can ever upload self-encrypted content to a corporation's server? Actually, it is country by country. E.g, EU as such in its Directive(s) does not require general access to the data in rest, rather opposite, insisting they must be deleted immediately after the transmission to the end user device. It does not matter how many people and whom to hold a general key. Once there is such option, it is time to move on for those, who are looking for an ultimate privacy. As you suggested, keeping data just on devices.   


NOTE: I am talking data, not metadata. No. But relatively, it's better than WhatsApp. And only Durov and an AI bot have access to the key I mean all you really have to ever go off of is a company’s word. Apple says they don’t ever actively look at that stuff. And based on their track record with user privacy until they caught you’re two choices are “believe them” or “err on the side of caution” and don’t keep anything in the cloud. In the https://telegram.org/faq titled 'how do we process data requests' it is mentioned that the keys are split up in multiple parts and only when all the governments ask for the keys together then they can be released. Let's say the indian govt wants my chats, it might be possible that my keys aren't even under indian jurisdiction That statement may have been wrong. My point was iCloud, google cloud etc, they have the keys for anything encrypted. Besides new privacy policy of whatsapp , it has end-to-end encryption right.!? Yes, telegram is way better in all other aspects .. but now I feel something is lagging on Telegram (privacy) 

Where can I get additional information regarding this issue? Haha.. seems tough choices need to be made.
But That seems a -ve for telegram , so there is no way of end-to-end encryption (except secret chats) for everything thats on cloud ? Whatsapp is closed source and the binaries are obfuscated. So no one except developers know if it has backdoor or if it correctly implements e2ee signal protocol.

Moreover, whatsapp backup are stored on third party cloud in plain text [link](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/136072/how-can-whatsapp-restore-local-or-google-drive-backups?rq=1). You have to trust both whatsapp (facebook) and goole/apple.

Telegram is open source on client side with reproducible builds. Moreover, it uses an open protocol and the backup is in its own distributed infrastructure. So you have to trust only telegram. According to its [privacy policy](https://telegram.org/privacy) and [terms of service](https://telegram.org/tos) it is a good service for user privacy.

You can read here about a good comparison between them telegra dot ph /What-are-the-features-of-a-secure-and-private-communication-service-07-10 (reddit blocks it). That seems to be the verdict. Secret chats doesn’t put it on their servers if I’m correct. Does all other cloud platform has same encryption levels ? Signal is good with default encryption to all chats but it lags far behind telegram when it comes to simplicity and features.


From my PoV, telegram gives you a good messaging experience. If you wanna go full blown snowden, you can use “secret chats” within telegram that packs the same encryption as Signal. Just a button away."

How can i export telegram contacts that have no phone number ... just telegram id ? it's saved like this in my phone .. i want to share it ... how can i do this ?;1;krxisd;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/sb91vte94s961.png;16;;2021-01-07 00:22:30;"Can I ask why? It doesn’t make much sense tbh If its about exporting few contacts, why not just copy the id and share it? I got that contact from the nearby people option 

And it doesn't show the phone number unless you ask the person for it.

So anyway i saved that contact from there.

And want to share it with a friend as it no longer shows up there in the nearby people. >why not just copy the id and share it?

how ? there is no option to import it back ! That wont work. Telegram servers won’t give someone’s information (even with the id) to another user unless they’ve already seen that user or the user has an username.

Not only that, but there’s no client that supports adding people to telegram using a contact that has the user id as phone number You have two ways of sharing that person contact:

- Give your friend their username
- Forward a message from that user and hope he hasn’t his privacy settings set to hide his account from forwarded messages >Give your friend their username

I can't find that.

>Forward a message from that user and hope he hasn’t his privacy settings set to hide his account from forwarded messages

About that ...i don't want to send them a message.


And about the i can't share a contact using the Telegram id ... why ? While that id number is unique . If when you open that user’s profile you don’t see an username then they don’t have one.

Regarding the id, yes, they are unique but for privacy reasons the user that is trying to use that id must have seen it somewhere on telegram. >that is trying to use that id must have seen it somewhere on telegram.

what the heck .. it's on my phone , what if i changed the phone then i loss access to these contacts ?! that's dump as F.  


> they are unique but for privacy reasons 

and what are these ?  


so i should give up , right ? :| They’re not on your phone, they’re stored on telegram’s servers. 

Tbh, unless you find a way to do one of the two things I listed you before there’s no way. >They’re not on your phone, they’re stored on telegram’s servers.

hmm so why the contact is in my phone's contact manager not just the telegram account if that was the case ? 

  
according to what you say if i logged out and in another account in the same phone with these contacts saved in my phone. they will not show up , right ? 

&#x200B;

>Tbh, unless you find a way to do one of the two things I listed you before there’s no way.

&#x200B;

okay thanks a lot bro.  


> Forward a message from that user 

about that ... you mean from that user ? that gonna be harder than i thought. If you added him as a contact through the telegram app, then it is saved as contact both in telegram servers and your phone’s contact manager.

If you logged in another account and you had some contacts with their phone numbers (and contacts syncing on) saved you would see them on that account.

Forward a message from the contact you’re trying to share >their phone numbers

nope no phone numbers in our case. Then they wont sync up >Then they wont sync up

hmm what if i removed them from my account will they sync again ? (From the Phone's contacts manager?)"

I did used Telegram sometime back but then decided to delete my account (set to forget me in a month) logged out from everywhere and then deleted the app. After hearing WhatsApp thing decided to return back and set my account from scratch (settings&name&people) but somehow Telegram remembered my nickname/username. How is this possible? Considering it forgot my name and picture my account should be deleted am i wrong? I'm pretty sure about 1 month setting and it has been like half a year.";2021-01-06 17:01:12;"This is my logical guess:
When you set a nickname/username for your account, telegram checks if that username is already taken. And if it is available it will associate that username to your phone number.
Now even after the account is deleted, telegram cannot let someone else take that username as it might lead to your existing friends contacting the new person who took your username.
So telegram might be keeping just that data (your phone number and username assigned to it). You must have used the same phone number you used earlier. Hmm that makes sense, it reserves username so people can't just hijack accounts. Thanks! I did used the same number yeah. The name is linked to the number.

(Thinking about GDPR and the merger rules from 2014). And THIS, Ladies and Gentlemen, large Tech companies should NOT be allowed to take over smaller companies. 

Letting facebook buy instagram and whatsapp was one of the largest mistakes of the Western tech world. I've said it once and ill say it again. Promote the use of telegram! I've had 23+ to start using telegram. Really time the world leaves WhatsApp for Signal and Telegram. Here is all what you need to know.
http://imgur.com/gallery/69DAKOR This is just for India as pilot, but I assume it will be progressively rolled out for all other regions as well in the next Qs. Got the policy change warning screen here in Italy this morning! I have clicked ""not now"", but I don't want to lose my account. What should I do now? well, telegram does not have e2e at all, not counting secret direct chats that people hardly use in general

so telegram can be processing your message history in any way

or anyone who hacks them can

at least up until this news whatsapp was actually way more secure (not counting unencrypted backups) It's not true for everyone in the EU (sorry UK). [This](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy-eea) is the updated privacy policy for within the EU. India initially.. seems WhatsApp start most changes in India Seems like this is specific to India This was added to Mexico too, a big demographic of WhatsApp users. Did you even attempt to read the link? The agreement with the EU was ro keep the data separate for the users on these platforms. 
The problem is that Governments take too long to take action. Now the excuse will be that it will be too complicated for Facebook to roll out the merger Add Oculus, at least they have Valve around. This is very true I don’t know why they let Facebook buy them out now we face to the fact that we have to migrate away from those apps just to get away from Facebook doing their crap. IG turned into a shopping mall with so many ads, bots, it only feels like I follow 10 people and not over 500 and now WhatsApp is turning into a fishing net for personal info. It’s a damn shame how these apps doing down hill like this. For every praise of Telegram you will get a Signal promoter saying that Telegram is not E2E encrypted, it is from a Russian company and the encryption protocol is unknown. Italy got it https://reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/krnw08/_/gied5hq/?context=1

Middle East got the alert. I got it today in Bangladesh Well you only have two choices... agree, or stop using whatsapp. That means that with Telegram, there is a possibility that someone might get your data and maybe that someone uses them in a wrongful manner.

With Facebook you have a certainty that your data will definitely fall into the worst hands possible. My money is on Telegram dude it’s your decision if you don’t want to use secret chats. yes it is really convenient to have best-in-class sync of all of your devices, but you can use it just as limited as WhatsApp. > not counting unencrypted backups

Let's ignore a huge issue with WhatsApp then. At least it wouldn’t be facebook who has them > not counting secret direct chats that people hardly use in general

And voice/video calls as well, huh? That's like saying people don't have feet, not counting the two feet a person has. Jesus, man, come on. You are right. People shouldn't be downvoting you.  Telegram is better than Facebook by plenty, but lack of end to end and complete trust in a kinda sketchy company protecting your data is not ideal. Getting downvoted for saying the truth must hurt...

I mean Telegram is not even fully open sourced.
Doesn't do e2e as well as others.
Can get hacked and leak all your data.
Can sell your data since they can update TOS without informing you.

It's just WhatsApp but without e2e. Honestly Signal is just as convenient but much more secure. I got the policy change warning screen here in Moldova. but brexit ftw right? Does Switzerland count as EU or not, regarding this law ? I recommend matrix.org :) Face-palm to everyone who says that. And the encryption method better be unknown. And Colombia How can I agree now? My money's on signal. Do you hear yourself talking? ""There is a possibility"" With Signal there is no possibility. So use it. if the choice is like this - instead why not just using any third app, that does encrypt everything properly

i mean, telegram is great, but it was never a secure chat app, why comparing it with whatsapp in data security to begin with yes, it is my decision. One that i have to make if it need cross-device chat sync. And there is no ability at all to create encrypted groups.

so i would just go with something like signal, that has it all and encrypted by default, and is not limited.

all i wanted to say is that it's strange to mock whatsapp's new policy when telegram basically is only protected by telegram's promises i don't know about your experience, but in mine, as well as everyone i know using telegram, people use calls about 1-5% of time using telegram, almost never. telegram was always chasing in the voice/audio calls, not leading.

now lets add generous 5% of people using secret chats (in reality never saw as they are not synced between devices)

and we have 10% of secure usage and 90% completely opened for anyone at telegram.

what telegram is good at is big group chats and meme channels, which is basically the only thing i use it for

for any communication in smaller groups or personal - just use signal True that. Telegram is not designed for ""Privacy by Design"". You have to actively opt in to Secret Chats to get End to End Encryption. I bet most people using Telegram don't even know Secret Chats exist Of course, take back control etc.... I am not sure, but i'm afraid not. >the encryption method better be unknown

This is wrong, just fyi Uhm what? End to End Encryption is safe even though it's fully known how it works. That's the magic of it. And Israel I presume it will keep asking you until one day you won't be able to say 'not now'. I hear you, but as others are saying here, convenience vs security. When comparing Whatsapp to Telegram, whatsapp is now less secure and for me, not as convenient either.  


When compared to Signal, Telegram isn't as secure but it is miles away more convenient, for me that is Your concerns are correct, but the thing is, privacy and convenience dont go hand in hand and you may like it or not,we are a bunch of privacy nerds and the regular public is far from that, all they want is to chat and hopefully,not have some human read them(like friends/family/government for legal matters)

Telegram strikes a nice mix of convenience and privacy and hear me out, while secret chats are not convenient, they stay what they are meant to be-secret. And regarding the others,check out https://telegram.org/faq on how they handle regular ones(titled ""how do we process data requests""), the answer is pretty well explained.

And basically all of privacy relies on trusting someone with their commitment and I'd rather trust someone who has released 0 bytes of data till date(mentioned in the faq) rather than Facebook. Since Facebook doesn’t publish their source code there’s no way of knowing if they actually use e2e-encryption. so that’s also just promises.

I also previously criticized the lack of e2e-encryption in group chats and hope that that will still happen.

But if you look at it as a whole, you have Telegram with an option for secure transmission & a principled CEO who is hiding from governments to keep the data safe vs Facebook who will have secure transmission for a tracking app with added chat features. Data leakage just isn’t on the table anymore if the provider of the app is directly selling your data. > i don't know about your experience

And anyone else's, just like I don't know yours or anyone else's. Using your personal experience as evidence of anything general is anti-logical and anti-scientific. Let's not do that. And let's not use fifty different apps for fifty different purposes when one does the trick. They still could implement this themselves. They could also not implement that. Because it's under their control. South Africa too how's it more convenient when signal got a desktop app for windows + mac, stores local backups of your data etc. what do yoz miss from telegram? i use telegram basically from it's very inception, and still use it, i'm aware of pluses and minuses, yes, and i do still use it for channels and mega groups.

about all privacy relying on trusting someone - yes, indeed, but i would better trust community or audition company that checks open-sourced code for using proper cryptography, rather than a company that stores all my stuff in open text.

they indeed **claim** they never released anything to anyone, but you have no ways of checking that. And they have the ability to wake up one day and decide to sell it.

and even if they are angels - they can be hacked, and hackers will be able to see everything, and then your data will not be accessible to facebook alone, it will be basically public knowledge.

to summarise - i'm not saying telegram is a bad app, just not secure one and making fun here about whatsapp's data policy is just hypocrisy indeed you cannot prove e2ee in whatsapp, but that is beside the point.

looking as a whole: telegram has a CEO the **plays the role** of a principled person, and he is by no means hiding from anyone. whenever they get a request that they have to obey according to british laws - they will obey it.

also imagine a situation where a CEO looses a bunch of money on a risky gambit. Now he owns investors a tonn of money, and suddenly some government offers him to close his debts if only he will silently leak some info on some numbers, they promise to never announce that publicly, just a little silent data leakage.

what guarantees exactly do you have here?

again, the only point im trying to make is that you are making fun of whatsapp while telegram not more secure by any means You forgot the /s right? The UK isn't big enough to do something like this, Facebook will laugh at them. > And they have the ability to wake up one day and decide to sell it.

If they do that, everyone will stop using Telegram. It would be a pretty stupid move. > If they do that, everyone will stop using Telegram

Very misguided assumption.

WhatsApp was sold to Facebook and everyone is still flocking to it. only if you are told about it.

they can sell it without publicly announcing. a deal with some government, or any kind of data aggregator, even just for ""anonymous"" statistic purposes.

they CAN do it at any moment, no technical restriction prevents them

or someone who hacks them. Why would they? Whatsapp's users don't care. Whatsapp is a replacement for SMS. It doesn't matter if Facebook owns it.

Telegram is used by dissidents in Russia, Belorus and Hong Kong. It takes pride in being anti-establishment. But again, who would make a deal with Telegram to collect data, knowing that if the deal became public Telegram would lose all its users? It's not worth the money. That’s why, in the end, it all boils down to who you trust more.

Pavel Durov, who spent his own money to establish Telegram Messenger AD FREE and feature-rich for 7 years without asking anyone for a cent because he believes security and privacy is a right everyone should have, and also an advocate for it.

OR

Mark Dinkleberg who are controlled by Facebook Investors and profit from the selling of userdata, datamining and targeted advertising and was also grilled by the US senate for accusation of data privacy breach?

Gee golly, I wonder who I would trust with my data more? Such an extremely hard and complex decision.

/s Just a small minority. Sorry that argument not good. basically it comes down to that you choose to believe that telegram would never do that.

however i dont see anything impossible for a government, such as russian, to make such a deal. even if it works for a year or two and then somehow it leaks to public - still worth the money. they don't care if telegram loses it's users after (it won't - zealots will stay with durov's promises to ""fix everything"") - government will just go buy or hack another chat platform i will better trust something that was independently audited, and fully client/server open-sourced, so i and the whole community can check anything themselves

so i choose signal for personal and small group communications

&#x200B;

and btw: the difference between durov and zuck is just marketing how i see it Why are you in the telegram subreddit if you don't trust it enough to use it? Yeah, it's a matter of trust and tradeoffs. I thinks it's very unlikely Telegram would sell its data like that, and in the mean time, I appreciate Telegram's features. So I continue to use it.

Whatsapp sucks in comparison. It's years behind. It looks like you’ve already cemented your decision.

I’m betting everything on Durov. You can keep using signal if you like but I’ll still stand by Durov and Telegram.

Also, Telegram Messenger grew through word of mouth advertising because it’s THAT good, unlike Facebook who actually spent millions on advertising.

Signal has been around for quite a while and yet its userbase isn’t progressing well than Telegram. That alone tells a lot. I have both but I’m more active on Telegram. I use it. Example: following super group for index trade.

I do not use Telegram for personal chats. but that's the thing - i did not cement my decision. so far i do use signal for personal communication because i came to the conclusion that is the most secure user-friendly centralized chat app right now that covers all my communication needs.

if you or someone point me to something better - i will study the issue and will switch to that.

And i do use telegram as well, as i stated before, for channels and megagroups - things that has no point having e2ee. And i would blame those features specifically for telegram's success.

signal moves with tiny paces, making sure everything is secure, everything is encrypted, so the top feature they have at the moment is encrypted group calls for 5 people max. not too sexy from consumer's point of view, indeed.

so what is signal from the most general consumer's point of view - it's just another whatsapp.   
what is telegram - it is basically a social network at this point, and with ""reputation"" for being ""not like others""  
i see the appeal

i guess you can even compare it to the early years of facebook, when it either hasn't collected/processed user data yet, or noone knew/cared about it Fair enough, for supergroups it doesn't matter nearly as much. I don’t know what else to tell you except to trust Durov that he will not end up like Fuckerberg.

I have high hopes and faith that he won’t. 

Same could be said with Signal.

It’s all about where you would put your trust. 

Signal servers are based in the US IIRC, so I’m not to keen with that idea. To each his own, I suppose."

"""People Nearby"" can expose your precise location to others. Make sure it is turned off if you don't want it on.";28;krj5h6;Telegram;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/01/telegram-feature-exposes-your-precise-address-to-hackers/;30;;2021-01-06 10:39:50;"You have to turn it on and allow location access on Android. This isn't really a bug so I am not sure what they want Telegram to fix. While I agree in principle that any feature that you need to opt-in for has a level of ""Hey, you asked for it"" to it, I do have to question: who saw this feature and immediately thought it would or should be accurate to the last meter? I certainly didn't, and I have to disagree with ""this is not an issue or a bug"". I even see some people likening this to someone sharing their location with a friend, and I don't think it's the same at all.

The way I see it, there are two possible use-cases for this feature. One is that you met someone in person and you wanna quickly add /talk to that person. The other is that you, for whatever reason, wanna chat up a random person who is ""near"" where you are - sort of like what a HAM radio enthusiast might do.

In neither of these cases, do you need information like ""215m away"". At most, You just need to see relative closeness of a set of people within a given radius (which should be sufficiently large). Because in any other use-cases, you would have talked to the person already and a myriad of other options to share your location privately would have been open to you. I can't personally think of anyone benefiting from this feature being this accurate other than the stalker types. This is neither an issue nor a bug. Please read the original ""[bug reporting](https://blog.ahmed.nyc/2021/01/if-you-use-this-feature-on-telegram.html)"" with telegram security team answer and an [user reply](https://blog.ahmed.nyc/2021/01/if-you-use-this-feature-on-telegram.html?showComment=1609863689668&m=1#c134907721844259206). The only thing I don't like with this feature is how it is described, leading to some [strange things](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/f4odds/make_myself_visible_button_is_confusing/) A user does not show up in “People nearby” unless they enable the function. Doing so triggers a warning from Telegram informing you your location is about to be published and it may lead to undesired attention so it really can’t happen by accident.
I’m also using the app on iOS, the operating system asks periodically if I want to continue sharing location in the background (in case I forget to turn it off) or I can just choose to enable it while using the app (which is what I usually do). You mean the feature that you enable to tell people when you're nearby and how close you are can tell people you're nearby and how close you are? That's like saying sending a live location to your friends exposes your location to them. Of course it does, that's the point of the feature. https://i.imgur.com/wVuxvsl.jpg
This nifty feature exists in iOS now. I couldn't elaborate in the main post but I discovered this as a problem the other day when some random tried to contact me out of the blue. He backed off when he realized it was the wrong person. But it freaked me out. 

This only applies to smartphones, and apple seems to have better security with this. To check, go to the main menu, and click on ""People Nearby"". Check to see if you have red text above the list of people. If it says ""stop showing me"" in red then it's on. If it says ""make myself visible"" in blue you're not visible.

Stay safe. But it still leads to a privacy concern without people even realising it.

In the article the author says Line had the same issue and notified them about that, and they solved it by randomising the distance info a little bit - which can be done easily.

Let's be real, you won't really need to know the exact ~~location~~distance some random stranger is from you unless you're really trying to get their exact location. If it's reporting the exact distance (or otherwise allowing to triangulate the exact location) it could still be an unnecessary privacy exposure in my opinion

I'm sure there are ways that telegram could change the code so that your real position is kept hidden while anyway being able to tell that you're in a general area of 500 meters or so Well in general, it would make sense to Telegram users that it doesn’t reveal your precise location to strangers. Finding people nearby may imply to people that it finds people within a subjective radius. Sure, it could clarify further and leave less room for assumption, but at the same time, I wouldn’t be surprised if Telegram users believed it showed a rough location, for example, any people within 1km of them. I think it’s an apple to oranges comparison when you’re comparing sharing a live location to a nearby location. “Nearby” is subjective, and as aforementioned, leaves room for misinterpretation. People should be aware that their location is send to whomever if they use a location tracking feature.

They could randomize the location info a bit but that would also make the feature worse. Whether that's an acceptable trade-off... idk. It could be an option in the people nearby settings. except the method LINE used was not really effective: https://blog.ahmed.nyc/2021/01/if-you-use-this-feature-on-telegram.html?showComment=1609863689668&m=1#c134907721844259206 It cannot be solved. Even with location noise, the triangulation still works. An [user](https://blog.ahmed.nyc/2021/01/if-you-use-this-feature-on-telegram.html?showComment=1609876611667&m=1#c6381181394212509719) explained this quite well. 500 meters is 546.81 yards If you open the People Nearby menu, you can see exactly how close other people are, which gives you a metric to go by. Similarly, when you turn on the function, there's some kind of warning about being visible to other people. Plenty of precautions for a simple function tbh. People should be aware that  electricity can kill you. That doesn't make circuit breakers a bad idea. It's a safety feature that SHOULD be there, just like a certain level of location obscuring is something that SHOULD be a part of a feature like People nearby. 

There simply is no possible use cases for that feature to reveal specific, exact location (or in this case, distance). If doing something can ONLY harm its potential users, why shouldn't there be a safety buffer? I disagree with that user, we want to define requirements of the feature and a threat model

Assuming the feature is intended to facilitate local chats we want to be reasonably close, more that 1-2 kilometers minimum is not good because if you want to have a group chat at a concert or protest or something you might want it more localized

At the same time less than 200-400 meters is likely useless because there's not that much room for a lot of people, especially accounting for gps error

We also can assume that the user is willing to share their general location, so we'll assume that someone figuring out where you live within a range of half a kilometer is not a problem

However if I want to participate in a chat that has a radius of 5 kilometers I might not want people to know exactly where I live down to the street number. What if someone takes issue with something I say and decides it'd be a fun idea to come break my window or something

The comment you linked thought of adding random noise but they're still keeping the base location correct. I would suggest changing the location you report to the telegram servers themselves, so if I'm at a certain location my phone gives the telegram servers a different, close but still reasonably inexact, location. On top of this fake location telegram can then add fuzzying, not showing anything with more resolution than 300 meters

A simple enough implementation would be to base the location reported on something like [plus codes](https://maps.google.com/pluscodes/), of course not at the maximum resolution but the phone would, when changing square choose randomly a neighboring (or once removed neighbor) square and report that as its location to telegram, telegram would then apply fuzzying to a random location in the square, possibly making the address overflow into other squares

The phone would also be able to keep a record of the location it reported for each square, so that it'd always report that one, this way an attacker can't triangulate based on prolonged observation of a target

This of course doesn't help if you live in the middle of nowhere and you're the only house in the range of hundreds of meters, but for most people this would be good enough, some further tweaking would be to pick only ghost squares actual

Of course it will leak some information, but right now it leaks significantly more information than it looks to an inexpert user (many people don't know triangulation is actually a thing)

Edit, I realized, embarrassingly enough that I didn't explicitly state my threat model, but I'm looking to ""defend"" against people gathering enough data to pinpoint an house in a reasonably crowded neighborhood even with prolonged collection of the data (stalkers are the main concern imo) I never said I wasn't against it, I even had a design idea.

It's quite the stretch to say that this ONLY can harm users. It obviously makes the feature more accurate.

Even if you randomize the distance a bit you can still find out where somebody lives or works. If you spend enough time you can get the same accuracy as before, you just need more time. I do not agree. However, please feel free to answer to that user. I think he will be answer you. I mean... People nearby is a feature designed exclusively for discoverability between people who don't know each other (or at least those who have had no direct contact over telegram). What possible use case exists where accuracy of this level, in a feature like this, is a good thing?

And the fact that it's not a foolproof solution is only a reason for continuing to find better solution. Doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. Wearing a helmet while skydiving probably does VERY little to save you if something goes wrong; but you should still do it in case that's the thing that ends up saving you. In this case, that added time required could be the difference between some random creep finding out where you live, and that creep deciding that it's not worth the effort. >What possible use case exists where accuracy of this level, in a feature like this, is a good thing? 

That you want to find people close to you. I don't get the question, sorry. If you move the range from lets say 1km to 900m the next logical question is why not 800m. If you randomize the distance then people that are ""near"" you will sometimes be near you and sometimes not. That makes the feature arguably worse. And it will not increase security since you can use statistical methods to average the persons positions, you just need more data points.

>In this case, that added time required could be the difference between some random creep finding out where you live, and that creep deciding that it's not worth the effort.

If somebody is crazy enough to physically change their position to triangulate you then it doesn't matter whether they have to wait for one hour or one day.

If you were a stalker would you say to yourself: Ah nah, I would move around a few times a day to find her, but I wouldn't do it for three days in a row? That's (unfortunately) not how obsession works. [As I said here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/krj5h6/people_nearby_can_expose_your_precise_location_to/giak7yv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I only see two possible use cases for this feature.

1. you met someone in person and you wanna quickly add /talk  to that person on Telegram without having to look up user ID or exchange phone numbers.
2. You wanna chat with a random person in a close proximity. Sort of like what a HAM  radio enthusiast might do.

In 1, the information only needs to be accurate enough to determine the nearest person. AND you would have that person with you, so slight inaccuracy wouldn't matter. Any mistake can easily be corrected on the spot.For 2, it's a COMPLETE non-issue, as you are not looking for one specific person. If you liked the person you chanced upon, you would find that person again from your list of chats, not from going back to ""people nearby""

While I think randomized location is not THE answer, or even a really good one by itself, it absolutely doesn't affect the only two possible use cases that I can think of.

Meanwhile, your hypothetical stalker is someone THAT obsessed with finding you that they would go through the trouble of triangulating your location with randomized distance information. You think someone like that exists, and your solution is to NOT obscure your location? For what possible benefit? What kind of logic is this?

Simple fact of the matter is this: accurate distance information in a feature designed ONLY to be used between strangers can ONLY be harmful for the user with little to no added benefit. Obscuring this information in literally ANY way is absolutely better than not doing it. I personally think a MUCH more likely scenario is someone saw a profile pic that they liked and they wanna see if you can try to hook up with that person. And for those kind of ""casual creeps"" I think even a randomized distance information is a deterrent enough for majority of them.

Finally, just to throw it out there - I think a better system would be to randomize your location some, but also  to only show distance in intervals no smaller than, say 3-5 km.  If multiple users fall within that interval, it should simply be sorted according to distance without revealing that distance. For instance : Let's say a person A is 10m away from you, and B is 4.6 km away from you. Let's consider another situation where person A is 1.6km away from you, while B is 1.7km away.  In both cases, you should only see

* \[A\] less than 5km
* \[B\] less than 5km

Again, I'm not saying a determined individual COULDN'T or even WOULDN'T try to find you - I'm just saying that it would be infinitely more difficult for them. Refer to my earlier examples of safety for further examples to illustrate that point. >Meanwhile, your hypothetical stalker is someone THAT obsessed with finding you that they would go through the trouble of triangulating your location with randomized distance information. You think someone like that exists, and your solution is to NOT obscure your location? For what possible benefit? What kind of logic is this?

If somebody is that obsessed that they would triangulate you why would they not sit there for a few hours more? If you don't randomize they have to: Gather their equipment and move around and wait in a few spots to gather data. If the distance is randomized they need to do the exact same, just wait a bit longer. If you are desperate enough to triangulate somebody you won't think that waiting longer is a problem.

Obscuring this information (security through obscurity) makes the feature worse because now it isn't reliable anymore in who is in your area. Again, whether that trade off is worth it should be up to the user, but my point is that it is objectively worse for the feature.

I am not against changing this feature (I don't even use it), I am against band aid solutions that make you think you are safe when you aren't. You say that it would be objectively worse for the feature, but look at what the feature IS. Its literal function is to show you someone ""close"" to you. NOT to measure exact distance between two or more individuals. Unless you are COMPLETELY randomizing your location, how does it hurt what this function is? ESPECIALLY if you consider the solution that I propose?

Furthermore, what is a real life use case where someone would want to let a complete stranger know EXACTLY how far they are from you? (or visa versa?) Are you the world's most generous target  of the world's luckiest sniper? What possible benefit is there?

I WILL concede that for the most DEDICATED obsessive individual, this will not be much of a deterrent. But for a MUCH more common abusive cases, it WILL be.  I also agree that leading people into a false sense of security is bad, but this is about offering them no protection over some protection.

Finally, I would also like to point out that  the ""security through obscurity is bad"" argument does not apply here. In order to argue that, you need to be able to achieve better security through transparency. This is an argument to be made for open standards, or open source - for revealing HOW a certain piece of technology works over concealing it. It's not for revealing geographical locations to random people. The ONLY security in this case IS through obscurity - it's just a matter of how. >'s literal function is to show you someone ""close"" to you

Yes, and it shows you different results now vs in 5 minutes. That means you get inconsistent results, which is worse.

 > this is about offering them no protection over some protection.

This is like saying that the fence you sell has now only a 1m hole instead of a 2m hole. It's still not secure.

>The ONLY security in this case IS through obscurity

No, the only actual security is turning this feature off. >Yes, and it shows you different results now vs in 5 minutes. That means you get inconsistent results, which is worse.

And this matters because... why? What REAL LIFE REASON can one have to care about whether a list of strangers fluctuate? How does that hurt anybody or anything?

&#x200B;

>This is like saying that the fence you sell has now only a 1m hole instead of a 2m hole. It's still not secure.

If bears of all sizes were roaming my neighborhood, I would rather I have a fence with 1m hole instead of a 2m hole. Sure, some 1m bears might come through, and some of them could be mean as well. But that's all the 1m-2m bears I don't have to worry about.

&#x200B;

>No, the only actual security is turning this feature off.

Contrary to what you may think, security is not about all or nothing. It used to be that you could either give your app ALL the permission it wanted or none at all. Are you saying that THAT system is the only real security and the current way of being able to obscure some of those permissions (and therefore information) from those apps is not security at all? This is some grade A mental gymnastics you are performing there. Inconsistent results are by definition worse. In real life that means that you get to talk to fewer strangers. We can agree that if you want to use this feature then you are interested in talking to strangers, right? If you get to talk to fewer strangers then that feature is worth less to you.

>Are you saying that THAT system is the only real security and the current way of being able to obscure some of those permissions (and therefore information) from those apps is not security at all?

Yes, because what you are selling is a fake sense of security. Call it whatever you want, but a bear of 1m width can still kill you. > In real life that means that you get to talk to fewer strangers

No it does not, because that is not how random works. It's equally possible for the number to stay the same or even to be bigger because people can just as easily get assigned to be closer to you as they can be assigned further away from you. 

> Inconsistent results are by definition worse.

Also untrue because...

1. It would not make a lick of difference because people using this feature to contact strangers are not surveyors who need an accurate headcount of Telegram users around them. They are bored people who are just looking for strangers to talk to. Who the hell cares if you meet 10 strangers as opposed to 12? Or 12 instead of 10? You honestly can see people complaining about this? Why would they? What would they even say? ""We got to talking and it turns out this guy was 11km away from me and not 7km like I thought. This is total bullshit""? 

2. As a matter of fact, if contacting strangers is a thing you wanna do, wouldn't you actually be stoked to find different set of people? Inconsistency would work FOR this feature, not against. 

Also while I am at it... It sounds like you just assume people stay stationary all the time. I know the pandemic feels like it's been going on forever, but the ideal use case for this feature would be to run it occasionally when you are at a new place and see new people, not see same people' s distance data update accurately, no? Who are these people who would care about the accuracy of the distance of strangers? I can literally only think of creeps - and I think we can all agree that it's best NOT to have too many of these as your user base. 

>Yes, because what you are selling is a fake sense of security. 

Riiiiight. So literally thousands of security experts who unanimously welcomed the change are... what, all part of a conspiracy? Do you also happen to believe that the earth is flat and we faked the moon landing? Is covid-19 being transmitted by 5g signals?

Sorry for all the sarcasm, but it's really hard to take you seriously when you've just been vaguely dodging my points this whole time and have given me zero use case where providing accurate location data benefits someone who just wanna talk to some stranger. Come back when you can back it up with a real use case that a real human might face."

Note the “sending unwanted messages to random strangers” part. The person you messaged could have been another user using the same username as your friend, or your friend doesn’t want to be in contact with you. Therefore, you were reported as spam and restricted. 

You can appeal in @spambot but by the time your appeal is reviewed, the restriction will be far in the past. FYI: I did report my case in English - but I honestly don't know if that is relevant.

Either way, my own case was different in that the restriction happened to me almost immediately after I created an account with a disposable number. The person I ended up talking to told me that the number had probably been flagged for spam - so I just assumed that the guy who had it before me did some questionable things. I'm sorry for the lack of detail here, but at the time, I was more concerned with proving I was not the same person, and less with how the number got flagged in the first place. 

I WAS allowed to sign up with the number, though; and I know that Telegram will actively refuse signup with certain numbers now. I don't know if that was because the offense associated with my number was relatively minor, or if it was because Telegram at that time had a more lenient policy regarding numbers flagged for spam.

I honestly don't remember exactly how the conversation went down, but I just made my case when asked the questions via automatic reply, and a person did get back to me. I don't remember how long that took, but it couldn't have been more than just a few days.

Like a hacker or something trying to access your account without your phone number, is that possible? Which was the most recent to be used (from the server's perspective). Yes, it is possible to intercept SMS messages. 
For this reason it is recommended to set a 2FA password to secure your account.

This password will be required every time a new client tries to log-in into your account. So, even if the SMS is intercepted they will still have to provide a password.
If you set a 2FA password don’t forget to set a recovery email because if you forget the password you will lose access to your account. what that looks like any idea?

But Telegram does not make your location publicly viewable to everyone on the Web like this claim implies. A warning dialog wouldn't hurt. Exactly. Someone has to maliciously exploit this to work. Agreed, it's not default, but still something users should be aware of. A lot of people don't realize that ""distance from you"" can easily mean, track exactly where you're located. On android, people have click ""People nearby"" > ""Make myself visible"" then there a confirm box. What more dialog you want? What does the confirm box say? does it explicitly warn you that anyone may easily track where you live? Genuinely curious. if you make your location public, shouldn’t you expect users to be able to find your location? You go out, and yelling I am here, wouldn't you expect people know you are there? Don't want people know where you are, don't publish it. For geeks, maybe. 

For non-techie friends and family? Not at all.

It needs to explicitly state that anyone will be able to triangulate every move your make from anywhere in the world. This is not the same thing the UI shows, which is just a ""distance from"" another user. Wet can agree to disagree, but the response from the Telegram team is pretty pathetic tbh. 

Telegram could have easily responded that that is an intended feature but that they would make it more obvious in a future release, this is not what happened. Instead they claim no responsibility and wash their hands of any fault. Is expect someone touting privacy to take a much better stance, when presented with info that may potentially compromise some of their users, intentionally or not. Most people would have an understanding that yelling I am here would let others near them find them. This is different than enabling a setting that reveals your identity to anyone no matter where you are in the world, and the app only briefly mentions that others may be able to find you. Telegram needs to explicitly tell users what malicious actors are able to do if they enable the setting. 


I don't see why you would be against alerting users who may not know the implications of turning this feature on. I'm not again warning users about this. I see there are enough warning for it already. This feature is opt-in, I see it work as intention, it not a bug, not a problems."

I've got my current most recent phone number that's also used for a telegram account that isn't really used.

I want to replace the old phone number with the new phone number for my main account, keeping the messages of the main account. Is there a way to do this? Will there be problems because the new number already has an account?";2021-01-05 02:19:34;" If you don't really use the second account... Do you even need to keep it? The easiest thing to do in this case would be to just delete the second account and free up that number for the first account to use. 

If you need to keep both accounts, then you would at least need another new number to transfer ownership of the second account. So If i delete the one I don't use and then set the number to what was that, that would still keep the main accounts chats and such?

I had no idea the number on my main was my very old phone number until today when I reinstalled windows. Only managed to get into my main because I'd saved the appdata from my old windows install where it was logged in still - so I now want to login that account somewhere else so there's a backup login, but I only have the phone which the other TG account uses the number for. I'll see if i can delete that one and swap the number over.

Also wondering, if I install the telegram app on my phone, does it automatically log in to the number of the phone is installed on? Or could I use my old phone number to log in there still using the code sent to desktop app? 1. Simply changing the phone number associated on your account does not affect the chats or other data - so yes, you would keep everything.
2. While it automatically enters in your phone number during the initial login process, you have the option of changing it before proceeding. So yes, as long as you have at least one active Telegram client to receive login verification messages from, you will be able to log into your old number's account from new devices.
3. I do still recommend that you change your main account's associated phone number to the one you currently have access to. Let's say someone who has your old number wishes to create his own Telegram account. He CAN ask for your account to be reset. ( [As can be seen here](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-into-my-Telegram-account-if-I-forgot-my-password) ). It is not safe to have your account associated with a number you no longer use.  


Edit: Grammar and clarity Thanks! Tried to get into the old phone and it's dead completely, and as it hasn't had the number used in like 2 years I expect that might be gone. Decided it was just safer to change the number, so it's least one that can definitely be accessed now."

As someone already said, you can use apps like textnow with a vpn to get a temporary US number. Most will likely already banned as telegram doesn't like voip numbers, but you can still try.

As for a temporary username, those don't really exist within Telegram. You can of course temporarily set a username, and while nobody gets a notification of you changing your username, they can see that it might have changed from checking your profile and noticing the username being different than before. There is no indication from Telegram that it changed however.

Hope that answers that. [deleted] Just get a phone number through a free texting app, and use that to make a second account. When you're done with it, you can safely delete the account all the way back to the texting app. If I change my ID to a random one, give this to a person, then I block it if a spammer and restore my ID can that person see the real ID? The issue is that otherwise I cannot begin a chat with a person. E.g. I meet online someone, I don't want to give my number ofc but neither my username (linked to my person). And I think that even if I temporary change my ID to a random one then all contacts (included the new meeted) can see it when I restore to the original one.
Don't know if I explained well, maybe is possible to begin a chat w/o sharing username too? What app do you suggest? I need something that I can recover if I log out all TG sessions, nothing illegal only lot of privacy with strangers Yes. I can only think of two reasons to have a separate Telegram account: Either to make sure people can't spam you, or to have deniability and say that account #2 doesn't belong to you, even to people who have account #1 in their contacts.

Otherwise, why not permanently have a meaningless username and just give it out to people? The first scenario isn't likely because most won't go through the trouble of creating extra Telegram accounts, and the second isn't something everyone needs. [deleted] > Just get a phone number through a free texting app

Be careful with those as they rarely retain private access to a number. If you use one, set 2FA (actually, always set it) so that if someone gets the same number they can't just try and log into your account. Thank you, so the only way is to have a second “fake” account Well, think of my username as a business card, I cannot change it for long time because of oherwise people cannot find me; at the same time I don't want to immediately give out my ID to a stranger, not at first contact (if online).
Best thing is if TG adds the possibility to have two usernames (one “real” and another one “temporary”).
Maybe I can block the contact but if I do this that person can see if I restore my username?

EDIT: The motivation is that I don't want spammers or stalkers. You cannot hide a username. The point of a username is to be publicly found in case you have no other means of contacting. [deleted] No, you literally cannot hide it. You can choose not to set one or to remove it, but you cannot not display it."

https://tsf.telegram.org/manuals/e2ee-simple#2-why-are-there-no-secret-chats-on-desktop-apps probably because android without root is more secure They won't be secret anymore once you can screenshot or record everything on windows. It's nor supported on Linux either yet. Maybe they will implement it for desktop this year. ""Telegram desktop"" app doesn't support secret chat on Windows, Linux and Mac Is it just a problem about recording or also about the e2e encryption of the messages? It is also possible on Android. I think you don't even need root. it was just ONE problem It's surely possible, but you would agree that it's quite more tricky on Android than on windows It's not any harder on Android, depending on the device.  On my phone I can screen shot by dragging the edge of my hand across the screen.  Any app at any time. Try it on a secret chat I've heard it is possible on Samsung devices and both Telegram and Snapchat don't show it. My previous phone allowed me to record the screen and the other side didn't get notification about it, so it's possible. The other way is to use other devices for recording/taking a photo :) If you try this on a secret chat, it shows a black screen and nothing more. 2 years ago it was possible, but not anymore I can't check it now. Are you sure it won't even work on Samsung? What changed? I don't really remember when because I don't use secret chats a lot, but I'm quite quite sure it won't work anymore"

Telegram Windows Desktop App Routes Through Phone App?;1;kpyxyk;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kpyxyk/telegram_windows_desktop_app_routes_through_phone/;3;[removed];2021-01-04 05:21:46;"No and no, the desktop app is entirely independent from your phone, also even if you clicked on a malicious link it wouldn't infect your phone because 

A-the link would open on your computer not your phone

B-Even if the link did open on your phone the amount of mobile malicious pages (that could somehow cause any harm to happen just by being there) is quite small as mobile operating systems are highly sandboxed meaning getting malicious code to escape from outside your browser is quite difficult (not impossible however) Thanks. Great answer.

I was on a crypto telegram group.The users there said to be becareful because some people on it were throwing around malware. 

I have Coinbase Pro on my phone, and although I have 6 digit login code, I'm concerned if I accidently click on a spoofed link or photo in one of those telegram groups that the hacker will lay low and wait until I log into coinbase pro and do something or maybe even see the 6 digit code as I'm entering it. 

Do you know how likely that would be? On Android that would only be feasible if the person somehow found an exploit to not only install an app without your consent but also either enable the required accessibility option which would be needed to read text boxes or somehow find a way to start a screen recording session without a user prompt.

I'm personally not aware of any exploit/exploit chain that would allow such thing (although it may not be completely outside the realm of possibility)

Just a reminder, these things aren't impossible to happen, every operating system has potential exploits that may grant elevated permissions to apps or code, they just aren't very common in mobile operating systems."

How telegram affords so much of storage space? Will they ever run out of disk space??;78;kpkrny;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kpkrny/how_telegram_affords_so_much_of_storage_space/;39;"I was wondering if Telegram will ever run out of storage/money and how it runs. Firstly, telegram keeps boasting on twitter that it could be used as a cloud storage and to do that, you can either throw away your files in ""Saved Messages"" or just create private channels and treat them as folders for different type of files. The files will be on Telegram's server forever until the user deletes them and they can upload up to 2GB of a single file. Even when someone asked if using telegram as an *UNLIMITED* cloud storage would violate its T&C, telegram replied by saying that its not of any issue(can't find that tweet as of now).

[Some tweets made by telegram boasting about it's cloud](https://www.google.com/search?q=telegram+cloud+storage+site%3Atwitter.com&oq=telegram+cloud+storage+site%3Atwitter.com&aqs=chrome..69i57.7666j0j9&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8)

Few screenshots:

Imagine everyone starts abusing Telegram's unlimited cloud and starts uploading files in their own private channels and I'm sure there are people who do this even if its a small group of people, more people are likely to do this in coming time. I know its inconvenient but at least it would save you money by not needing you to spend money on cloud services like google drive etc. 

With that said, wouldn't it be extremely hard on telegram's pocket to just keep acquiring more and more servers? With more server comes the need for more staff, more power consumption, more bandwidth consumption etc. Even if they're not running their own datacenter and just renting servers from third party companies, the cost will still be going up. Plus telegram doesn't show ads, they don't take donation and the only thing they say about how they financially run is ""We have received enough donation from Pavel for the time being"" on their FAQ page. Plus nowhere on their FAQ or T&C they state that they will delete user data if they run out of disk space.

This question has been killing me and I can't sleep peacefully until I get an answer :/.";2021-01-03 16:39:32;"Telegram has so far lived off of money from Durov. He has gotten quite a bit of money from selling VKontakte back in the day.

Telegram has announced that they'll be introducing paid features sometimes this year (iirc), which will help with future upkeep. Everyone has been asking the same question for a while. However apparently it is getting more expensive, so Durov announced that they will be some payed features coming to telegram next year, however all the functionality that exists already will remain free. Also there are apparently some data caps per day, for how much U can upload, however they are undocumented and only a few people apparently reached them, but there are no real proofs for that

Edit: I corrected the name, as I my phone corrected Durov to during the first time around I know this is sort of a non-answer but just storage itself is unbelievably cheap. Even if you uploaded an entire computer's worth of data, let's say 1TB or 1,000GB, that's only $20 at 2¢/GB. Also, there are ways to compress files down to squeeze more storage. Normal files losslessly compressed but media by default isn't sent as a file and has a really good quality / size tradeoff IMO. A 249MB 4K video sent via their HD+ option got reduced to 34MB and my guess is that for most chats people will choose that option 90% of the time. Storage isn't free, but most people aren't going to have the time or patience to use it for 100% of their files and most people probably don't have even $20 of data to send in the first place, so in reality it's probably not as expensive for storage than you think. I'm oversimplifying on just about everything. I think they're focusing now on how to get more people use Telegram instead of Whatsapp. I don't think they're focusing on profits right now. For example: Many people try to use Signal but can't because nobody in their circle uses it. It's useless if nobody in your friends, family or colleagues uses the messaging service. In the matter, telegram is unbelievably slow, so even if there is a daily data cap, unless you live in Dubai, there's no way to reach it. It will be paid soon as the dev has said of ads. About abuse, it is there. You can a lot of pornographic and copyright material. And it never gets away if it should not be there despite reporting. So anything that is free for long, is definitely having some hidden catch. Don't rely on it as a cloud storage, They once deleted my whole account without warnings or giving any reason. Straight up gone. Perhaps Telegram sells our data to get money??? Also it is always an option for Durov to follow Jimmy Wales’s way, when he run out of money :) Next year? You mean this year. You can read here about some calculation How does Telegram make money? telegra.ph / How-does-Telegram-make-money-08-01 (reddit bans the link). Google basically admitted few weeks ago that no matter how cheap storage might be, it is just not feasible enough to keep offering unlimited storage for something that cannot be monetized. Google Photos is getting billions of files uploaded to it on a weekly basis. Most of it would be optimized small files but it is still a lot of data. Telegram allows you to upload more than this and with 500 million users, it is still a lot of data to be stored for free with more data adding up on a daily basis. 

I do hope that Telegram is able to monetize this year with announced features. Enough to keep the service running for many years to come. Telegram's compression isn't very strong, regular files are generally not compressed at all (think of all the encoded movies being shared). The extreme slow bandwidth speeds may be part of how they can afford it, but if I had to guess, I'd say Durov's been silently pouring millions in since they announced the original 300k. Assuming they're not secretly selling analytics or data, of course. They have servers in Singapore too(nearest to my location) as I personally checked telegram traffic using wireshark. I have a 200Mbps(megabits) up/down connection and the max I get while downloading or uploading files is 3MBps(megabytes). The part about Dubai is weird, cuz they have servers located in Europe, and I personally never noticed that telegram uploads would be slower than for example Google drive uploads. However stuff like that can change fast and really depends on your internet speed Ik hence I don't rely on it too much. From what I know they just delete old accounts without any question But unlike whatsapp Telegram once publicity made a challenge to break their end to end encryption. Also they where banned from many countries since they didn't passed the encryption key to govt. So I don't think they will sell data. I’d rather bet my money and trust on Durov rather than Google, Tim Crook or Mark Suckicebergs. They sure could, but we have no reasons/evidence for that, so I guess we need to trust them every one keeps on saying this about free services. i have never understood... what is our data worth in the end? who is buying all this data? what are they doing with it? Yeah, you got me there. What can I say, it's last year's news) I think the Google Photos announcement is an issue unrelated to storage cost, for the most part. Google said themselves that a majority of their users will stay under the very small 15GB cap for a long time. It's a very different product, with automatic backup and a lot of machine learning processing going on with very high bandwidth.

Using storage as a way to monetize just happens to be the clearest way to monetize, I suspect. I think storage cost is a minor part of their overall cost, but there was no other way to monetize it and it's part of a larger shift from Google. Otherwise they'd have to develop new features or split off old features that were free to monetize. Admittedly, it does also fend off whales who could use the service to back up 24/7 HD footage, for example, which would take up a lot of storage very quickly, but I imagine there are terms of service which prevent that abuse anyway.

There are a lot of questions about how Telegram can afford to do X, but my argument is just that storage in and of itself is probably not that expensive. Yeah, but Google Photos basically stores all photos taken on every Android device, and a lot of iPhones too. They would have orders of magnitude more data than Telegram. Movies are already compressed, FYI. Not in latin america, no matter your speed, you'll get at max 1 to 2mbps uploads/downloads.

And that is for everyone I know using telegram. (I have a 350mbps up/down) Bro I was in the middle of texting someone and they just logged me out and my account was gone. Agree. Now it’s all about trust. So far there is no evidence of telegram selling data, and it’s fair that Durov publicly announced monetization instead of quietly selling it. I don't agree with the ""Telegram is selling our data point"", but I do want to point out that non-""Secret Chats"" are not E2E encrypted. ads, and money. or people with malicious purposes like identity thieves. 

  websites track and collect your data to make a specific profile based around you just so that you can receive personalized ads. selling your data to big advertising companies = big money, and almost every website and app does it. but this basically opens you up to the risk of identity theft and some privacy issues. 

  your data is worth money. lots of money. it's what drives society nowadays.

  edit: wE LiVe iN a sOciEtY Like how YouTube will use its info on you to suggest videos that will keep you watching more... and more ... and more Or maybe government arrests you because of your political stance but mate you are in different countries you won’t understand forever that's true. but telegram is used (and is mostly known for from what i have seen) heavily for file sharing and piracy. tons and tons of high quality audio and video content. and telegram of course do not have the resources (and revenue which is zero) of google! telegram hit 500 million users recently. google photos would be double or maybe even triple this number. it's just hard to imaging tbh, how much it must be costing telegram to host existing data already! Of course, not like we could share a full 70-120 GB file on Tele, lol. on purpose tho, E2E fucks up global sync for obvious reasons, and they aim for regular users who value usability over extra security, so making E2E optional is logical in their use case. I don't disagree, but it's important that people understand that their normal chats aren't end to end encrypted so they're informed."

Regarding about secret chat, does secret chat 'device-specific' also apply to the receiver?;1;kpjint;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kpjint/regarding_about_secret_chat_does_secret_chat/;6;;2021-01-03 15:03:15;"Yes Yes, secret chats are applying end-to-end encryption. This means that the message is encrypted in your device and gets decrypted on the destination device. Nothing, especially no server on telegram cloud, can decrypt it in the meanwhile. That's why it is only accessible from the device it was sent from and to (opposed, for example, to telegram-web-access as well) or cannot be backed up (since in that case the key should be shared with the backing external entity, or that the messages will be stored un-encrypted).

 Even if there's a ""man-in-the-middle"" and it reads the message, it couldn't do anything with it as it's still encrypted, and only you and the destination has the key to decrypt it. 

This is utterly important because regular telegram chat's are \*not\* end-to-end encrypted, and in that case it means that the server is also decrypting the message (or in other words, also shares the key). So if someone hacked the server / made telegram to give away users' data, your messages are exposed, while in secret chats they aren't. Thanks, so if my friend receives my secret chat instantly and had the same encryption key, does that mean we're safe from man-in-the-middle attack? What do you mean by the ""man-in-the-middle and it reads the message""? Does it mean thta he can read the message in english plaintext? Yes, you are safe if there is a man in the middle that taps the messages - they are encrypted (not in english plaintext) and thus he can't do anything with them."

For example, I would like to mute a member that is being loud in a voice call but only muting them for myself, allowing other members to continue listening in if they choose to. The ""deafen"" feature in Discord simply mutes everyone in the call only for the deafened person, while others who choose not to deafen themselves can still hear the others in the voice call. Sorry if I can't explain it well but I really want some client sided controls for voice calls without the need for administrator or moderator powers.

If you send a GIF or a video without sound (which becomes a GIF) it'll be automatically saved in your GIFs panel.

Try it. Send a video without sound or a GIF from the attach menu and you'll see it in the GIFs panel. As far as I know it was a years old photo that she hadn't used, but I will have her check that it wasn't used in a separate conversation. It popped up in the gif menu, but was a still image of her and a cat. So not that personal except for her general worry of her privacy as a whole.

I'll have an answer by tomorrow!

Havent seen someone with the issue on a non Ultra yet.

Please be sure to put a bug report in.

https://bugs.telegram.org/ Exactly my issue with the Note 20 Ultra phone of mine as well. Happened yesterday. Sent the file to my wife that has an s20FE and had her try to upload my file and it worked just fine. Sounds like something is going on with the Note 20 Ultra. I have the same exact phone and started having the same exact issue just recently. I have not been able to find out the culprit. Are they ever going to fix this? Super annoying, makes me want to just return my Note Ultra. 19mb and it's mp4 It's a 19mb size on android. It's mp4 format. It works if I set it to 720p This issue is present on my moto e5 using lineageos. And i also cannot upload a video as profile picture, it just stays there loading forever, might be related. Is it only in HD?... Mine only does it if the video quality is HD. Still no fix... What I've been doing is, if you press the crop button and barely move it to crop just a tad... It works. i meant if it’s recorded in something like HEIC or something, i know samsung has a similar option in their camera app 

it should work, since Telegram will process and compress the video to 720p, making it compatible in the process Put my settings to 720p and still no go. But it considers it HD as oppose to 1080p being FHD. Did you mean even lower quality? Ah yes, sorry now I know what you meant, yes, it works in the setting below HD but not HD. Not sure regular videos I download off Instagram... They use to work before no problem That's what's been the issue with mine :( Thanks for atleast giving me an option to send, I thought I was just SOL."

So… ""Good Evening""? Abbreviation of words - whether to make it a message shorter or to encode/encrypt it - will always be *in vogue*, I imagine.

I hear military wires, even in plain communication, were hard to deduce for the uninitiated. Wow send more of this Where is “GG well played?” These abbreviations were and are still used in Morse Code transmissions by the military and amateur radio hobbiest.  Their purpose was to decrease the time it takes to send a message by effective reducing the number of dots and dashes sent by the Morse Code operator. A skilled operator can communicate faster than most people can talk.

Example

It's worth noting that there are die hard traditionalist groups around the world that love using older and antique equipment from WW1 and WW2 and other groups who use the latest and most expensive radio equipment what integrated with internet and radio protocols (digital). This is for a very specific age group. My friends and I have never used these.

GG is good game, by the way. Nah it's for owls.

Private Channels vs. Private Groups: which one is best for archiving?;5;kndpj4;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kndpj4/private_channels_vs_private_groups_which_one_is/;4;"I’ve been using my Saved Messages usually as a “watch later” sort of thing in the past few years, and I just realized it has a huge amount of junk right now—more than 3000 messages/photos/etc.!

As a result I wanted to sort them into separate places so I can actually ditch them in a more organized way and also because some of them are quite handy/memorable (A dedicated place for memes, playlists, galleries, etc.), but I’m still stuck between creating a group for each category or a channel—which would only have me as their only member and admin.

Can you point out why any of them has a notable advantage or disadvantage when it comes to sorting content the way I want to?";2020-12-31 02:35:57;"Channels, and from a person that has managed both not really, Channels are basically no different in that regard, Also here's a tip for organizing your content, add a hashtag with the category of each post so you can easily find it later Only notable difference is that groups, when initially created, are ""normal"" groups. As I understand it, this means if you were ever to leave the group for whatever reason, you would lose all access to your material - even if you re-joined the group later. 

Of course, you can prevent this from happening by turning it into a supergroup by altering message history setting, admin setting, or by (temporarily) turning it into a public group. You can confirm that the change took place by trying to delete a message. If Telegram simply tells you that the message will be deleted from everyone, your group is a supergroup. If it gives you a choice to delete it just for you, then it is a normal group. 

With channels, you never have to deal with this, and all your data are guaranteed to stay intact (as long as the channel itself is not deleted)  from the moment you create a channel. I sometimes manage to use hashtags, but as most of the content are forwarded things from other sources it usually turns out having low functionality I forgot about the risk factors. Thanks for noting these!

(w/ Support for Full Screen apps/games);1;knco7m;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/knco7m/telegram_overlay_w_support_for_full_screen/;4;"Wondering if there's any recommended overlay for pushing Telegram messages to an overlay element. I don't need to have the ability to respond, I just want to make sure I don't miss anything (mostly when playing games, but it would be nice to have it overlay anywhere). Even though I can have messages open in a secondary monitor, since I don't get a triggered audio alert when I receive a message I still miss out because it doesn't call my attention to it.

I've seen there are some for Discord, but they all seem to require being self hosted, and the setup for this is out of my wheelhouse. I also found one for Overwolf but the window is basically a huge opaque window.. I was hoping for something small and discrete with support for a transparent background. I guess I'd be equally happy with something that would push audio notifications on top of the game sounds, ensuring the volume of these alerts muted or reduced the in game sounds enough to ensure I was notified.";2020-12-31 01:42:32;"I'm assuming you're talking about desktop, right? If so, I don't think there's anything like that, which is kinda sad, I agree.

I've even looked for a bot that will push Telegram to Discord, so I can get that piped in, but whatever seems to exist in that space needs me to dploy and host it, which is kinda outside my wheelhouse Im looking for PC, not mobile :)"

Anyway, I found out that when you enter a voice chat on the desktop version, it lowers the volume of other applications. This is similar to Windows' native option to lower things down by 80 or 50% while on a communication app. I disabled this option, so nothing gets lowered down whatsoever, but Telegram seems to be an exception. I googled about it and found 2 threads about this behaviour:

Literally half the page is ads and I cannot even couch the cookie banger away because an ad is dick at the footer of my screen.

If i read the title of the article right, there have been numbers leaked from a carrier? If that's the case, whats the big deal with Telegram now? If people care about their account in the slightest, they should set up 2FA anyway, as well as check their active devices regularly... Phone number requirement is a very good way to prevent flooding with spam, unlike e-mail registration Do people on Reddit *ever* read links before upvoting? This literally doesn't mention Telegram or even any other messenger. Yeah, some guy leaked a bunch of phone numbers from a careless service provider. How is that any different to millions of leaks where email addresses are exposed? And why is this relevant for this sub?  

Please read this suggestion that explains well how spammers will be dealt: [https://bugs.telegram.org/c/858](https://bugs.telegram.org/c/858)

TLDR:  if you create an account by email you are automuted on joining  groups  and you can't private chat to non-contacts. So you can't spam The big deal is that not all people use 2fa and a lot of accounts can be compromised I mean: a new way to sign up without pgone number that prevents spamming. E-mail registration + 3 CAPTCHA to solve (of differenti kind). Account created with e-mail registration can be flagged as spam automatically and do not be able to write to non-contact people. If you get access to the leak you can get access to those phone numbers. All services that requires phone number as login are relevant. If a user is a ""Ho. Mobile"" client and does not have 2fa on telegram, his account can be acquired. The whole point of this post is that phone number is not secure, in any way. Telegram should provide users another sign up method. Then you ask: how is it different from e-mail leaks? It's different because e-mail passwords are stored hashed. In the case of the article of the post, the information you need to obtain that phone number are in plain text.

Please help us improve this suggestion with your thoughts https://bugs.telegram.org/c/858 That's their fault, not Telegram's.

That being said, yes, SMS is absolutely not a secure way to authenticate, but it is a very good compromise to make many people able to get an account and make any step in the ""one person - one account"" direction, which is very much necessary since we already have too much spam this way. Spamming bots accounts in telegram can be, and I'm pretty sure are, created manually, as you don't need thousands of new accounts constantly, you only need a few every time. So yeah, you need phone number, and even with that we see that it is not perfect for stopping spam. I doubt it has significant effect against spam. You can buy SMS activations (or even activated tg accounts) in bulk for a few cents each. Imo the ""one person - one account"" policy actually helps spammers since people use personal accounts in public channels/groups where spammers find their victims. It's much easier to ignore PMs on secondary account than always having to think if you may know that person. Nobody is asking to remove the SMS sign up method.

[https://bugs.telegram.org/c/858](https://bugs.telegram.org/c/858)

&#x200B;

TLDR: if you create an account by email you are automuted on joining groups and you can't private chat to non-contacts. So you can't spam I'm not talking about a scenario where SMS is removed as a sign up method, either.

If spammers can sign up via email, they are going to have their life even easier than it is now. And the problem with spam is that they message people **privately** and, even when they don't spam by hand, most often than not they are definitely monitoring their accounts.

In other words, it seems like you think the problem with spammers is automated account creation and messaging, while, in fact, it is not (Telegram already easily spots and bans these accounts, and nonetheless this is very annoying). The problem with spammers is unsolicited, unwanted messaging.

EDIT: Okay, I hadn't read carefully, you're thinking about auto-spam-limiting email accounts. I don't really know if that'd work, but it surely would be a decent start. I know that for some time VoIP numbers were auto-spam-limited, but that didn't work out well...? I don't know why they are not anymore. But, as I know, you can make as many emails as you want, and also forcing to have an email from certain providers... will bring more hate than the current phone situation Maybe you didn't read what I wrote at the comment you are replying to: account created by email WON'T be able to start a private conversation You will be able to create how many accounts as you want, but you won't be able to spam

I know telegram links itself to your phone number. But maybe there is a way to make it possible? :(";2020-12-28 18:40:47;"You can change phone number easily, in the settings. See [announcement](https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-me-change-number-and-pfs).  
Roughly, Settings > Phone number. On desktop, Settings > Edit Profile > Phone number.  


Note you can't use that account to log out from the previous account immediately (you need to wait like 48h, for security purpose), so don't give away your phone immediately. Also make sure to do everything before the old number is deactivated (it *shouldn't* be a problem, but better safe than sorry). I successfully changed my number already. So does that mean I have to “delete” the telegram account my old number? I double checked the app and it shows my new number already, so is that good? Will all my chats and groups still be there after i changed my phone number and the old one becomes deactivated? Just saw the link! And it says i get to keep everything. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!! As you said just after (and for history purpose), yes it does. Nothing changes at all, you keep every chat, every secret chat, every group, channel,...   
Except of course now people can't find you by your previous number :) Will people in my contact list be notified that I changed my phone number? Is there like a notification for that? No. They won't get a notification, but may by able to see the change,  depending on your ""phone number"" privacy setting (if they look at it, no message/notification).  
If someone had your old number in their phone book, but your privacy settings don’t share your number with them, you will stop being their contact after changing your number. So if your phone privacy settings are set to ""**Nobody**"", nobody will see your new number after you change it. I successfully changed my number already. So does that mean I have to “delete” the telegram account my old number? I double checked the app and it shows my new number already, so is that good? All good :) you didn't create a new account, you modified the number of this one. So nothing to delete. If you also have a new phone, make sure you logout from Telegram on the old device, just by security. My country tends to recycle phone numbers especially for postpaid accounts for a telco. I am worried if somebody in the future would be assigned to my old phone number, will that person have access to my telegram account? (Sorry I have so many questions! I am just really concerned about privacy and security) Each account is identified by its number; its the UID. If you changed it, no reason someone with the old UID could access the account, since it's not linked anymore."

"Contacts from Iphone Imported Day After I ""Followed"" President Trump";0;klprns;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/klprns/contacts_from_iphone_imported_day_after_i/;0;"I was on the phone with Apple support yesterday with an *Ipad* problem. The tech support person for some reason never explained suggested I open up Telegram. Great Unwashed that I am, I obeyed. 

Now the day before, looking for a time-waster, I searched the app for people to follow. (One reason, but only one, why I followed the president.) The sole contact in my Contacts was a troll from a few months back. I blocked her/him/them. I use Telegram only to read posts from interesting people, most of them from another country, because I don't understand Telegram and never will. (I use no other messaging apps, so this isn't a criticism; I just don't understand ""bots"" and ""stickers,"" etc., etc.)

So my drawers dropped when the entire list of Iphone contacts appeared in Telegram. Luckily all contacts from my days in the adult film industry had names beginning with ""X,"" and I quickly ended the Apple screen-share. But the experience scared the shit out of me.

I became aware of Telegram only after a foreign notable migrated there from Twitter and urged his followers to switch up their social media affiliations. My non-partisan question is, Am I conflating two things that probably have nothing to do with each other--1) following President Trump; and 2) Iphone contacts magically populating an app I joined specifically because it was touted for its privacy?

For the record, I turned off Telegram's access to my Iphone contacts as soon as the tech support call was over. I'm asking this question because I'm still scared shitless. Telegram justifiably had no interest in little old me twenty-four hours earlier, and then, bam!

It is not secure because you might leave a country or are stuck to whatever that ISP policy is, so it is possible for that number to change ownership. Additionally if you have many accounts with that same number and you moved to a different country or region, you must manually change that number on all your accounts.

I thought that after some years Telegram eventually will have the option to use only Email as  an account identifier, and even add the option to not assign any email or phone, just a  unique generated ID code for each new user.

I assume this did not happen because you guys don't want it, or maybe our voice is not heard.

disclaimer, I don't use Telegram as my main drive because 1) I have no choice most people are not on Telegram 2) I hate using my number and because Telegram uses phone number it didn't give me the incentive to force family and friend to use telegram 3) It lacked features which now it have and much more, I love that about telegram.

Thank you for your vote

Edit on 2021-04-01: about 2 hours left, and it seems most Telegram users are like me and want Email(408 votes), and the second most voted which is requiring nothing, that is really interesting. And I read the comments and VMX made some interesting points, you should read that thread! 

I came to this realization, I don't mind my number being tied to my email but all other account I want them to be tied to my email, you ask why!? How dare you! Alright, I will answer you. You see I can change my number on my email if I had to but if all my accounts identifier are my number that creates  a huge mess for me as an ordinary user. 

Now about spam, you don't have to compromise privacy to have better control over spam, it is doable and the better AI and tech gets the better spam filter works. Again it is my humble stoopid opinion. 

about user base, VMX said that this way Telegram will grow it's user base.... Wellllll, at first I agree with VMX, but then I thought that sound unethical you should use this sneaky tricks to make your business grow, just be better, that how I came to Telegram it has much and much and much more feature that Whatsapp and it kinda advertise that it has better privacy. so I don't agree with forcing people to share their contact. Having said that, VMX should not worry because the majority will give access to their contact and eventually anyway. 

About why I wanted an Email as an identifier for my messaging app account, it is just a account management thing, after changing my number I saw how tedious and out dated it is to use mobile number, so many accounts to consider. 

Lastly, StoopidoMan thank every single 23 person who voted for me to be a president of Stoopdistan!

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kln8m3)";2020-12-28 12:20:12;"The only way to make a successful messaging app in this day and age is to use phone numbers as identifiers.

That's simply because, once you install the app, it can automatically scan your phonebook and you suddenly have 100 contacts... 90 of which you would've never bothered to ask their Telegram identifier to because you didn't even know they had the app. This network / snowball effect is what makes messaging apps grow enough to reach critical mass.

Otherwise their userbase remains so small that nobody can actually use them, as you'd have nobody to talk to.

WhatsApp figured that out before their competitors and that's why they became the #1 IM app on the planet in no time, while services like ICQ, MSN Messenger, etc. all perished.

Allowing people to use Telegram without a phone number in 2020 would be a a ridiculous, suicide move, and they know better than that. Email would be great but I don't think they will allow this. To prevent spam. With trashmails you can have unlimited email addresses and could create unlimited telegram accounts. With phone numbers you can also create multiple accounts but it's not that easy and you can't simply get unlimited phone numbers. Using phone numbers cuts down on malicious use. It's harder to obtain 10 phone numbers than it it 10 email addresses. My problem with email is that you can *easily* lose access to your account. Gmail is the most popular option and Google regularly bans people, in addition to, y'know, being Google. Same goes for smaller services - you could get banned or your account could get hacked or maybe they have a data leak like every other company these days. Paid secure email services are only with you as long as you got money.

Conversely, a phone number is much harder to lose. Nobody's going to take it away from you and even if you lose your phone you can just ask the provider to make you a new SIM with the same number. You can buy burner numbers and then add 2FA so the accoubt belongs only to you. Yes it is possible to own burner numbers even in this year. This is the only way to use telegram anonymously as far as I know. You can lose your account if you lose the phone number or someone else has the number, the email is much better and more privacy for the users not know your phone number or know that you are in telegram at all. What, no Cowboy Neil option? What has the world come to \>Telegram is advertised to private and security aware users   
about that, as any other mainstream messaging app telegram its not THE private and secure messaging app but is basically the best between the most popular ones, if you want something totally private and secure you can use something like signal I think registration with an e-mail or unique username would create a lot of spam accounts. On the other hand, I understand the need of anonymity. Because of that maybe, there could be a ""limited account"" option.

For example, if people choosed to register without their phone number, they would become a limited account. They mustn't start a chat with a regular user and join a grup by themselves or by a member invitation.

They could start a chat between limited users but, only could speak if regular user starts the chat first. And for the groups, they should added only by the admins. Or at least there should be an permission option for joining. Using phone is more secure against the most common security risk of all: Account takeover. Phone is “something you have”, which is harder by default for a bunch of script kiddies to take advantage of. 

Against a well resourced/state actor, phone numbers is less anonymous and less secure. 

Telegram is built for the “common person” so I actually think they’ve got the trade off right. 

Or telegram is an elaborate FSB intelligence honeypot and Russia reads all your messages to your gran. 

Either way it matters little; as telegram has access to all of your messages anyway, telegram is not secure by definition. 

If you’re looking for a secure/anonymous messaging system, telegram ain’t it. It is, however, by far, the most feature rich and convenient messaging platform around. Nobody is asking to remove phone number sign up, just to add another way The mail or Something else. Such as the @name you choose. It might be frustrating keeping unique also that but it’s already in use and it might just keep working that way For a messaging app, phone number is mandatory. Someone up there has explained what and why so I won't repeat it.

Signal though will allow its users to use the service without phone number. As a purely private messaging app, it's a welcome change. Telegram doesn't have that luxury since they're chasing WhatsApp as evidenced by their own twitter / social media approach -- their own limitation.

One thing for sure, Telegram won't beat WhatsApp since network effect is so strong. > Telegram is advertised to  private and security aware users, so I find  it weird that you are forced to use your mobile number which is really  neither secure or private. 

Phone number is more secure than email, Also you can easily purchase pay & go sim card (burner sim). But most social media wants a phone number now anyway.

>It is not secure because you might leave a country or are stuck to  whatever that ISP policy is, so it is possible for that number to change  ownership. 

You can change the number on telegram. First of all it's a messenger. It's supposed to be like this, easy to contact people and phone number is important to this. This year they introduced couple of options like not showing your profile even if they saved your phone number. Also you can hide your profile picture from non contacts.
I'm from central asia and sharing data using telegram is the way better than any other cloud services or social media apps. I'm not saying it's a best cloud but yeah it's a cloud.
It's accessible to everyone even people with low internet speed
You can basically hide your phone number, profile picture, last seen time and contact people with their username. If you don't want to share your phone number share your username I believe in Number-Independent services. Using cell phone number for auth I am giving up my contact book and becoming ""A Product"", not a user. email is a better option from privacy aspect! That is interesting! You are right, but does it hurt having Email as identifier along with username? Fair point. Its just too bad people I know who don't have a smartphone and only a landline can't use Telegram. Such as grandparents. My kids can't use the app either due to no cellphone so they're stuck on FB Messenger for Kids. also telegram has basically """"""""unlimited"""""""""" storage, letting people create an account just with an email would open tons of ways to abuse it Alternative approach, **active** accounts older than 1 year have the option to remove their phone number from their account because by that point I think it's safe to assume they're there for the long haul. (Telegram should still delete their inactive accounts after set period of time) I agree, but this is just an excuse to cover for the casual users, why not make phone number the default option, but also allow us to use email ? Well sms verification is usually only about $.50 a number so I don't agree. Phone and email are both archaic and shouldn't be trusted with your account. Why not just a username, password and 2 factor? it is easy to obtain 10 phone numbers for spammers and scammers. And most email services require a phone number when you register and if that phone number is used multiple time, you get banned. So having my number tied to one service is better than having it to many because when I am forced by the isp to switch to another I don't have to go and change my number on a billion and thirty four accounts > a phone number is much harder to lose. Nobody's going to take it away from you

> as long as you got money There should be more options. Number and Email, and this and that. 

Back to phone number being better than email, Your email is less likely to be banned than your ISP simply stopping your service because you didn't use it or paid, and worst is when you travel. for certain cases, yeah, but for an ordinary security/privacy conscious user who want to use an account indefinitely this is not viable, you could lose that number. Hm, I think it is possible to delete account, if you get the number. That joke's like 20 years old now, I wonder how many people get it well, I neither use signal or Telegram avidly, I love to test them but then most are on Whatsapp, line, wechat etc. 

And I Telegram does kinda advertise being more private and secure. I am wrong? That was my impression.

PS: Of course I know it is not the best solution, what I mean is that it does advertise being MORE private and secure than the mainstream app, I don't know how I got that impression!? when it comes to ""well resourced/state actors, I bend over. 

with security, I meant that you are not owning that number and there is no one conviction set of policy of Phone number system, I have been to few countries and lost ownership of several numbers just cause I didn't use them for 3 months. Meaning it doesn't work for all. Yes I get it, you can change your number, but why not give the option for advance users to user Email. It just make no sense why they didn't implement that option. 

another thing, since Whatsapp is more popular I get this question sometimes, that they got message that was intended for the previous owner, and that made me feel that it is creepy and not private. I give you guys an example, you leave your city to another, and your mobile carrier doesn't operate there, you change your number, and then after 6-12 months someone else get your number and they get your messages. Email don't have these issues.  

&#x200B;

> telegram has access to all of your messages  

That is another thing, the chat are not end to end encrypted, unless if you use secret chats. Would've been nice to have end-to-end encryption like whatsapp

 

>If you’re looking for a secure/anonymous messaging system 

I am not, just was curious and liked to see if others want more options too So Russia ban Telegram because FSB reads your messages? Are you ignorant? It doesn't hurt... as long as the phone number remains mandatory.

The moment you allow people to register *without* a phone number, you're essentially wasting your app's growth potential.

At the same time, you're opening it up to bots and spammers, since creating fake email addresses massively is trivial compared to setting up verifiable phone numbers. True.

However I would argue that it's very unusual nowadays for somebody to have a PC and not a smartphone. Typically it works the other way around: many people in the world don't have laptops, but both young kids and the elderly have at least a cheap 200€ smartphone to stay in touch in the their parents/relatives. Yeah, very good point... hadn't even thought of that.

Even more important to mandate something harder to fake than an email address. Still a bad idea, because new users who register to the app won't be able to autodiscover those old users who removed their phone number from their profile.

No matter how you look at it, phone numbers need to be mandatory and permanent if the app wants to have any success at growing and gaining market share. Anything else is suicide in a market where they compete with the likes of WhatsApp. As long as the phone number remains mandatory so people can discover each other, they can offer the email option, yes.

But as soon as they start allowing people to register *without* a phone number, there will be a non-negligible number of users who won't enter their phone number... and that would have a huge impact in their growth potential.

Even if 90% of users continue to enter their phone number, the reduction of the ""snowball effect"" would be massive, because these things are exponential: 90% \* 90% \* 90%...

It would be a terribly stupid decision by Telegram, which is why they will never do it. Everybody knows mandatory phone numbers are the only viable way to have a shot at making a successful mobile IM app in 2020. There are a lot of spam. They need some barrier to stop the spam otherwise not only the users but they'll gonna suffer too. Maybe in coming updates they gonna add this option too when they are ready. Still, most people can't access those services, mostly due to not knowing them. On the other hand, I think most people have more than one email address and know how to make a new one at a moment's notice. It's the same difficulty no matter who you are. There are a limited amount of numbers available, they're also regulated. In contrast I can register thousands of email addresses for free without a phone number as you can see [here](http://imgur.com/6cg8SN2) with Gmail— one of, if not the most, popular email services out there. yup, our phone number is under control. unlike Google account, we lose them at the moment shit happens and having money won't help at all Really? It's up to your ISP. For example last year I didn't pay for my number during the 6 month. Then service stopped but after a month I went to local IPS to get exactly that number so no problem As long as you are logged in on at least one device and have two-factor verification, you won't lose the number Afaik, you'll still have 7 days to migrate to a new burner number.

yes, source: https://core.telegram.org/api/account-deletion
""If the account's 2FA password was modified more than 7 days ago and was active in the last 7 days, account deletion will be delayed for 7 days, and a service message will be sent to the user"" Conspiracy theorists: to make you believe it’s secure Why the mud-slinging? 

I don’t believe this is actually what’s happening, I’m advising someone who asks about security that you can’t really trust Telegram either way. 

There are many examples in the past of elaborate ruses by intelligence agencies - some running for years. Look at the breaking of Enigma - the British has to let some convoys be sunk so the Germans didn’t discover that their cipher was broken. You can find many examples of intelligence agencies accepting short term losses for long-term gains. the bot and spam thing I disagree with you. As long as your email is the identifier and you have a special username, you wont get spam.

And spam with phone number are worse, it is easy to randomly messaging users, in fact my father recently got a pdf that he has to pay some tax's or something like that. These scammers/spammers got his number basically either randomly or from somewhere. 

And obtaining a new number is cheap and easy, the main issue for me is I don't own that number like how I own a domain name that I purchased. That may be dependant on locale. Usual or not, those people can't use Telegram. And that sucks. > Still a bad idea, because new users who register to the app won't be able to autodiscover those old users who removed their phone number from their profile.

I thought that's already a thing that happens when you hide your phone number in the privacy settings? I have mine set to only be visible to myself. My problem with phone number is ""portability"", for example if you travel and your local phone number doesn't work anymore and somehow you get logged out of Telegram, then you're screwed no ? With Gmail it is not always optional, it depend on your device, location and other metrics. You are right, but then getting many number doesn't take that much effort, you could even go for virtual number, what do yo think Indian tech scammer use. I self host email so I won't lose it unless my domain is taken away from me, which is extremely rare unless I go full criminal on it.

Similarly, there are paid email services and stuff like protonmail that are very reliable and won't take your shit away just because you trolled on YouTube comments. yeah usually I think the ISP park if for  6-12 month, but is this the norm in all countries, and what if you left the country, I don't like the idea of using a number as an Identifier, I try to avoid it. > gged in on at least one device and have two-factor verification, you won't lose the number

What do you mean, your ISP can simply stop the service if you are out of country for some period of time. If you have control of the account you can cancel the deletion order, I believe? Not sure. Yeah but that's a lot of fuss to keep an account. You actually compares Enigma to 256 bit AES encryption? >the bot and spam thing I disagree with you. As long as your email is the identifier and you have a special username, you wont get spam. 

This is not about you receiving spam on your phone number/email address. Neither of those need to be visible to anybody who doesn't have them already anyway.

What I'm talking about is **creating fake Telegram accounts massively**, so you can launch attacks against groups, post illegal and abusive messages, abuse the free cloud storage, etc. Banning accounts would no longer work because you could create hundreds of them in a minute.

>And obtaining a new number is cheap and easy, the main issue for me is I don't own that number like how I own a domain name that I purchased.

That is not true at all.

There are sites like [this](https://www.throwawaymail.com) where you can immediately create temporary email addresses, which you could use to create infinite (fake) Telegram accounts with little effort if they didn't require a phone number. And you could further automate this process with scripts and bots to make it massive.

Lots of other services (e.g.: Twitter) are abused daily using these systems, and Twitter removes thousands of bots every year.

Imagine what those people wouldn't do with a platform like Telegram, with infinite cloud storage, access to massive groups and channels, etc. They could basically destroy any chat by creating 1000 Telegram accounts in a minute and spamming it to death, sending illegal material, use the free storage massively for piracy (even more than today), etc. etc. It would be a mess.

There are ways to obtain free phone numbers, yes, but it's a lot more complex to automate and scale up.

Phone numbers have to be registered in actual carrier databases in each country so they can be reachable for SMS/phone calls, and they belong to a specific country with a specific prefix. The amount of phone numbers available in each country is limited... you can't simply create them out of thin air like you can do with email addresses. That's why most ""virtual phone number"" services have strong limitations and you can't just create 1000 numbers for free in a minute. Yeah probably.

I live in Spain and this is definitely the case. From my interactions with people from other European countries (Italy, UK, Portugal, Ireland, Germany...), I think it's similar over there too.

I also know for a fact this is the case in most third world countries:

Laptops are more expensive and not very practical to move around, plus the infrastructure for fixed networks is less developed than mobile networks so you'd need a phone anyway to have internet access. People just get a cheap smartphone that they can always carry with them and they have internet most of the time over 3G/4G. What I'm saying is that the number of Telegram users would be ridiculously low if they allowed people to register without a phone number, due to the network effect described above.

Those email-only users would be able to register, yes, but would they want to? Probably not, because nobody they know would be using the app in that scenario. Telegram would've never, ever reached the 500 billion users it has today. In fact, it would've probably been discontinued/abandoned by now.

You can hardly argue that more people would be able to use the app with a system that would've probably killed the whole project due to lack of user adoption.

And again, I really struggle to imagine just about anybody nowadays (young or old) having a PC but not a phone. Using phone numbers is definitely the way to go. Hmm I don't think it works that way. From [here](https://telegram.org/faq?setln=uz#q-who-can-see-my-phone-number):

## Q: Who can see my phone number?

On Telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making your phone number visible. By default, your number is only visible to people who you've added to your address book as contacts. You can further modify this in *Settings > Privacy and Security > Phone Number*.

>**Note that people will always see your number if they know it already and saved it in their address book.**

So basically, you can hide your phone number from people who didn't already have it in the first place (e.g.: people who added you by username/email address, people who met you in group chats, etc.).

But even if you choose to hide your phone number from ""everyone"", **people who already had your number in their phonebook will still dicover you as a Telegram contact straightaway.** Phone number always remains as your primary Telegram identifier no matter what.

As said, making an IM app grow and gain critical mass in today's hyper-competitive market is already terribly challenging by itself, even when you do everything right. If you go ahead and remove or somehow hinder something as crucial as phone-based contact discovery... you're straight up killing your own app. SMS is only used for initial registration. After that, they send you a Telegram message for 2-factor authentication, not an SMS. So all you need is an internet connection.

Unless you purposely log out of all your Telegram devices, you'd never face that problem. The same thing as if you logged out of your Google/Gmail account in every single device, then you'd need to resort to an SMS.

Furthermore, in most countries you will always port your number across operators, which means people nowadays keep the same number for their whole life.

Every method has drawbacks, it's just that phone number-based ID has the least drawbacks of all methods for the vast majority of people. Well, except email, phone number is the best option for me. Also if I would leave the country maybe I would buy new number and change it otherwise I can turn on auto paying via card so ISP won't do anything☺️ You don’t need to have access to the physical sim to use it as telegram. If you are logged in on at least one device, you get your code in telegram. The new sim owner can request the code on their phone, but they won’t be able to pass the 2-factor verification, meaning that they won’t be able to log in into your account or delete it Yeah, I did it recently and it definitely needed a confirmation. I think that's where you get the code, but not certain. I only noted that it was smart so someone who isn't logged in as me can't confirm deletion Not really. I have my main account and 2 more for channels / pub. groups - all registered with cheapest russian burners, main one for over 3 years. Although I do get login attempts from time to time, I didn't have to migrate so far. (And it wouldn't be much of a hustle anyway) Not in the slightest and I don’t understand how anyone could have read my message in that way. 

I’m using the breaking of enigma as one example where an intelligence agency accepted some loss (some convoys) for a larger gain (saving a larger amount of convoys). 

In the same way that FSB might accept a ban on local telegram connections for an ability to read telegram messages abroad. 

I have no evidence that this is happening, of course, nor am I even believing it myself. I’m simply saying that it wouldn’t be the first time intelligence agencies hide their ability to read messages in an elaborate way. That is a cool thoughtful comment, but it works for twitter and facebook, and so many other sites, and Telegram can ask a number for verification but your  email will remain the main identifier. I see it from being an ordinary user prospective. I am old StoopidoMan, and I have many accounts and if all of them were connected to my number, I will go through hell when I change my number. That why I only use two factor authentication on my email account and all the other accounts are recovered using my email. Ah. I'm in central Canada and from talks among friends, family, coworkers - most elderly are anti tech and use a landlandine. Not all of course. 

And kids is hit and miss at the age a parent will give them a mobile phone of their own. I totally can't imagine the effect you're talking about, because I can't relate to it. I don't even have my friends who I chat with using Telegram in phone contacts. I wouldn't even think about adding them to my phone contacts. To me a phone network (in regards other than providing internet) is this obsolete thing that you use to call for a taxi, or your grandma. Huh, well that sucks.

Discord seemed to have taken a life of its own even without requiring phone numbers. Maybe Telegram should've targeted the gaming space at some point. I don't think so, the new owner can get an account with your number and new messages intended for you. I am using one from Textnow ;) They're even better than those paid ones. Hi can u share where to get burner numbers? I did understand your comment correct. My point was that it's very difficult to break the encryption in the first place. We can all be paranoid - but there has to be a limit. A lie told often enough often becomes truth. So every time people mentioned that Telegram is FSB spying on you or VPN is not even encrypted (even though FBI and Europol has closed a VPN service recently) people begin to believe in this BS. 

They should swallow their prescription medicine instead of being on Reddit. ;). >but it works for twitter and facebook 

Twitter is removing [more than 6 million accounts per week](https://www.fastcompany.com/90331696/twitter-is-automatically-removing-about-10-accounts-every-second). Facebook is also taking desperate measures to fight the same problem, going as far as [forcing people to provide proof of their real identity](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/facebook-real-names-1.3367403). Despite their efforts, they're also having to [remove BILLIONS of fake accounts](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/facebook-removed-3point2-billion-fake-accounts-between-apr-and-sept.html) every year.

So I would hardly say it's ""working"" for them... more like they're ""coping"" with the problem the best they can, dedicating a vast amount of resources to detect and delete fake accounts.

>and Telegram can ask a number for verification but your email will remain the main identifier. 

They could, but then Telegram would be dead as a messaging app for the masses. As stated above, you'd lose the network/snowball effect of contact auto-discovery through people's phonebook, which is the #1 reason to use phone numbers as primary identifiers.

The spam/bot issue is just *another* problem Telegram doesn't need to deal with, and so another reason why they made the right choice by going with phone numbers.

>I have many accounts and if all of them were connected to my number, I will go through hell when I change my number. 

Nowadays number portability is quite ubiquitous everywhere, which means most people never change their phone number throughout their entire life unless they move to a different country. They just carry their number with them when they switch carriers. That's why most people today are fine with 2FA through SMS.

Also phone numbers are very difficult to hack/impersonate, since they're tied to a physical SIM card that has a PIN. And even if they steal your phone/SIM card AND get your PIN, you can just call your carrier and they will easily verify your identity and lock the SIM, since you're legally tied to it as a customer. You can also report it to the police and they'll immediately issue a warrant to locate your phone through mobile network positioning, which carriers are legally required to comply with.

With email addresses, though, if somebody gets your password/secret question... you're done. They could seriously destroy your whole digital life in a day and they will never get caught. That's fine as your personal experience, but you have to understand that you are inside an incredibly small minority.

Phone-based IM apps, such as WhatsApp, have taken over the world and are now the de-facto standard for people to communicate. There are many countries already where WhatsApp has a [penetration of >90%](https://i.imgur.com/Id6WiCF.png) (which in reality is 100% if you discard second phone numbers and people who don't text at all yet). Phone numbers are quickly becoming everybody's #1 identifier everywhere in the world, and the trend is only going to continue growing.

>To me a phone network (in regards other than providing internet) is this obsolete thing that you use to call for a taxi, or your grandma.

Well... some people would argue that mobile networks are the biggest achievement in this century, as they have democratised access to both internet and peer-to-peer communications to billions of people on the planet who don't have access to a PC or a fixed internet line.

I don't quite get how you can decouple the ""providing internet"" part from the network itself. Where do you think 95% of the work and innovation goes in mobile networks? Precisely, to provide and optimise internet access to customers. That phone network is also what you use to send Telegram messages, watch YouTube videos or book a Uber.

All voice calls, text messages and the rest of data packets go over the same internet access they give you. They do so by identifying you through your MSISDN (the phone number associated with your SIM card), all seamlessly, encrypted and without you having to do anything. It's the whole reason everything works in the first place, and it's more secure than almost any other alternative you could think of when it comes to identifying and authenticating a user.

Also, the technologies used for wireless communications in mobile networks (standards like LTE and 5G NR) are basically state-of-the-art when it comes to complexity and innovation. Many of the technologies and features developed for mobile networks are later adopted by less advanced protocols, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Mobile networks are basically the F1 of wireless technologies.

There's a reason why companies like Huawei or Ericsson are amongst the most valuable in the planet you know...

I struggle to understand how anybody could consider mobile networks ""obsolete""... they are quite the opposite in my opinion. Yeah Discord has been doing very well, but as you say it's a very different market. Clearly PC-first, with mobile messaging as a side thing.

For apps focused on mobile messaging though... phone number seems to be the only real way to have a chance nowadays. Is that what you think because you aren’t using telegram? 

Well the reality is different and I mentioned it in my 2 previous comments. I have multiple accounts with numbers I don’t have access to anymore and even in this post someone mentioned having the same and have the owner try to access the accs, and you just cancel their attempts.

Maybe you should do your research or basically just try to break into your account using sim without telegram app and see for yourself yep. I made one just to make a username and use it as a annon account in groups. simple. Will u lose your account if the number gets recycled back? Wow cool, I am interested to know your technical background, are you cool sharing it? 

&#x200B;

Also do you know how many spamming account telegram removes daily? Is it too far from Twitter and Facebook? 

I get your perspective I think you worked in software development, but my perspective is as a user, so  do you understand these issues:

1)  leaving the country or switch carriers, not all ISPs let you keep your number when you switch. And it is not possible in all countries to keep your account active by using roaming and paying with a credit card. 

2) Also, when you want to change your number, maybe you are harassed or stalked, then you have to change that number on all your accounts, for me, I literally have more than a thousand accounts, changing the number on all of them looks too tedious. 

3) about Telegram dying if the Email was the identifier, I think 90 percent of users would enable access to their contact. and if both email and number is an identifier that would work. Of course the Email would be the main identifier to login/ recover.. 

4) and what about this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM\_swap\_scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam) 

could you explain it please?

5) I read a comment here with a cool suggestion, why not have email and phone number, but limit the email accounts so they could not initiate a chat unless if the other person started it. it will not hurt

&#x200B;

You seem to understand what you are talking about, but for me, I have an email and spam is rare these days, I guess those who use email to massively send email get suspended immediately and I think also asked to provide a mobile number... Wait, what if all the Email service providers asked for Mobile number as a spam preventing measure, and you used that email account on all other service as an identifier, technically like login in with google. Because you completely misunderstood me. What I mean is that for me the only modern use of the phone network is providing internet. That's why it hasn't ever crossed my mind to ask my friends for their phone numbers. We just text (and talk too) using internet-based communicators. I didn't say the technology is obsolete.

As a side note, to my knowledge Huawei and Ericsson produce devices, not provide service, so I have no idea how is that even related can you prove that with a help article on telegram website, because it would be an fair, sometimes you inherit a new number that was owned by someone else, who left the country, stopped using that number etc. so that means they can't use that number!? 

And it also is bad for security, a scammer could get many virtual numbers and physical SIMs and then disregard them and cancel their attempts. Hi can u share where u get burner numbers? Sure. You have to write at least one sms (it may be any number, even those where you got code by sms) once per month. If you forgot, you can get another number and just update it in Telegram. I don't how it works, if you enable 2-step authentication. \[1/2\]

Sorry for the delay... was kind of disconnected these days.

>Wow cool, I am interested to know your technical background, are you cool sharing it?

Sure, thanks ;)

I've been working on mobile networks for about 9 years now. Mostly on the radio side of things (so, the communication between devices and the base stations), but in the last few years I've been working on a wider variety of things. Mostly innovation projects.

I wasn't a dev, but I was managing technical projects and often doing tests myself and getting my hands dirty :)

Now I'm just moving to a dev role this year, but that's a first for me!

>Also do you know how many spamming account telegram removes daily? Is it too far from Twitter and Facebook?

Yeah that's a good point. I haven't found a lot of info, but I did find [this article](https://kun.uz/en/news/2020/02/17/telegram-deletes-false-accounts-channels-in-uzbekistan-lost-nearly-4-million-fake-subscribers):

>The method for increasing number of channel subscribers using fake accounts has been invented in South Asia, and since then some “entertainment” Telegram channels in Uzbekistan have also been using it. **As a result of previous clean up, there has been a sharp fall in the number of channel subscribers that have used such an unfair way.**  
>  
>They used this method to deceive their advertisers by pretending to have a lot of users, while in reality they were fake accounts and bots. Since the announcement of the fight against bots and fake subscribers, those channels have lost thousands of users.

So I get the feeling that somebody found an elaborate loophole that probably requires quite a bit of work, but could be worth it for those situations where more subscribers = more money.

But it seems the usage is going down because it's not worth doing when Telegram can easily shut it down.

Creating temporary email accounts, on the other hand, is trivial and can be done in the thousands at no cost.

>1. leaving the country or switch carriers, not all ISPs let you keep your number when you switch. And it is not possible in all countries to keep your account active by using roaming and paying with a credit card.  
>  
>2. Also, when you want to change your number, maybe you are harassed or stalked, then you have to change that number on all your accounts, for me, I literally have more than a thousand accounts, changing the number on all of them looks too tedious.

Yeah I totally understand of course.

It's just that the vast majority of customers don't usually move to a different country permanently. So even though it's an issue for those who do, most people don't have a problem with it and so the benefits outweight the cons.

I agree with you that it would be a mess if ALL your online accounts were tired to your phone number. But because this only applies to mobile messaging apps, and people tend to use 1 or 2 IM apps at most, it really takes like 3 minutes to do.

It's quite easy and straightforward in both Telegram and WhatsApp to change your phone number.

Probably one of the easiest things you'll need to take care of if you completely move your life over to a different country :)

\[continued below...\] >Because you completely misunderstood me. What I mean is that for me the only modern use of the phone network is providing internet. That's why it hasn't ever crossed my mind to ask my friends for their phone numbers.

Well, at some point you will get a job and you'll have to provide an official way to be reachable for work purposes, for legal matters, etc. Do you think they will accept a Telegram/WeChat/Skype account? No, they will ask for a verifiable, secure identifier, provided by a telecommunications company who can vouch for your identity and which is subject to government regulation. They can guarantee that it's you who's paying for that identifier. And that identifier is your phone number.

Third party apps may exist today, but they'll give you no guarantee that they'll exist tomorrow, and your identifier could vanish, or they could change their business model, restrict access to their services, etc.

Eventually, everyone around you will be in the same situation, and all your contacts will be exchanging phone numbers as well. Third party apps will come and go, you may switch from Telegram to something else, but phone numbers will stay with you and you will eventually use that with friends as well because it's easier. That's how life goes.

>AS a side note, to my knowledge Huawei and Ericsson produce devices, not provide service, so I have no idea how is that even related

[Huawei is the largest provider of mobile network equipment in the planet](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-69855590,quality-100/gfx.jpg). Ericsson is the second.

Mobile operators all over the world are building their networks with Huawei/Ericsson equipment for base stations, antennas, core network, etc. Nokia is a distant third nowadays (and falling).

Ericsson stopped selling phones almost a decade ago by the way. All the help there is is on telegram website. They have a small team so their support section isnmeager, and their support is a team of volunteers that are never online. I learned more on this sub and reading web-security guides than anywhere else.

However, you don't need any prof to check what I said. Install telegram on several devices, and activate 2-factor authentication. Then delete the app from the device that has the sim and try to enter into your account without using other accounts and the email (as the new owner wouldn't have access to them). You'll see for yourself \[2/2\]

&#x200B;

>3. about Telegram dying if the Email was the identifier, I think 90 percent of users would enable access to their contact. and if both email and number is an identifier that would work. Of course the Email would be the main identifier to login/ recover..

The problem is, if you aren't required to provide your phone number, then others won't be able to find you. And don't forget most people will always use apps on their ""default"" setting.

So if they register with their email and everything else is optional, they will skip everything else. That means a huge percentage of people would not enter their phone number into the app, even if they allow access to their phonebook.

Also keep in mind that these things scale expontentially, not linearly. So even if, say, 90% of people enter their phone number, the amount of people who can see each other is 90% \* 90% \* 90%... the impact would still be huge. Devs know this and that's why they always make the phone number mandatory for their apps.

>4. and what about this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM\_swap\_scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam)

If you read the article, that fraud has nothing to do with technology. It's a very complex social scam, 100% manual and very time consuming:

>The scam begins with a fraudster gathering personal details about the victim, either by use of [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) emails, by buying them from organised criminals,[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam#cite_note-3) or by directly [socially engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)) the victim.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam#cite_note-:1-4)  
>  
>Once the fraudster has obtained these details, they then contact the victim's mobile telephone provider. **The fraudster uses social engineering techniques to convince the telephone company to port the victim's phone number to the fraudster's SIM.** This is done, for example, by impersonating the victim using personal details to appear authentic and claiming that they have lost their phone. In some countries, notably India and Nigeria, the fraudster will have to convince the victim to approve the SIM swap by pressing 1.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam#cite_note-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam#cite_note-6)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam#cite_note-:1-4)

That's why it's typically only used with high-profile victims (such as Twitter's CEO, politicians, etc.).

Also I should point out that, as far as I know, this is not possible in most countries, as carriers will never port your number to an existing SIM card that you already have.

Instead, they will always send you a **new, fresh SIM card**, which they will only deliver to your real home address, or hand it over to you personally in a retail store (where you have to show some form of ID).

Furthermore, the SIM card is normally delivered in an inactive state, and you need to call them again to activate it (proving it's you again).

Needless to say, this is extremely difficult to pull off, similar to stealing someone's bank account or credit card details.

It's much, MUCH easier to steal somebody's email address (all you need is the password/secret question), and in fact most hackers typically steal the victim's email address as an easy first step before hacking something else.

>5) I read a comment here with a cool suggestion, why not have email and phone number, but limit the email accounts so they could not initiate a chat unless if the other person started it. it will not hurt

All valid suggestions, but in the end they all hinder user adoption due to reduced contact discovery and extra steps. Why would Telegram do that?

If you download WhatsApp, you can instantly text everybody in your phonebook, and so can they.

Then you try Telegram, and if it was using that system, it wouldn't force you to enter your phone number... but because you only entered your email now you can't start a coversation with a friend until he texts you? But... he can't actually text you either, because you didn't enter your phone number so you're not showing up in anybody's contact list??

Why on earth would 99% of users go through all that hassle? I guarantee you, they would all uninstall Telegram immediately and go back to WhatsApp. User adoption: zero.

You have to understand that this is not a new problem. People much smarter than you and I have been working on this for years, they've gone through trial and error and spent millions on their projects... and they've all reached the same conclusion.

When it comes to mobile IM apps, you need to:

1. Mandate phone numbers as the primary identifier
2. Do automatic contact discovery through your phonebook

If you don't, the app will never become mainstream.

It might be used by some small niche groups, it could cater to more techie users and nerds, specific PC-based communities, etc. But if your goal was to become the IM app for the masses (like Telegram wants to do), you can forget about it.

Sorry for the long comment(s). You had many questions ;) > Well, at some point you will get a job and you'll have to provide an official way to be reachable for work purposes, for legal matters, etc.

That's a fair point, although I still dream about some decentralized e2e encrypted internet-based solution that doesn't depend on a specific app and is easy for non-techies to use, but I admit that I don't see anything like that on the horizon so that's where phone number-based communication is gotta stay for now

> Third party apps will come and go, you may switch from Telegram to something else, but phone numbers will stay with you and you will eventually use that with friends as well because it's easier. That's how life goes.

Pretty sure we won't, we'll just use a different third party app

my bad why sorry!? I should thank you for the long comment, I agree with you, and some of my questions was to incite more thoughtful on this because I am sure many will come here in future reading our discussion. 

But at the end I understood that Telegram can have both, by default number and a kinda hidden advance option to use Email/unique ID (some apps do that,)  and it can be prohibited accounts if you do so, meaning, you can't join channels  and or contact someone with a number unless if they contacted you first. Then you have the best from both worlds. That what I have learned from this post. And the most important thing I learned is that most people who voted, they want Email and unique completely unconnected identifiers which with the way I explained is possible without affecting userbase, nor spam/security. 

Again dude, I love awesome dudes like you on Reddit, I learn and improve all the time. Sure, I also enjoyed our conversation ;)

It's a topic that I like, and I also worked a bit on RCS and messaging-related projects many years ago (a European carrier-driven initiative called Joyn, meant to ""compete"" with WhastApp). So always interesting to talk about these things!

Have a nice day, and of course a happy new year ;)"
Encryption of Voice Chats;10;kln3s7;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kln3s7/encryption_of_voice_chats/;13;Since there is no info in the blog post: Could anyone provide details about the encryption of voice chats?;2020-12-28 12:09:25;"Unfortunately, there's still no techical info on [https://core.telegram.org/api](https://core.telegram.org/api), so we cannot say for sure, only by digging through the updated source code for Android, iOS and Desktop apps You can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kjqk7u/are_group_voice_chats_encrypted/ggz9ig8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). [deleted] https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end/video-calls Group voice call ≠ Group voice chat Incorrect. Chats don’t have an option to hide your IP. However, no chats should reveal your IP either. 

What you may have meant is that chats have an option to be end to end encrypted, which is the term commonly used to imply that telegram can’t read your messages. Of course, you’d have to take telegram’s word for that. 

There are no public details for how voice chats are encrypted, AFAIK. Again, you’re trusting Telegram even if there was, as the apps are closed source. Video calls are not voice chats They are the same and they use MTProto [https://core.telegram.org/mtproto](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) (not e2ee). What are you talking about? [The apps are all open source.](https://telegram.org/apps#source-code)

Not to mention [their end to end encryption is documented too](https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end).

What you might be thinking about when it comes to ""trusting telegram"" is their MTProto, which is used for cloud chats and is the most criticized part of the platform. You can find the documentation on that [here](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto).

~~As for there ""not being any public details on how voice chats are encrypted"", please see [this public document about how voice chats are encrypted](https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end/video-calls).~~

EDIT: Forgot the new voice chats thing, friends have interchangeably used ""chats"" and ""calls"" when referring to the already-existing call feature. My bad! Consider opening the link before you answer next time.

EDIT: I thought you meant calls, my apologies. Forgot they have a new thing. But you cannot verify that this is the binaries that make it into the App Store! There are no way of verifying the integrity of the apps. 

I’m not out with my tin foil hat. I’m an avid telegram user. I’m simply saying that looking for safety, anonymity and security should make you look elsewhere than telegram. It’s a black box and the encryption process isn’t standard so may very well have a weakness known to one or many intelligence agencies. 

I don’t care either way - I’m texting cat gifs to my friends - but if I did, I’d choose something else than telegram. Signal or similar. >But you cannot verify that this is the binaries that make it into the App Store!

[Yes you can](https://core.telegram.org/reproducible-builds) I can on F-droid because the compilations are signed Ha, what do you know?!

I hadn’t seen this before. Thank you for pointing it out. I was wrong. 

That said, you’re still relying on their servers and their proprietary encryption."

Video orientation issue for cross-platform video calls;4;klhk1c;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/klhk1c/video_orientation_issue_for_crossplatform_video/;2;"I couldn't find a place to send direct feedback or suggest an idea to  the Telegram so I am writing this subreddit instead. There is a telegram channel and a subreddit for this kind of ideas but they all seem very inactive for years.

My problem is that when I made a video call from my Windows PC using the desktop client to an iPhone, there is a small detail that makes my experience very bad. Because my webcam catches video in the horizontal orientation but her smartphone was catching it in vertical (portrait) orientation. This made the person 90 degree rotated for me for my desktop client.

I really believe there was no problem for the person on the smartphone as far as I know. But I couldn't find a solution for Desktop client to rotate the receiving video source while doing video call.

I am not a very good tech guy or programmer but all I know is telegram client can know what orientation the devices are and decide to rotate the videos according to a simple rule set or can give the users to rotate manually. 

I hope my message can approach to the developers. I really don't wanna rotate my head 90 degrees to see the real footage :)";2020-12-28 05:48:19;try adding a card/ticket to bugs dot telegram dot org Yes I also have this issue!!

I build the bot you might like to use: TheDigestBot

There are 2 main reasons to use it:

1. If you have tons of channels. The bot collects your subscriptions and generates a Digest. You decide when you'd like to get updates (you can set multiple schedules).
2. If you want to run channel, but do not have time to create content. theDigestBot allows you to mirror your digest to a public channel (use /mirror command first)

I've tried with vids recorded by default camera and vids downloaded from imgur (mp4) and from reddit

I've tried both local and SD card

The app tries to compress before upload and it immediately fails

I can upload without compression Will do. Thanks hi did. and post that on regular version isn't work Read the post. Literally a screenshot of regular TG and OP said it works in TGX Hmm that's rather weird indeed You find a fix?  Note 20 Ultra here.  Was either after A11 or the new version of telegram.

Works fine if you record from the gallery though. Haven't found a fix. Also note 20 ultra. What do you mean by record from the gallery? I have same problem, must be a Android 11 issue.. Attach an image to a chat, click the preview camera so it pops up.  (Upper left), then record and send a video that way.

Does that work?  You are the first person I hit with this issue, and I wanna test an idea.

If it works, it means that Telegram is unable to access whatever its using now for video conversion for some reason. Hello,

I just want to let you know that this issue also happens on my moto e5 with lineageos, this issue is very old btw. Also, i cannot set a video as my profile pic, i think both issues are related.
So if you report it, pls mention that some lineageos devices are also affected.

Thanks. You on a one UI phone? This worked, but I can't tell if it's being uploaded to the cloud (compressed) or not [removed] Yeah, Note 20 Ultra with OneUi 3.0 now. You sure seem stable.  Get a temp ban for being thirsty, and then follow me around?

Should Telegram or a third party bot make a collaborative message editing feature? Do you think it would be useful?;6;kk9g2c;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kk9g2c/should_telegram_or_a_third_party_bot_make_a/;0;"I am currently a college student and I notice this trend of updating bulleted or numbered message through copying and pasting when you need to do something important. For example, it could be an attendance, a checklist or when you and your friends are working together solving an activity. Examples would be:

List of People Who Attended Google Meet

1. NAME
2. NAME
3. NAME

Sizes of T-Shirt to Order

1. NAME - XL
2. NAME - L
3. NAME - S

Answers for Activity

1. True
2. False
3. &#x200B;
4. True

Do you guys think Telegram should make a way for people to be able to send collaborative messages in group chats? One where everyone can edit the message?

But I would love it if a specialized system for collaborative lists could be made instead of a collaborative message.

If you have used Ultimate Pollbot in Telegram, my vision would be more specifically a collaborative list that looks like their poll system. Instead of a poll system where a user defines options for people to vote, it would be a list where people can add items the same way some polls like in Facebook allow for the addition of options. But this wouldn't be a poll. It is simply a list. Just so lists wouldn't look so cluttered. It would also be nice to have an ability to make a numbered list for collaborative activities so people can input items to specific numbers.

I guess people would say, why not just use an external option like collaborative spreadsheets? This is because such options are too much of a hassle. I believe, if polls in itself are a form of collaborative information sharing between people such in the Ultimate Pollbot I mentioned for Telegram that works very conveniently, I think the same could be done if they tried doing a collaborative list system.

I guess a third party bot developer can do this or it might exist already but I am not aware. I just really want a clean and sleek collaborative list and not the copying and pasting thing. People in Messenger do it all the time. Yes, this is also a plead to a third party bot developer to do this in case it is possible.

TL;DR I want a collaborative list system that is designed under the same principles as the poll system to make things convenient.";2020-12-26 03:54:19;
This is the most nitpick idea ever but I might not be the only one with this idea. Why not separate the Media tab into Picture and Video?;56;kk99jw;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kk99jw/this_is_the_most_nitpick_idea_ever_but_i_might/;8;I don't get why there are so many categories but pictures and videos are not separated. In fact, I think no one would even complain if they separated pictures and videos. It's a very nitpick idea that I would not criticize the app for not doing it but also at the same time, I think it's something they should consider. What do you guys think? Also, do you prefer putting pictures and videos in one tab just like how they do now?;2020-12-26 03:42:15;"That's how it was before. I think it's still like that on desktop. Telegram X on Android actually has individual tabs for ALL media types.

Photos, videos, animation (gifs), voice messages video messages, etc etc The only reason I could think of is that it might cause too many tabs, which would look cluttered, at least in designers' eyes. Especially since Desktop has that separation, because Desktop has a larger space to work with. It'd be awesome. I waste a lot of time searching old videos between 1000 photos I hate that if you send a photo, it compresses it. If you send the photo as a file, it doesn’t. . Exactly. Desktop has two separate tabs for videos and images."

If they access your account on your phone, yes. If you think you might be in legal trouble burn your account now so it's unreadable even with access to your phone. Yes. Telegram can read, meaning police can just ask telegram for your messages. 🤣 Nope. Not how any of this works at all. What's wrong in my original comment? All of it! You clearly don't understand how tg claims to have their servers and encryption setup. We have to trust them but the Russian incident gives them bit of credibility imo. They use some sort of multi sig setup where no one individual has access to any of your private chats and data. Any public groups you are in can be accessed by anyone but private groups and e2e chats can't be accessed by anyone other than the parties involved. If the OP is this concerned about security it would be wise to set the timeout on the account to as low as possible so that in the event something happens the account gets nuked quickly and everything is inaccessible. I have a much better understanding of how telegram works than you. 

What is wrong in what I have said in the original comment? Telegram can read all group chats and almost all personal chats. Don't use it for personal stuff. The police will ask telegram and telegram can just give it If you believe that they can see and read everything then you clearly have no idea how anything works. You also don't understand basic opsec or cyber security. If the encryption keys to our accounts were stored accessible to any one employee then Russia didn't need to threaten TG and block their servers, they could have hacked it or threatened employees until someone gave it up.

It would behoove you to learn more about encryption and multi sig setups before you go spouting this nonsense again. The original poster asked whether police can read. Not whether one specific employee will give the encryption keys.

Telegram is not decentralised. It's not federated. I suggest you read up stuff, before saying I'm wrong, that too so confidently. 


Can telegram access all messages without your permission?

Yes. Messages are stored on their servers.


Can police ask messages from telegram?

Will telegram give up messages?

just go to their profile and click “add to contacts”. now they’ll show up in your contacts section. Thanks. But after the last IOS update, it’s gotten set — probably for good reason — to not have access to my contacts. So I’d have to allow access in settings… not very private if you ask me, given stories of people who signed into TG on a friend’s phone and their contacts synced to that phone’s addressbook. One would think that a tool like this would have its own friends-book to manage your interactants, not force you/require you to surrender access to phone contacts if you want to add anyone on TG at all. Also, because it’s used by a lot of controversial rights bloggers, a lot of TG’s ethos celebrates anonymous culture — like the mask guy stickers/mascot — so one would think its design would uphold this. I wonder when it’s going to be fully decentralized. Now hear that Pavel, that’s a feature I would pay for.

Telegram > Discord My friends and i are now replacing Discord with this new feature, thank you, Telegram. Hope they will add noice reduction Where are the group voice chats? After they add group video calls Telegram will be better than WhatsApp in every possible way.

Group video chat when? 👀 I'm waiting for group video chats. Cries in shortcuts support I don't like that it shows at the top FOREVER,  and there is not a permission to give to those who are not admin to start the voice chat. Besides that it is a very good feature. At first I didn't understood how it would work but now I love it, although it appears that it's not encrypted as 1 on 1 calls. Ну всё,теперь можно юзать Телегу вместо Зума What would be better? Leave right away, but still give you the option of ending the voice chat? Actually yeah that would be better. Yeah. I think a MUCH better option would be to implement this as a permission for members and admins. ""Start voice chat"" and ""End voice chat"" - with the latter perhaps only being limited to admins or at the very least when there are no members currently in voice chat. 

If I were being greedy, I could also ask for specific users to be banned from it, so we can deal with abusers. Doesn’t happen on iOS. Add a suggestion for that. 

https://bugs.telegram.org/ Soon? I think it's already better!

Next year they'll introduce business features... then it will also be Telegram > Slack Honestly I don't see Telegram competing for the same market that Discord and Slack are. Sure there's a lot of overlap but I find they're different enough to be useful under different circumstances. it's in the todo list afaik, just a little patience What OS do you use? It's not shows forever! You should end the chat to close that.
Tap on three dots on up left corner to end chat. для онлайн уроков Yeah, in the voice chat screen there is already the option to terminate in the three dot menu.

Or maybe it could ask the first time on the prompt, but then they could implement a checkbox for ""never terminate the chat on exit"" or something similar. Still not better untill they add channels on groups and reactions. I can't find it on android I mean if you want to let the users join at any time, there is no way to keep it active and not showing, since only admins can start voice chat thats the way I found to let normal users chat between them at any time. Another improvement I would suggest is enabling anyone to create a voice chat in small groups (with the option for admins to disable this). It would be nice to have more spontaneous voice chats. Absolutely agree that we need reactions, also inline emotes like Twitch. You need to be admin of the group to start the group call. Should work on android and desktop. Tap on group’s name, tap on 3 dots and tap on start voice chat Yeah you're right. You don't really need that. Small groups everyone is an admin, or the admin can just leave it open. I have many small groups where the admin is not really around anymore or in some cases has left entirely so we can't start a voice chat at all.

>or the admin can just leave it open.

Opening a voice chat sends a notification to the group members which is handy. Why not just start a new group and archive the old? Voice chats aren't so important that we would go to that effort.

But this is an edge case. I still think non admins should be able to start it."

https://telegram.org/blog/calls

I'm gonna say, yes. What we currently know:

1. Saved messages, personal chats, groups and channels use MTProto encryption in cloud mode.
2. Secret chats, voice calls and video calls use MTProto encryption in secret mode (E2E).
3. It's not yet clear what kind of encryption is used in group voice chats. Telegram MTProto has two kind of encryption:

1) e2e: used in secret chat, voice and video calls 1:1.

2) client/server or cloud: used in group chat, channel and voice group calls.

You can read more information here How really secure and private is Telegram (look on How-really-secure-and-private-is-Telegram-09-02 on telegra dot ph, reddit blocks it). Thanks, I'm not tech-savy, I really have no idea or previous knowledge about this being encrypted.

Thanks again 👍 Voice chats are not e2e encrypted though. They are as secure as normal text messages, but not as 1-to-1 calls > It's not yet clear what kind of encryption is used in group voice chats.

finally, someone paying attention to the question > It's not yet clear what kind of encryption is used in group voice chats.

They are not e2e encrypted, they are ""as encrypted as"" cloud chats Well, judging Pavel durov's stance on privacy I'd really doubt he'd implement anything without at least some layer of encryption"

NSFW Warning / Notice;84;kjgw9n;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kjgw9n/nsfw_warning_notice/;19;"I would be delighted if there was a feature on Telegram that you could turn on to be warned / alerted when you first enter a group / channel that there might be NSFW content there.

Great idea In my opinion this is something that should be managed by the community itself, unless it's a ""mark as NSFW"" feature, something like /u/Herolias suggests.

Realistically, this already exists to an extent as NSFW group/channel content is inaccessible on iOS devices until enabled from a non-iOS device due to Apple restrictions. I support this.

You can post your suggestion on the new bug reporting/suggestion forum by telegram [here](https://bugs.telegram.org/). Someone makes it clear for me please, is NSFW (porn) allowed on Telegram at all? A spoiler feature like the one on discord would be nice There are many DIY solutions for this problem, chiefly bots. (Welcome bots, message hiding bots)

Also multiple groups, one called SFW and another one NSFW, for example.

Not saying it wouldn't be cool to have some innate solutions, but it can already be done with some effort. Why is it that some channels/groups get deleted ""because they were used to spread pornography"" that are not accessible even on Android or Desktop? Thank you! It is allowed on Telegram. It's not allowed on iPhone. This means some groups and channels are not accessible on the iPhone version. I think you can report messages bc of Porn content. But what my idea is for, is to make this not neccessary, so u can ""accept"" the fact there could be porn content or just say ""no, don't wanna see this, I'm not joining this group"" It isn't allowed if you're using Indonesian phone number, Iranian phone number and Apple products. Other than that it's allowed Yeeah I already heard about this bot... it's cool... just wanted to be able to do this with a single click on the ""NSFW ON/OFF"" button :D There was a bug a while back which made groups appear this way: https://mobile.twitter.com/telegram/status/1000868059580698624, but otherwise that shouldn't happen It's not allowed on Telegram either. That ""report pornography"" is there regardless of the OS. It is allowed. However, you need to turn it on for yourself (at least if you have an iOS device). The only restriction is illegal pornography. https://telegram.org/tos What is illegal pornography though? Copyrighted? I would guess child porn and revenge porn Child porn, rape, etc"

Can I prevent the eventual new owner of my old phone number from ever using Telegram with it by enabling 2FA?;3;kj6op3;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kj6op3/can_i_prevent_the_eventual_new_owner_of_my_old/;15;"When I signed up for Telegram, I used a phone number that I currently no longer use because I moved to another country and got a new local number. However, I did not want to update my Telegram account with my new local number and deliberately kept it linked to my old number from the previous country I lived in. 

Years have passed and my Telegram account is still linked to my old phone number which again is a choice I deliberately made.  My old number got discontinued within 6 months after I moved to a new country.  To my total surprise though,  it has yet to be re-assigned to a new owner all these years later.

Nevertheless, I have little doubt that that will eventually happen. As a result I am reluctantly considering updating my Telegram account to my new number, to prevent a situation where the new owner of my older number starts using Telegram, and appropriates my account and all my data. 

Be that as it may, I recently found out that Telegram has a *two factor authentication* feature (2FA), which would prevent anyone from enabling the app with my account on a new device, without a secret passphrase that I would create. 

In theory that suggests that I could still use my old number with Telegram, even if it gets re-assigned to a new owner, because they would never be able to sign up to Telegram with that number, even if they own it. 

Am I correct in believing this or are there flaws in my logic? 

Would it be wise to proceed with this method? 

Please let me know.";2020-12-24 05:17:19;"they can reset the account, which will delete your account and they’ll be able to make a new one To own the Telegram account, you need to own the number.

This is indeed a very interesting situation. It's also possible that your old number has now been destroyed, and will no longer be used.

I can't speak from experience because when I got a new number, I immediately changed it on Telegram as well. I kind of wish I just kept it to see what would happen haha.

Sorry this doesn't help much, but it does seem like the new owner wouldn't be able to create a new Telegram account as long as you're using that number. hmm, as long as the password is exceptionally strong I guess that number could be protected for a very long time

however you have to act fast and sign up for a new account with your old number, then set up the whole thing Are you sure they can do that? If I have 2FA on? Someone suggested that the new owner of the number could reset the account even if they are unable to access it because I enable 2FA. At which point all my data will be deleted and would create a new account with that number. If that's true then it's probably better than I upgrade my account to my new number. I would like confirmation though. That doesn't answer my question. I use strong passprases all the time so that shouldn't be a problem. However, I mention in a previous reply, someone suggested that the new owner of the number could still reset the account even if they are unable to access it because I enable 2FA. At which point all my data will be deleted and would create a new account with that number. If that's true then it's probably better than I upgrade my account to my new number. I would like confirmation though. you can only reset an account if it has 2FA on. it’s to prevent people from squatting accounts on phone numbers they no longer own, as Telegram considers the owner of the phone number the owner of the account (see their FAQ for more info). 

so i recommend just buying a cheap prepaid or VoIP number, transfer the account to that number, and keeping it indefinitely Yes, if you want to keep your account you need to change your # if it changes. I might just do that. Thanks for confirming that I wouldn't be able to protect my account with 2FA. Where can one buy a VoIP number? Is it a recurring fee, or can just pay once and own the number forever? As long as you have ownership of that # you can protect your account. What you can't do is squat on an account and prevent others from using it if/when they control that #.

As was already said, get a cheap # from tmo or att prepaid or get a # from Google voice or another voip service where you can own the # for life. I would suggest voice because it's free. Plus assuming you have other accounts with Google it can be protected behind the same 2fa instead of keeping track of another service. Squat an account? To be clear the Telegram account is mine. No one else's. A Telegram account and a phone number are two separate things. Moreover, Google Voice is only available in the US and  I am not in the US. You didn't read or understand what someone else already said about this.

Telegram associates accounts with phone #s, he who owns the number owns the account. If you don't want to risk losing your account change your # asap. Do you not have a cell phone you can use? Gvoice won't work but I bet your country has plenty of cheap cell plans that would and there are plenty of burner services that will give you a #. Yes you are correct. I guess I will update to my new number before my old one gets reassigned."

Telegram: Give it 30-40 years. Boom! 

Roasted Like it when Durov and his team troll WhatsApp. And in fact, they are right. Not sure if sucking this much is WhatsApp's choice or decision... Meanwhile, I am under the impression that Telegram is becoming more bloated with every update. Anybody else thinks the same? They are not implemented because the cloud would not work with those Every time I read these statement I'm annoyed, because it shows a lack of understanding how the tech they promote/request works.
Also, yes E2E is nice... But that not much better than the current situation. 

A core feature, on which everything is build in Telegram, is that it syncs with all your devices. The way it does this, it synchronizes with a central server, which processes all messages. The connections with that server are encrypted. We don't know what happens on that server - that's where you have to trust them (like with your mail provider, etc...). I'm pretty sure that they use hard drive encryption, and also other standard security measures, given their security dedication. 

Tldr: you talk encrypted with the server.

WhatsApp does this radically different. Their server is only there, to tell you, where to send your messages to. So instead of connecting to a server, you directly establish an encrypted connection to the other phone. Yes, it cuts the main server. But it also cuts all the features the server can offer.

Tldr: the server says who to talk to encrypted.

You usually can have a or b. But both is incredibly difficult and can lead to many small and big issues. And also quite some limitations.

Given the current situation, know what you want and use the correct tool. But don't ask a wrench to be a fork. Also, using E2EE by default No, it isn't bloated, as those features are very usefull Yes and the last announcement by durov is worrying I think telegram should just implement it and let users decide whether they want encrypted chats or web backup. It's possible. Look at Keybase. Key exchange / provisioning is a solved problem. >But that not much better than the current situation.

Except it is. If Telegram servers are hacked, data of 500 million people are compromised. If Signal user's device is hacked, data of that user is compromised.

>is that it syncs with all your devices.

Every time I read this claim it makes me sad. Signal syncs all messages across all devices you have, and unlike with e.g. WhatsApp, your phone doesn't have to be powered on so you can use the desktop client.

>it synchronizes with a central server

Telegram could trivially synchronize client-side encrypted data with the server. This is no excuse.

>We don't know what happens on that server - that's where you have to trust them

You also have to trust no one ever hacks them. Because if they do, all that data leaks out. But hey, it's not like there's another cyber attack every other day.

>I'm pretty sure that they use hard drive encryption

Disk encryption only protects in this case: Someone walks into the data center, and takes out a hard drive from the NAS rack, and walks out.

All hard drive encryption is something called On-The-Fly-Encryption (OTFE). My desktop computer uses such full-disk-encryption. If I establish an SFTP connection over SSH to my desktop computer, I can read any file on the computer. If I manage to escalate privileges on the system, I can trivially access the RAM and steal and database encryption key Telegram server would use. I could then use this key to decrypt the SQL databases used by the Telegram server.

>given their security dedication.

What dedication would that be? The cryptographers they hired to design the protocol. Oh that was the brother of the CEO who has PhD in geometry, not cryptography. Would you hire a gynecologist to do the job of a brain surgeon? Or the audit they performed. Oh right :D that never happened. I only see excuses like ""only niche products use E2EE"" (what even is WhatsApp), and misdirection ""sync requires no E2EE"" (not the case as already proven by Signal).

>Tldr: you talk encrypted with the server.

tl:dr; client-server-encryption only matters when the intended destination is the server, e.g. when browsing wikipedia, or doing online shopping/banking. With secure messaging even the server is considered a third party. I mean gees, privacy geeks have been solving this problem since Zimmermann wrote PGP in 1991 :D End-to-end encryption has existed 4 years longer than client-server encryption.

>WhatsApp

WhatsApp isn't comparable to Signal, let's keep shitty apps out of this discussion :)

>But both is incredibly difficult and can lead to many small and big issues. And also quite some limitations.

The only fundamental architectural limitations that exist are E2EE massive channels and massive super-groups, neither of which have expectation of privacy. And even in that case the blocks come simply from performance side: a problem that diminishes as phones get faster.

>Given the current situation, know what you want and use the correct tool. But don't ask a wrench to be a fork.

My problem is Telegram advertises itself to be ""heavily encrypted"" and ""secure from hackers"", neither of which is the case as evident from protocol and common sense. For all I care, Telegram can be unencrypted, as long as they're **upfront** and honest about it.

So the problem is Telegram doesn't bother correcting people making false assumptions about its security. well at least he isn't resorting to straight out ads. I really don't mind if Telegram is moving to paid service as long as it's not too expensive. I didn't mind when WhatsApp was paid before it was acquired by Facebook (back then the price was IDR 12 per year iinm), but now they're looking to put ads on it. I use Telegram daily and I love it. They do? They're secret chats and work precisely as you described. >I think telegram should just implement it and let users decide whether they want encrypted chats or web backup.

One user picks having web backup, purpose of group chat encryption is defeated? For group chats... Let admins decide whether they want their group encrypted or not. Ah yeah sorry"

Telegram is not on its word.😕 Better it would ask for donations. Many are ready to donate .;1;kitklg;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/1s62tf4n0y661.jpg;24;;2020-12-23 16:59:53;"Tbh the ad platform for Channels is a fine idea, it can benefit both telegram and channel creators (rather than being one sided like donations), also from what I could gather it's only for Channels who wish to advertise content, they aren't going to shove ads in the middle of channels for no reason

Although i do agree that a donation option would be nice to have as well, although I'm not sure as to how many would be willing to donate at a sustainable rate 

Tbh, if anyone hates the new ad platform i definitely understand your concerns, I'm worried myself as to how this will turn out, for now all I can do I wait and see what happens I honestly saw this coming a million miles away.

Telegram is providing excellent service to everyone, with 2GB file transfers and unlimited cloud service that EVERY Telegram user is getting for FREE.

Pavel Durov is extremely generous but he’s no Mark Zoidberg or Jeff Pesos in terms of wealth. Funds will run out sooner or later and with no sustainable income from Telegram Messenger, they will be required to think of some way to monetize the app to sustain it, not profit from it.

This is just another wikipedia scenario in which I hope somewhere in the future, I won’t see Pavel Durov begging everyone to donate $3.00 just for the app to exist. Sad Truth : Most open source projects run by just donations die. How the hell do you think they can pay for so many users now? Telegram is getting bigger and they need money now to run the servers What happend ?? I don't know what adds they gonna show on channels and how will they be relevant to the users ? What about yearly subscription?!, there would be no mess! 
Though there are few demerits which include decline in new users..& more.
But keeping simple is the telegram way..! This is making lots of confusion among telegram users How does wikipedia keep running though? I guess it's just that most projects don't have enough demand, so there are not enough donations. Yes it now have 500 M user Nothing yet.

The founder opened up about plans on how to monetize Telegram. He can't pay for all the expenses himself forever, you know?

The plan is to maybe add (important: add, not remove and sell) paid features for businesses and allow public channels to show ads through a dedicated ad platform which will then of course provide a steady income for Telegram in form of a small cut of the profit.

I think it's smart. A lot of channels seem to use the regular messaging features to post ads already anyway, so a dedicated platform sounds like a nice feature not only for channels but also for big groups and maybe even bots.

Regular folk like you and me will probably not see any ads at all (I'm not subscribed to any big public group or channel and the app itself and especially anything private will never show any ad) and even for those people who do browse public chats and channels I'm sure it's much cleaner to have a dedicated ""ad"" message than ads disguised as regular messages.

We have to realize that Telegram isn't just a messenger anymore. It's almost a full blown social network with many features. As I've said, it seems that will be up to channel owners and won't be like website ads (in which they track the user's preferences)

Considering how Telegram said the ad platform will respect privacy I don't see how they could deliver personalized ads They get plenty of donation. But they still put popup for donations every year. Yes, I strongly agree with you that Telegram has become an integrated community But why he not launch a massive fundraising campaign? I am sure that there are people who will donate strongly, I am sure Will this affect ordinary people like you and me, or on channels that are not primarily affiliated with companies or institutions, but rather ordinary people? Agreed. Seems impossible to get personalized adds they may give adds related to channel topic ex: tech channel get tech adds , 

Here, comes the benefit, all pirated channels get into light in the name of adds & get deleted  :) because long term solution is better than asking for funding each year or two, built-in solutions will also scale with users growth, while funds from 1-time campaigns can end faster than expected if surge of new users happen. Look on Wikipedia, ppl are already fedup and meming about their popups asking for donations. As I understand it there won't be ads randomly placed by Telegram itself. I think channel owners will be able to decide for themselves if and how they want to include ads, but it's too early to tell and he was pretty vaque in that regard. Good point. Aha Do you mean that there may be an application for channels that want to place ads? I use Telegram FOSS 
It can affect on all Telegram copies Maybe the ""official"" FOSS client will, but there will most certainly be clients which will have disabled ads.

That's the power of FOSS, right? Yes, this is power
And dont forget it have more privacy then the official 
The FOSS remove all Google's privacy-violating software that tracks you"

Telegram launches a new platform to report bugs and suggest features;41;kip31v;Telegram;http://bugs.telegram.org;8;;2020-12-23 11:04:12;"Glad to see that reactions are at #1. I find it amazing that they aren't already in the app and that they're prioritizing much more complicated but less useful features like the new voice channels. Obviously I commend them on implementing those features, but I think they could take a week or two and implement them, which makes me think that there is some other reason that they don't want to add them. Hopefully seeing them at the top of the most wanted features puts them high up on the priority list for future updates. Uh... Do you need to do something to be able to post? I don't see an option to do so. Let's vote for end-to-end encryption for non-supergroups! Let's vote for message reactions When I try to login I get server error. Anyone else? Never mind. I guess not everyone has them

[https://bugs.telegram.org/c/725](https://bugs.telegram.org/c/725) I thought there was already e2e encryption. It's not your fault for being mistaken that Telegram's group chats are end-to-end encrypted. Considering the developers call both the end-to-end encrypted secret chat protocol and the non-end-to-end encrypted client-server encryption ""MTProto"", they're not really keen to correct everyone that all communication is secure. It's not even ruled out this is intentional misleading, it's that egregious practice."
Telegram is going to monetize in some way;210;kip219;Telegram;https://telegram.dog/durov/142;108;;2020-12-23 11:02:01;"This seems reasonable and necessary, as long as they don't start collecting data from chats and sell/use it for ads. Honestly, the only thing I could be truly pissed off about here is if one of these paid features they introduce is something I want. But having ads in channels that already serve ads is, eh, alright and as long as it keeps the app itself free and available to everyone, I don't mind.

Personally, I'd shell out a couple of bucks a year to use Telegram but I know for a fact that many people outside the US don't have disposable income to waste on apps so this is a better move than making it paid, at least for now. He clearly said that they are going to stick with the values they've been adhering to for the last 7-8 years. So, it will. Men like Durov know what trust is. He breaks those vows, entire Telegram population will turn against him. Doesn't look bad at all, but I'm skeptical, when things like that happen things have changed for the worse. I wish they had moved ahead with crypto

On that note, they should find some way to support money transfers like cashapp and take a small percentage of the transfer. Reddit and Discord have their ways to make some revenues, but they're still two very enjoyable platforms.

I think telegram will manage to do the same thing I'd gladly pay for enhanced features, or just donate. Telegram is so much better than all it's predecessors. This is quite interesting.

I've been thinking about Telegram's long-term sustainability lately, given their growth. That whole ""Durov's paying for it"" thing sounded increasingly worrying for a platform with 500 million users, so I was hoping they would eventually communicate a clear plan to monetise it.

The reason I find it interesting is because other messaging apps (e.g.: WhatsApp) don't really have an equivalent for channels as far as I know. They have business profiles, but I've always been skeptical of how much money they can actually make off that (if they charge too much, I assume most businesses will just resort to talking to their customers through regular, one-to-one chats).

With Telegram's channels though, it's a different story. Some of those channels have like half a million users, and many of them are already oriented to commercial offers and deals... so showing, say, 1 ""sponsored"" ad every 10 actual messages doesn't sound intrusive at all for the customer.

If they can make Telegram profitable just by showing those ads, I think it would be great news. It basically means the social / mass-media part of Telegram can pay for the actual messaging platform, while having like 1/10th of the users WhatsApp has. And as far as I know, WhatsApp still doesn't have a clear way to be profitable/sustainable today.

Good stuff, eager to see how it turns out. Seems like free cloud storage will end soon. When are they going to accept donations? I honestly wouldn’t mind paying for premium features or subscribing to it to support the app.

Hell, I’ve used Telegram Messenger for almost 7 years FOR FREE without intrusing advertisements and exceptional features, it’s high time I give back to it and support the platform that I love and continue using.

As long as they retain their goals and vision for why they started Telegram in the first place and don’t follow WhatsApp or other apps that sold themselves out. I just read Durovs channel. Can't he say how exactly he plans to cover the costs? He's so vague, leaves me a bit worried I don't mind the idea of paying for Telegram. I would much rather pay cash than have my data mined. Services don't host themselves for free, so I'm happy to kick in.

Being completely honest, a decision to charge will make me take a look at other services like Threema. I don't use channels or groups (haven't found anything interesting, seems like everything is fanboys screaming over what cryptocurrency is best or whatever) so for me it's just an independent messaging app. But with Telegram's maturity and stability, I honestly don't see myself leaving anytime soon.

EDIT: Just in case I was missing something, I decided to look into channels again. I searched for ""cooking"" and found exactly three. One isn't in my language, one is just pictures of cake, and one is just audio. I would paid for end to end encryption for all chat Bandwidth is fucking expensive nowdays. How has Telegram been funded so far? And they've made no revenue at all in all these years? I honestly wouldn't mind paying for a pro service giving the features telegram has over it's other competitors. It'll be interesting to see the steps they take but given the past few years I think they are gonna take an approach that will be good for the community. 

I think Durov knows that any major changes in how they fund Telegram would result in a huge shift in the user base and would result in the loyal fan base leaving en masse. At the same time however I know it's unfeasable for a free service to offer as many features as they do indefinitely. It'll be interesting to see how it pans out. I'm started to think that using the old WhatsApp scheme will be enough to cover all costs and it's not expensive for most users ($0.99/year) Business enhanced features is a great choice, i can see they can target Slack and Microsoft Teams users. Not a fan of the idea of paid stickers. Stickers have always been all free. 

I wish they'd open donations or a merch store. I'd happily support Telegram by buying a hoodie, shirt or mug to show off my love for this app! I’d donate money from my pockets if they are thinking about selling my data RIP Privacy on Telegram Telegram slowly turning into WhatsApp. Doubt. Another reason why groupchats should be end-to-end encrypted like on Signal, iMessage and even WhatsApp. > reasonable and necessary, as long as they don't start collecting data 

Here is a scenario.

1. a car maker  pays Telegram to place ads in channels
2. the car maker notices that everyone talks shit about their cars despite the ads
3. the car maker tells telegram to ""shadow ban"" the bad posts or threaten to pull the ads
4.  Telegram complies in order to keep the revenue 

something like this happens ALL THE TIME on all sorts of platforms.  Advertisers hold these companies hostage.  On top of that everyone HATES ads

this is a BIG mistake.. 
they could make a premium version of the app and also accept donations.

Fuck the advertising The golden rule is, if you're not paying, you're the product.

There are exceptions in messaging world like Signal, but Telegram? We'll see. They already collect 100% metadata from all chats and 100% of content of non-secret chats which happens to include all group chats. We can only pray they will never sell that data, or that whoever owns Telegram 10 or 20 years from now, never does that. >But having ads in channels that already serve ads is, eh, alright and as long as it keeps the app itself free and available to everyone, I don't mind.

I bet they wouldn't allow for both types side-by-side. Hm.. And I'd liked even donation option, to support them somehow. Just can't do it now. They csn open donation They must do it, it is not possible to go this way anymore. They can sell it or monetize it in a reasonable way. They couldn't move ahead with crypto because the US threatened them to ban them Whole crypto world is a fraud > I wish they had moved ahead with crypto

I think I'm out of the loop. What do you mean by that? Were they going to profit by mining cryptocurrencies with users' CPUs? (I wouldn't mind that. Just asking) [deleted] I think reddit ads is fine because it isn't invasive like EVERY other social media and discord is just moving emotes and personally i basically almost never use emotes on discord agree on the first part, self funding of app becoming that big was getting me worried that they will sooner or later be forced to do something shady, but they are completely transparent on their plans and im more than happy with what is currently said. Honestly I would bear spammy DMs of any sort in order to keep that up. the most valuable part of telegram is unlimited cloud storage...... if they end that I'd go back to google drive again... So why don't you donate directly and dont encourage them to make subscription and battle pass What do you mean? He said ads in channels and new paid features, for example for businesses. It's not that vague. One example is described quite straightforward:

>6. In addition to its messaging component, Telegram has a social networking dimension. Our massive public one-to-many channels can have millions of subscribers each and are more like Twitter feeds. In many markets the owners of such channels display ads to earn money, sometimes using third-party ad platforms. The ads they post look like regular messages, and are often intrusive. We will fix this by introducing our own Ad Platform for public one-to-many channels – one that is user-friendly, respects privacy and allows us to cover the costs of servers and traffic.

i.e. AdSense within Telegram. So channel owners that seek to monetize their audience could go to platform provided by telegram instead of having to find/deal with sponsors/advertisers themselves. Telegram gets cut off every transaction, channel owners get safety/ease of finding suitable advertisers.

note: those ads are not banners of some kind, but supposedly just usual post/message with endorsement/integrations. Just like Youtubers do when they make deals directly with advertisers. im guessing these are long term plans for monetization, with no details nor  implementation yet ready so we can expect more to come. Nothing to worry about imo. > I don't mind the idea of paying for Telegram. I would much rather pay cash than have my data mined. Services don't host themselves for free, so I'm happy to kick in.

Me neither... A couple of bucks/year wouldn't kill me. I'm nowhere near as knowledgeable as others here, but I would be supportive of paid ""premium"" features (ie. more storage in particular for those using this as a file repository) if it meant the basic messaging stayed free. I can't use what my contacts don't use, so any friction at all and they simply revert to SMS.

&#x200B;

As for ads in channels, one of my issues is that the only channels I ever see are gambling or crypto-currency.   Having real sponsored channels seems like a good way to get some traction (in my area anyways) for real ""legit"" businesses that have ads/services I might actually use.  Things like legit news sites, local radio stations, etc that use it as a ""twitter-like"" feed with local ads seems like something I would find of interest, especially as I don't want to use FB. And lose sync? No thanks... But you can start a secret chat right now for free Use secret chats to get it Durov has a massive pile of cash he's used out of the kindness of his heart Proof? How do you propose they keep telegram running? How so? That would be nice but then we lose true cloud sync. What I meant is that WhatsApp may be E2E encrypted but for sure Facebook is collecting other data to turn a profit. I just hope that Telegram is not doing anything similar. Yes, one thousand times yes Except WhatsApp and iMessage aren’t open source so they’re not e2ee like signal. A big media corporation gives telegram a shitload of money. This corporation “discovers” that there are groups generously sharing copyrighted content and tells the owner about it. 

The enterprise telegram complies so as to keep the sweet sweet dollars. 

Use Signal Who's paying for Signal? Why is it an exception? You can pray or you can stop using it, as I had to do

Edit: use signal, E2EE by default and still undefeated You mean I won't see five paragraphs of text advertising some guy's crypto betting channel anymore? I'd be fine with that, lol. Oh ya I know why, it just sucks =) Yeah the only way it would generate revenue is by pumping up the token price and then selling it to people hoping it will go up further. That's not what was meant (they built a cryptocurrency but the US wouldn't let them use it) but seems like a good idea to keep the platform free. What I meant is that reddit coins and Nitro give the two platform some revenues without changing the users' experience.

Telegram could start with something like that. You might wanna check out Proton Drive sometime in future (it's in closed beta now I think)

If I understood it right then it's supposed to be like Google Drive but privacy respecting We don’t know the kind of feature or payment plan they have yet and right now, as far as I know, there isn’t a direct way to donate to Telegram Messenger. >ads in channels

No, he said chanel owners are already posting ads using third party platforms which looks like messages. Telegram'll provide its own platform for those ads. So ads in a channel depends on the owners of the channel and basically nothing changes for the user apart from now they can now easily tell between content and ad. Ig we just have different definitions of vague Ads in channel, just like WhatsApp we loved to criticize right ?
Don't get me wrong I just read Durov's post and that totally makes sense, in the mean time I have a feeling that WhatsApp got a backlash for that while Telegram is seemingly paving it's way for the same thing.

Edit : thanks for your answers and clarifications. And this a good thing with all the shit going down with Youtube. 

Gives these people more control and not at the whims of Youtube or Advertisers. Can totally see Telegram being another alternative to YouTube. Yeah, I can stomach all of that if it means that the channels are:

(1) searchable and easy to find, and 

(2) not just gaming / porn / crypto / warez

Telegram is great for 1:1 messaging and video calling but it has zero value for me for anything else. Apple has group e2e-encryption with sync, so that’s completely possible Wow, that's truly incredible. They shouldn't have spent their time criticizing WhatsApp when they're just becoming like them. E2E - you can still collect key words client side, though. Lie, what about keybase??? That’s true. WhatsApp’s alleged E2EE must be a lie, because they collect a shitton of private data whereas Signal collects almost nothing at all > aren’t open source so they’re not e2ee like signal.

The most idiotic thing I read today. Being open source or closed source does not affect their E2EE or not. I am not gonna answer small question which can be found by reading Signal's FAQ. Or we users can spread the word and ask the developers to take our privacy seriously. Why? You’re looking at crypto as an asset (as is many speculators, so I’m not arguing it’s a wrong position to take). 

Aside from the ICO, I believe telegram was looking at crypto as a means of exchange - the same thing banks are looking at. 

If a distributed ledger position is held for 0.1s (to send value to another person) fluctuations and current rate matters far less. > the US wouldn't let them use it

Any reason why? Telegram's ads platform is going to be paid for the advertisers, as any other ads platform, and Telegram is going to keep a share of the price. So yes, ads I get where you're coming from but it's not going to be like WhatsApp because WhatsApp announced plans to put ads all over the app, including Statuses and the menus. Channels already have ads though, so it's not like this will change anything but their format. I'm also a bit more lenient toward Telegram since it's not supported by a company that makes literal millions every minute every day. \> Ads in channel, just like WhatsApp we loved to criticize right ? 

Not sure what you mean? Telegram doesn't prohibit posting ads in **your own** channel -- shitton of channels have been doing that for years (I'd bet most with few asterisks). 

They're just going to ""legalize"" it by becoming middle man so owners don't have to deal with advertisers directly (no scams/unpaid money, more ads to pick from, etc). Adding to what other commenters said, WhatsApp is made to collect your personal data in order to display tailored ads. We hope that when Durov says ""privacy respecting"" he's not going to do that.

Also, I hope that the user experience will get better. Channels that post ads are annoying, giving false notifications and bloating the whole channel screen. Maybe ads will get a little bit less intrusive. Hmmm ... do you have a source for that? I would to know if that’s true. It's not exactly how it's going to work according to Durov's latest post on his own channel. Channels have already been broadcasting ads via third-party platforms. Telegram's intention is to eliminate those platforms and provide the platform itself and get shares from those ads. No ads will be displayed within group and private chats and no existing feature will turn paid. Only some extra paid features will be developped for businesses and power users. Bought by Zoom, so defeated This is the most idiotic thing I've read. If an application is open source it proves that is open source and the owner isn't claiming it is. Right in the FAQ:

> Amazon will donate .5% of your purchases to Signal.

i.e., sponsored by IT giant. How is this more independent than Telegram? If they don’t know this already from the billions of e-mails they intercept, they are very bad at spying the people they use. I was looking forward to using the feature, that's all :) But they could do that already by supporting bitcoin and other cryptos. They aren't even talking about that though. I doubt it would generate much profit. I don't know the reasons but I am guessing paranoia and lack of control. I found a page explicitly stating that it also applied to group texts but can’t seem to find it now. [Here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209110) they mention that it applies to all messages. And because telegram owns the medium, they can make these ads both more relevant, more rich and less obtrusive. Yes... so? The point is that it's possible to have E2EE and cloud sync. They just lie to themself to feel better about the lack of default encryption in all Telegram chats. Stop talking, you just look stupid. Did you actually read it? You can choose to direct your Amazon Smile donation to Signal, which is a non profit organization that you can donate to (you can use Smile to do this for many other non profits). It's in no way tied to Amazon. They are not spying on anyone Are you sure you replied to the correct message? If, please elaborate what e-mail intercepts have to do with asking Telegram developers to fix shitty security protocol. I think “when they are in transit between devices” is the key addition to the sentence Apple has carefully constructed for multiple interpretations:

>	We designed iMessage and FaceTime to use end-to-end encryption, so there’s no way for Apple to decrypt the content of your conversations when they are in transit between devices

In the follow-on sentence Apple commits only to encrypted attachments. No where does it say apple cannot read your text messages:

>	We designed iMessage and FaceTime to use end-to-end encryption, so there’s no way for Apple to decrypt the content of your conversations when they are in transit between devices Stop breathing, you're wasting oxygen. I believe you posted the wrong quote in your second paragraph.
However I believe you are being a bit too conspiratorial in the first paragraph. I think that‘s just specifying what actually is encrypted. It isn‘t extremely secure on your device, since anyone with your four digit passcode can access the data.
As some blog post pointed out, a legitimate criticism is the iCloud-Backup feature, where they can definitely access your data. It is completely optional though if you want to include iMessage in the backup.

EDIT: I was just using Apple as an example that it is possible in group chats. No u ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) u first m8."
Durov's thoughts about Telegram's growth. 500 million active users.;17;kip0j1;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kip0j1/durovs_thoughts_about_telegrams_growth_500/;13;"As Telegram approaches 500 million active users, many of you are asking the question – who is going to pay to support this growth? After all, more users mean more expenses for traffic and servers. A project of our size needs at least a few hundred million dollars per year to keep going. 

For most of Telegram’s history, I paid for the expenses of the company from my personal savings. However, with its current growth Telegram is on track to reach billions of users and to require appropriate funding. When a tech project reaches this scale, typically there are two options – start earning money to cover the costs, or sell the company. 

Hence the question – which path will Telegram take? I’d like to make a few points to clarify our plan:

1. We are not going to sell the company like the founders of Whatsapp. The world needs Telegram to stay independent as a place where users are respected and high-quality service is ensured. Telegram must continue to serve the world as an example of a tech company that strives for perfection and integrity. And, as the sad examples of our predecessors show, that is impossible if you become part of a corporation.

2. Telegram is here to stay for a long time. We began developing our apps for our personal use over 8 years ago and have come a long way since then. In the process, Telegram changed the way people communicate in several aspects – encryption, functionality, simplicity, design, speed. This journey has just started. There’s much more we can – and will – bring to the world. 

3. In order to make points 1 and 2 possible, Telegram will begin to generate revenue, starting next year. We will do it in accordance with our values and the pledges we have made over the last 7 years. Thanks to our current scale, we will be able to do it in a non-intrusive way. Most users will hardly notice any change.

4. All the features that are currently free will stay free. We will add some new features for business teams or power users. Some of these features will require more resources and will be paid for by these premium users. Regular users will be able to keep enjoying Telegram – for free, forever. 

5. All parts of Telegram devoted to messaging will remain ad-free. We think that displaying ads in private 1-to-1 chats or group chats is a bad idea. Communication between people should be free of advertising of any sort. 

6. In addition to its messaging component, Telegram has a social networking dimension. Our massive public one-to-many channels can have millions of subscribers each and are more like Twitter feeds. In many markets the owners of such channels display ads to earn money, sometimes using third-party ad platforms. The ads they post look like regular messages, and are often intrusive. We will fix this by introducing our own Ad Platform for public one-to-many channels – one that is user-friendly, respects privacy and allows us to cover the costs of servers and traffic.

7. If Telegram starts earning money, the community should also benefit. For example, If we monetize large public one-to-many channels via the Ad Platform, the owners of these channels will receive free traffic in proportion to their size. Or, if Telegram introduces premium stickers with additional expressive features, the artists who make stickers of this new type will also get a part of the profit. We want millions of Telegram-based creators and small businesses to thrive, enriching the experience of all our users.

This is the Telegram way.

It will allow us to keep innovating and keep growing for decades to come. We will be able to launch countless new features and welcome billions of new users. While doing that, we will remain independent and stay true to our values, redefining how a tech company should operate.";2020-12-23 10:58:51;"Screenshots:

https://imgur.com/w6M6jTw Would rather want an option to donate to fund Telegram tbh, I don't mind giving a few dollars a month for it if other users can still use for free (e.g. family). Should be similar funding as Wikipedia. >If Telegram starts earning money, the community should also benefit.

Can the community finally get end-to-end encryption for group chats and maybe a security audit so that we don't have to be embarrassed every time someone mentions Signal? 500 million people don't feel embarrassed. > so that we don't have to be embarrassed every time someone mentions Signal?

lol

I think Telegram is totally uninterested in adding that, so I think you shouldn't get your hopes too high With e2e group chats users would lose cloud sync [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum\_ad\_populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)

Are you saying 500 million people have given their informed consent to Durov collecting 100% of their metadata and 100% of group chat content? Every single peer I've discussed have thought Telegram is as secure as Signal, and my peers are mostly fellow students majoring in computer science. It's really embarrassing I have to explain to every peer Signal is made from completely different stuff.

Also why exactly doesn't Telegram fix their security issues? Don't they realize its an undisputable fact had Telegram servers been managed with SolarWinds' Orion, 100% of Telegram group messages would now be in the hands of the Russians. So much for the dissidents they're trying to protect. Data is a toxic asset [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/03/data\_is\_a\_toxic.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/03/data_is_a_toxic.html)

And Telegram's security strategy is evidentily summarized by [this book](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/03/79/09/037909b8d5ab36df7226228a5e6eaf51--o-reilly-software-development.jpg) So it sounds like they don't give a shit about your privacy? What a cool platform. But hey, more animated stickers for you! How do you know 500 million people feel embarrassed when someone mention Signal?, it is not they use Telegram cause is end-to-end encrypted is because many of them do not care it is, they look other features Telegram are giving to users. > Every single peer I've discussed have thought Telegram is as secure as Signal

Yes, this is the result of years of purposely quite misleading marketing about their security. They're 100% guilty of that. A lot of people think that literally nobody can read your Telegram messages, which is false - the server (and whoever manages it) can

> Don't they realize its an undisputable fact had Telegram servers been managed with SolarWinds' Orion, 100% of Telegram group messages would now be in the hands of the Russians

I think this would not be the case. Telegram has this weird habit of building its tools from the ground-up. Almost every technology they use is self-made. Their apps try as much as possible to avoid to rely on third-party frameworks, everything's self-made. I've heard (this is just a leak from people who've been able to see telegram's architecture internals) they rewrote their custom implementation of DHCP, DNS, HTTP, MySql and wrote their filesystem on top. They apparently also rewrote openssl. And a lot of this stuff is written on what is the legacy of kphp, a programming language some of Telegram's engineers wrote while they worked for VK. All of this to say that they somehow ""minimized"" the risk of third-party failures (lol). It's very weird of them anyway, very unusual approach to technology and tools. And a very resources-expensive one Y'all sound like you're being hunted by the government. I never said I spoke for the 500 million people. What I said was ""we"", and I was referring to people like myself: Who like the app but are concerned about its security. It was you who drew the conclusion I meant 500 million users, and it was you who spoke for all of them. But that's now sorted out. Let's get back to the topic.

Do you think Telegram group chats should be E2EE? Do Telegram users deserve privacy from hackers that might one day penetrate Telegram's servers? If not, how would you defend the developers when shit has hit the fan? I'm not against Telegram, I'm against insecure systems in general, and if you can somehow guarantee to me and every user here that Telegram will never be hacked, then let's hear the evidence. I know right! It's almost like living in the most [free country in the world](https://www.businessinsider.com/countries-most-freedom-in-the-world-2018-4?r=US&IR=T#1-finland-tie-27) gives me room to think about my privilege."

Voice Chats Done Right;57;kioueu;Telegram;https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats;40;;2020-12-23 10:44:04;"How do I start a voice chat? Anyone figured it out?

edit: I see only the ""owner"" can start it They say Voice Chats are not group calls, what is the difference? If it was done right it would have sensitivity manual calibration like discord. They say ""voice chats done right"", but where's the mention about the feature being end-to-end encrypted? Signal is always E2EE, even [https://jitsi.org/](https://jitsi.org/) is E2EE for voice and video chats.

I love Telegram's features but they seem to lack the basic security and that's **very** troubling. Sweet! I'm the owner of a group chat and the option is not even available on android? anyone else have this issue I can't create or participate in Voice Chats on my iPhone SE (1st gen), the buttons simply don't show up. However, it does work on my iPad Pro. I have updated to the latest Telegram version on both devices.

Does anyone know about any limitations / compatibility issues? Is it possible to play a system sound through voice chat? I think it sucks that only an administrator can start a Voice Chat. Group users can't make a call if the administrator is not available ... Do people really like voice chats? I actually always find it really annoying when someone sends me a ""voice text,"" although I can understand there are people and situations when they might be useful. Discord Discord like video stream when?? From the article:   
*""To create a Voice Chat and find your own unique way of using them, open the profile of any group where you're an admin, tap (⋯) or (⋮) and select Start Voice Chat. ""* Always active vs dialling a call and the app ringing. More like a discord server than a phone call. Signal will always be superior for security, but is severely lacking in UI and features. Telegram is perfect for casual conversation, meme groups, and low-security communication when you don't want to support big corporate platforms. Video and voice calls are e2e encrypted by default. But I'm not sure about a feature this big (it allows thousands of people). 

And I think e2e encryption would limit this feature (there are to many people) so, I guess it's not end to end encrypted but maybe client to server encrypted. I'm admin of a group and for me it's not available also...
Don't know what to do. Did you make sure to upgrade to the latest version of Telegram? Once I did that, it was immediately available to enable. Admin can just leave the voice chat open, they can start it then come and go as they please like any other user. When they go they choose whether to leave or end the voice chat. At first I felt the same, but that's just because I deal with smaller groups. For larger groups it makes sense. If anyone could open a chat, things could get out of hand.

Perhaps a solution down the line will be the concept of ""roles"" or ""permission groups"". This isn't a voice message. It's more like a live conference call that you can pop in to and out of as you like. The voice chat isn't saved to listen back to like a voice message. Boy u are sure great to be friend with *why you booing me?* Yep there's even an icon in the toolbar to start a voice chat if you're the group admin! I have no such option ... maybe every member of the group need to update to last version ? Element does the same with their conferences This. To me looks similar to what discord does to voice channels. Well Signal is catching up on features, and every feature deployed is a secure one.

On Telegram there's a subset of secure features, they don't see security as a property of all features.

>Telegram is perfect for casual conversation, meme groups, and  low-security communication when you don't want to support big corporate  platforms.

That's a fair assessment. But when the front page says ""**Telegram** messages are heavily encrypted"" that sort of gives the wrong vibe. Sure, they're not lying and saying Telegram's messages are end-to-end encrypted. But it's just standard client-server encryption, which doesn't mean anything. If there's a third party with access to your private messages, they're not private. Would Telegram state on their front page

>We use client-server encryption so we can at will access your messages

They wouldn't because it sounds bad. But it's the truth. Why won't they tell things like how it is, if it's not a bad thing?

EDIT: Furthermore, the front page also says

### Secure

**Telegram** keeps your messages safe from hacker attacks.

&#x200B;

This is claim is **much** more questionable. If Telegram's servers are hacked, 100% of group chats leak. 100% non-secret chats leak. 100% of metadata leaks, including the fact you've opted to use E2EE with specific users. That's very sensitive information.

Claiming the servers are magically impervious to hackers creates a shit ton of pressure to NOT reveal an attack when it happens. I'm saying when, because if is not a realistic scenario. [https://www.businessinsider.com/security-mikko-hypponen-all-fortune-500-companies-hacked-2015-10](https://www.businessinsider.com/security-mikko-hypponen-all-fortune-500-companies-hacked-2015-10) >it allows thousands of people

Is this necessary? My Jitsi group calls break when two people are trying to speak at the same time. How are you going to manage a thousand people in a voice chat?

&#x200B;

>(there are to many people)

So have non-E2EE super-group calls? Also, Signal's E2EE group chats have 1001 member limit: [https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/443f1a1554a9910eb0179b93035fa475f8201204/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/util/FeatureFlags.java#L190](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/443f1a1554a9910eb0179b93035fa475f8201204/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/util/FeatureFlags.java#L190)

&#x200B;

>guess it's not end to end encrypted but maybe client to server encrypted.

How does client-server encryption protect from third parties, including

* Telegram developers (you can trust them, they'll never serve you ~~ads~~ targeted ads) and
* Any nation state actor who hacks their servers covertly? In the group, tap the header, then click on the menu from the group settings. You should see the option there. if you figure out can you let me know I'm thinking that's maybe more a rollout thing.
It seems that I can't even access Voice chat in other groups if there is one available. I'm using the latest version of telegram on my android device As the comment replying to you mentioned, it's likely still rolling out. If you're using Android, check the Playstore's ""*What's New*"" for Telegram - If it has mention of *Voice Chats*, you can uninstall and reinstall Telegram, and it **should** pull the latest version. It depends on the type of breach but yeah, in general it's less secure

That's the thing I've always disliked about Telegram's Marketing (I don't really care about it being E2EE, I care about them claiming to be more secure while not implemnting it)

In fact, as bad as it sounds, WhatsApp is more secure than Telegram in that regard 
>Is this necessary? My Jitsi group calls break when two people are trying to speak at the same time. How are you going to manage a thousand people in a voice chat?

Is that necessary? At least for me, no. It's not. It's 50 people and I think that's too much. 

But because this is more like a push an talk kind of conversation, then it has the potential to be handled better in the future. 

I'm not behind those decisions, so I'm obviously not the right person to tell you why. 


>So have non-E2EE super-group calls? Also, Signal's E2EE group chats have 1001 member limit:

Oh. As far as I knew, I [read here](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007319331-Group-chats#:~:text=Size%20limit%20of%20150%20members) that Signal groups had a size limit of 150 members. But even if it's a ""recommend size"", you already know that, with e2e encryption, [the bigger the group, the slowest it becomes and all of that. ](https://youtu.be/Q0_lcKrUdWg)

I'm pro of some kind of Group Secret Chats with a most modest size and that such group allowed the e2e encrypted video and voice calls. So I'll give you the side on that. 


>How does client-server encryption protect from third parties, including

For that there's the servers spread over the world. Also I've read that that information it's encrypted against engineers that has access to the servers. Because they rent servers. 

For why that information is not open source, [there's this article I found where Pavel talks about it ](https://www.eldiario.es/turing/moviles_y_tabletas/telegram-pavel-durov-entrevista-app-movil-seguridad_1_5044479.html)(I honestly didn't know about this article and it explains some points that can be understandable but I guess that's not enough). I tried reinstalling telegram, but it did not work.
Voice chat option is still not available 😭

Seems I have to wait.... Well, we can hope that as Signal gets more usable, Telegram devs feel pressure to start fixing their security. The problem is however they're drowning in technical debt when it comes to implementing privacy preserving versions of each feature. At some point they might have to rewrite the entire protocol which might cause problems. Signal is in better situation. As for WA, yeah I guess it boils down to whether or not the metadata it leaks is part of your threat model. Personally I see metadata as more black-and-white thing, to hide it you need a lot more than just trustworthy server maintainer. While I trust Moxie more than I'd trust e.g. a peer of mine to host a Matrix server, I think Briar/Cwtch are on the right track and I try to move my work with TFC to functional onion service based design. We're living interesting times in that Signal is getting there as soon as usernames are out. Telegram is running out of interesting features to add so security might get more focus. Cwtch is moving from alpha, and Matrix is working on adding p2p. >with e2e encryption, [the bigger the group, the slowest it becomes and all of that. ](https://youtu.be/Q0_lcKrUdWg)

The speed of E2EE doubles every two years as per Moore's law. Signal also set the recommended group size at 151 users. In 2023, phones can easily encrypt a copy to 300 contacts, in 2026 they can do that to 600 users. In 2029 they can do that to 1200 users.

Also I would claim that 150 is way beyond a limit of where people stop thinking a group is private. In my experience at around 40-60 users a group loses its expectation of privacy, i.e. that what is said in the group stays in the group.

Smartphones are perfectly capable of handling that these days. It's not like encryption needs to be made stronger and slower every year.

>I'm pro of some kind of Group Secret Chats with a most modest size

I fully agree. 150 is a good number, it has a lot of headroom. And it can be scaled as HW advances.

>For that there's the servers spread over the world

Everyone always claims this, but nobody has ever explained to me how an SQL entry to database can be encrypted with a key on a CPU that's physically located in Telegram data center in e.g. Netherlands, when the key is always split in data centers stored in data centers residing in several countries under different jurisdictions.

As someone who majors in computer science and who specializes in computer security and secure communication I can tell you. That's impossible.

While sure, **at rest** the key can be stored in several shares e.g. protected by the best protection out there, [Shamir's secret sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing), to be able to **use** that key, the key must **by definition** be available to the process that's doing the encrypted database entry. That means if someone hacks the server, they can with a privilege escalation exploit steal the database encryption key from the server's RAM (where it must by definition be available when encryption operation takes place).

>Because they rent servers.

What do we know about the company who the servers were rented from? Were they using SolarWinds' Orion tool? [https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/16/tech/solarwinds-orion-hack-explained/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/16/tech/solarwinds-orion-hack-explained/index.html)

If, wouldn't that mean the Russian state hackers (called Cozy Bear) had access to Telegram's servers for months? I just downloaded and installed the official APK from the Telegram website to check, and can confirm it's the latest :)"

Then just give him your Telegram username, preferably one not tied to your online identity, and have him message you. Or you message him first.

Question about Telegram contacts sync;16;ki23vl;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ki23vl/question_about_telegram_contacts_sync/;23;"I have a question about how contact syncing works on Telegram. So let's consider a scenario where there are 3 phone numbers (A, B, C) on your phone's contacts. 

&#x200B;

|Your phone|Telegram Client|Telegram Server|
|:-|:-|:-|
|A, B, C|||

""Telegram Client"" represents your contacts as it appears from your app, and ""Telegram Server"" represents numbers actually saved on Telegram's servers. If at the time you synced your contacts, only A and B has Telegram installed... 

&#x200B;

|Your phone|Telegram Client|Telegram Server|
|:-|:-|:-|
|A, B, C|A, B|A, B|

Does it work like this; where the phone numbers are compared to your phone's contacts, but only the ones that provides a match will be ""saved"" to the server? Or...

&#x200B;

|Your phone|Telegram Client|Telegram Server|
|:-|:-|:-|
|A, B, C|A, B|A, B, (C)|

Is it more like this: where your entire contacts are first uploaded to Telegram's server, and only ones that has Telegram installed are visible from your client?

&#x200B;

This also brings up another question: What happens when B decides to delete their Telegram account? I know from the client, we will see a ""Deleted User"", But assuming that syncing is now turned off:

&#x200B;

|Your phone|Telegram Client|Telegram Server|
|:-|:-|:-|
|A, B, C|A, Deleted User|A|

Does the server simply delete the number B from being associated with your account?

&#x200B;

|Your phone|Telegram Client|Telegram Server|
|:-|:-|:-|
|A, B, C|A, Deleted User|A,  (B)|

Or does it merely hide B from your view? And if that is the case, what happens when someone decides to make an account with the number B? Does it reappear?";2020-12-22 12:30:14;">Is it more like this: where your entire contacts are first uploaded to Telegram's server, and only ones that has Telegram installed are visible from your client?

This must be how it works because you get notifications on all devices when a contact joins Telegram. 

>what happens when someone decides to make an account with the number B? Does it reappear?

Yes From what I know:

Deleted profiles stay connected to your account but named as ""Deleted Account"" and without any profile details.

Whenever you're prompted to ""sync device contacts"" its synced with both your local client and the server.
So deleting a contact locally won't affect server saves. (unless you delete it from the person's Telegram profile)


For whether the whole list is stored on server and then filtered, or locally filtered, I beleive the whole is sent to the server.

That's how they ping you for newly joined contacts (I assume) Ugh. This means I done messed up..Am gonna need to purge contacts from Telegram and add ppl one by one manually. I was rather hoping I wouldn't have to do this. So even though person who's deleted their account will show up as deleted account no matter what, it actually makes a difference whether you've deleted them from your Telegram contacts or not... Nuts. How come/ Was trying to remove clutter from my Telegram contacts. My plan was to sync contact once, turn it off, and then remove people I do not want to talk to. I initially thought this would create a slimmed down collection of contacts, containing ONLY the people I want to talk to. I had hoped that this way, I would not have to deal with being notified with unwanted join notice, or other people being notified of my presence.

So if this is the way it works... I cannot achieve the result I want this way. The only way would be to remove everyone and add people I want one by one manually. You can turn off the notifications about your contacts joining telegram. \#1 That only removes the notifications that I see - I would have no control over me showing up for others. 

\#2 There is a privacy option that prevents people not in your contacts from finding you by number. This option is much less useful if you have invisible numbers in your contact list. If someone ends up with a number that used to be in my contacts, I don't want that random person to be able to find me You can change that option too so your number is never shared You can change who can **""see your number""** to **Nobody**, but there is no way to prevent **""discovery by your number""** to someone **in your contacts**. I want to remove this possibility 100% - which is not possible if I just sync my contacts. You've lost me. People who don't have your number... won't see you on Telegram unless you message them. What is your concern exactly?

If you have them in your contacts and you don't want to talk to them... just don't message them. I work in service, and I need to give out my numbers to random people all the time. I, in turn, need to add a ton of people I don't personally know to my phone for quick access.

So... my concern is that one of those people, who did not have telegram installed at the time of my syncing contacts, will later join and be notified of my presence. Which definitely looks like it will happen.

Telegram is the messenger I use to ensure I only get private messages - I just want to be able to trust it to be that way.

I realize that this entire problem could have been avoided with a separate work phone number. Unfortunately, dual sims are not really a thing here, and I don't want another device that I have to carry and charge. > will later join and be notified of my presence

No, they won't be notified of your presence. **You** will be notified, not them. But why wouldn't they? They have my number, and I will also have theirs. You joined telegram first, so you get *notified* when a contact joins after you. But when they join Telegram, they'll simply see all of their contacts. If they have your number saved in their phone then they'll be able to message you... but that's to be expected right. Okay perhaps I wasn't clear - when I said be notified, I was not just talking about the ""xxx joined Telegram"" message. 

Like I said, I give out my phone number  to a bunch of people. I don't want to show up on their contact list at all - so that I can be sure that they don't even have the option to message me.

For myself, this is a personal preference - but for many, the stakes are much higher. Think of the Hong Kong protestors for instance, who needs to be certain that unsolicited people cannot even identify them as Telegram user. >I give out my phone number  to a bunch of people. I don't want to show up on their contact list at all 

This is a bit ironic isn't it? What's even the point of contact lists? It's not, though. I am not giving out my phone number to talk to them on Telegram. I am giving them out because I need to maintain phone contact with them. 

If you don't get the need to keep some things separate, fine. Just accept that that some people do, and I am one of them. Well, alright. Telegram uses phone numbers as a way of finding users.  Anyone who has your number will see you in their contact list just like with Whatsapp, and you can't prevent that.

You can block users of course. YES YOU CAN prevent it. That is the entire point of the privacy setting ""Find me by my number""

[https://telegram.org/blog/scheduled-reminders-themes](https://telegram.org/blog/scheduled-reminders-themes)

BUT, now that I know this is the way contact syncing works, its effectiveness is greatly reduced in my situation; which is that I have to give out my phone number on a regular basis to people I don't want to contact privately (and also that I have to add those people to my phone's contact list). Hence my need to purge my contact list. Oh now I'm confused. This option is new to me. Isn't this exactly what you want? 

> Setting Who Can Find Me By My Number to ‘My Contacts’ will ensure that random users who add your number as a contact are unable to match your profile to that number. This prevents your discovery by people NOT in your contact list. But as I have explained SO MANY TIMES, my work requires me to add people to my phone's contact list. This means if I sync my contacts, any one of those people can find me by my number. I don't want that to happen. Oh I see there's no ""nobody"" option for that. I understand now.

If you don't want them to see you on Telegram, you need to delete them from your Telegram (which seems fair). Presumably this will sync and take effect immediately."

Do you face the same problem? Do you have a solution? Thanks .;2020-12-21 21:49:04;Maybe you disable the notifications for Telegram. Check your Telegram settings. Which device, which OS? turn off battery optimization for the TG app, Huawei has insanely aggressive battery optimization that basically prevents any app that isn’t whitelisted from receiving notifications. see https://dontkillmyapp.com/ for more info Also happens to me and someone i know, Samsung note 8 here, that other person uses a Huawei tho It is not a settings problem. I will give you an example when I send a message to a person and he is connected to the Internet. He does not receive any notifications of my message. After a while or from tomorrow, he finds my message that I sent him yesterday. I mean when the Telegram does not open and he is connected, he cannot know that I contacted him, and the opposite when someone sends me  I only get any notification when I open the app .

In most cases, police obtaining a device means bad news because files getting deleted isn't the end-all-be-all. Sometimes they can be recovered and then it won't matter what you used to communicate.

If you delete the chat, the files are gone though. Telegram even specifically says that no matter which chat you delete, it gets wiped for good, no way to reinstate it. If the police won't be able to recover deleted files, you're good. I doubt it but honestly IT forensics involves a huge amount of factors.

My girlfriend is getting harassed but we have no idea who is this. We tried looking for his information but is seems we can only see his user and not mobile number. I advised my girlfriend not to accept the message and block the person but it seems he use another account using different username we want to track down his mobile number because my girl is getting scared and creeped.;2020-12-21 10:38:52;"They will get bored of creating accounts (and acquiring phone numbers) before you get tired of blocking them. Sorry it’s not a perfect answer. If he doesn't know her phone number, you can block his accounts and then change your username.
That worked perfectly for me Change privacy so only your contacts can see your number, change username. If he can still contact then it's one of her contacts. to add onto everybody:

phone number privacy settings are in settings > privacy > phone number. you can also set it to “nobody” and then change “find me” settings to “my contacts” , so only contacts she has in TG can discover her acc by phone number. 

if the account has a username and you decide to change it, i suggest squatting the username in a channel, as the harasser might be harassing her to get her to give it up. Setting - Privacy and Security - Phone Number- Nobody 

Can this work? You can't Suggest your girl to change her Telegram username, and check whatever that person ia the member of groups that your girlfriend is I'd recommend the following.

> Download Plus Messenger on Android you can see the Users ID.

> When got said users ID delete account.


> Sign up but with a different number from a VoIP service such as iPlum.

> When finished all that, continue to settings and security and privacy.

> When all is changed to only my contacts and nobody, she should be good to go.

>> Good luck and Happy Christmas! :) Block the person. You can remove your phone number and change your name in your Telegram profile. U can't! Just hide your phone number from visibility so that only people can search or contact you via username only., and block that person and change your username.so next time If he wanna back he must know u r new username? Which is not possible!! so what i should do here is delete  her telegram account then make a new one with different username? what about ignoring this person forever (you can delete chats even without reading them, simply press on it and delete from the main screen)? she can download the Telegram app Teleteens - it has an anti-harassment mode called ''girl mode'' which she can use. It's your dad... [deleted] He can always save telegram user id and contact her Right, my bad. But telegram wouldn't show the new id to someone I blocked right? Telegram user id does not change. You have to destroy account and recreate it to get a new user id. It is linked to telegram account You can't write a message to a account by just knowing it's ID I'm talking about username And I'm talking about user id, from the start :) I've never seen user ID It is not visible in app but there are ways to see it (such as 3rd party apps or bots So people can message you if they know your id just like username?

I've been receiving for month a notification from Telegram : You have a new message. When I click on the notification to read the message it opens on my telegram conversations however there is no new messages. 

I must have receive this notification at least a hundred times. Is there anyone that had the same issue ?";2020-12-20 14:59:36;"Are you on iOS? AFAIK, it’s a known bug and restarting the OS should fix it (at least temporarily). I don't know if this works on iOs, but worth a try. Open the settings, go to the bottom. Long press the version number (you should see a smiley), release, long press once again to show a hidden menu. There's an option to ""read all chats"". Happened to me a few times. If I remember correctly, you can long-press the chat item, then make it unread, then go inside it to make it read. I'm brand new, desktop user, and like OP I just got a 'ding' and the number '1' in my taskbar icon, as if I have an incoming message. I don't have any incoming messages.

Like I said, I'm a newbie. Maybe I'm doing something wrong? I've had exactly one chat so far, which went swimmingly. I do hope Telegram isn't going to announce non-existent messages often. maybe the user sending the message deleted it (for you as well) before you clicked on the notification. I googled the bug and if I got it right the IOS does not launch the notification service process in response to an incoming notification. 
What I do not understand is I get an incoming notification to a message that does not exist. Hey thank you for your answer. The problem is there is nothing to unread, like I am getting notifications of a new message where there is no message at all. The notification would have disappeared then, if I'm not mistaken. If they saw it the moment it was sent and it still read ""You have a new message"" without any specific information, it would mean that OP has disabled message previews unless accessed directly in the app. The other end deleting the message for both ends has nothing to do with it. No, I understand there’s actually no new message. But does TG say you in which chat is the new message? That chat you should make unread then read again. The ultimate solution should be uninstalling and reinstalling TG >No they don’t tell me in which chat there is a new message, and I did not get any message at the time the notifications were sent. I’m gonna try uninstalling and reinstalling rn"

Do they too see my phone number?";2020-12-20 08:32:05;"Do you see their phone number? Because you had their phonenumber in you contacts, Telegram uploaded the phone number to their servers, as this is one of your contacts. 

When you deleted the number from your phone, the number isn’t deleted from the servers, so Telegram still thinks it’s your contact. Yes, I can see it.

Edit: I can see their phone number, username, and picture just like for all the other mutual contacts but I don't have this one person's phone number in my phone, and I recieved a notification that said they joined Telegram and now I can see them in my chats. That's pretty much it. I had to resync the contacts. Sorry for the late reply, they most likely have your number saved. I'm not sure how it works with the join notifications, but typically, if you see their numbers, one party has a number saved.

Depending on Chat size you'd have to send several messages with about 50 mentions, and even then they aren't even guaranteed to go through.

You're better of just pinning a message with notification enabled. This pushes a notification to everyone in your chat. Search for @all bot username @ping_allbot There's \[at\]MasterTagAlertBot that allows you to use \[at\]tagall to send a private message to all group members who have started the bot. Otherwise, you can pin a message with notification. you could temp pin the message, that alerts everyone"

Blocked someone accidently who I've spoken with for 4 years and it deleted our chat history entirely (and they confirmed they didn't from our end) Did you check with the other person if they have cleared the history? 

Because, even though you might not have cleared the chat while blocking them but they might have deleted the chat for both of you.  

That's not a bug, that's the best part in telegram. > That's not a bug, that's the best part in telegram.

For me, that's the absolute worst feature of Telegram and the one thing I would change about an otherwise brilliant app.  

I communicate regularly with someone who's not very tech savvy and who has the most infuriating OCD habit of deleting all messages from her chats, after she's had a conversation with someone [not for security reasons. Just some weird OCD 'tidying up' mania she has].

I, on the other hand, like to keep all my old SMS, messages, emails, etc. for posterity [maybe I'm OCD in the other direction!]. So I have a constant trepidation of logging into Telegram some day and finding our entire conversation history has gone because she forgot to untick the box which says *""Delete for me and <other person>""* while carrying out one of her clearing up sessions.

Even that personal experience aside, I still think allowing one person to be able to unilaterally remove 'content' from another person's computer, without their consent is just a horrible design decision --especially in an application which is supposed to be all about privacy and protecting your data from abuse by 3rd parties.

Obviously, as evidenced by your comment, some people really like this 'feature'. But I'm sure just as many don't and it's so potentially destructive, I think Telegram should at least give users the option to disallow remote deletion of their content."

telegram censoring a casual channel with 10k uploads because of “pornographic content” this is absurd.;1;kfudqc;Telegram;https://v.redd.it/kd707vs2l0661;45;[deleted];2020-12-19 00:44:39;"Blame Apple I know in TelegramX there's an option to ""Display Sensitive Content"" (not exactly sure if this means content deemed as ""pornographic"").

&#x200B;

But I cant seem to find that setting in the Original Telegram app for Android. However, it's there on the Desktop version.

&#x200B;

Settings > Privacy and Security > Sensitive Content  


Hope that helps! I think it is because you didn't share your channel It’s because of AppStore and Google Play restrictions Is there a way to fix this? Had the same happen to me on achannel i was in. Now every time someone sends something it just says “This message couldn't be displayed.....” Oh he's horny don’t upload porn or anything close to porn and you won’t have any issues. 

or if you are going to, keep the chat a secret. i’ve had a chat with porn in it for around 4 years now, it hasn’t been touched at all because i never gave the invite link to anyone else. It had nothing to do with apple, it’s all on telegram. Apple doesn’t care what people share inside an app, just like how reddit is full of graphic content. They just dont let porn apps into store. Don’t see such option in my desktop app. lol It’s regional, people in europe dont have any issues accessing graphic channels, but my question is why telegram censored a channel that only shares instagram photos and mark it as pornographic. Apple blocks it. On other devices you can watch whatever you want. I've heard censoring can be disactivated - google it. Dude there is like million porn subs, but i really wanted this to be a channel like those channels in instagram that share pics of insta models, no nudity. No, just don't use apple.  No, Apple forced Telegram to put those restrictions in Man, porn on telegram are free. On Android u can watch all the nsfw shit you want. That's apple who doesn't want porn on the store, so telegram has to censor it (obviously only on the Apple store) otherwise it risks to be removed (which has already happened several times) Lol, really? Apple blocks it. On other devices you can watch whatever you want. I've heard censoring can be disactivated - google it. It’s APPLE’s policy. You can watch porn on telegram for android just fine. Is this Telegram for Windows Desktop? It’s regional. I’m on iOS and in Italy and I can’t access pornographic or copyrighted content via the app. It’s an AppStore limitation, you can access those channels with no problem using tgdesktop. By chance do you know if i sign in on android I’d be able to see the chat’s content i cant see on ios? I have googled it and all I found was people saying to sign in on the web version where you can turn off the filter but mine is already off. the restriction happens on Android too lmao So why it's not true with reddit? This is telegram for ipad, but i look into the PC app and didn’t find the option you mentioned. I cant access even on tgdesktop. I think yes. You also can try desktop/web versions. Google how to bypass it. ;) Never seen that. I can open any channel. ... Ask Apple? Ok, I just checked and you can enable that option through the web version of Telegram as well. And it will carry over across ALL your devices with Telegram.

&#x200B;

Just navigate to: [web.telegram.org](https://web.telegram.org)

Go to Settings > Scroll down > Enable 'Show Sensitive Content' Where are you from? Oh and also, did you download tgdesktop from your OS’s store? because your acc is from a region that isn’t restricted maybe because in Reddit these subs image videos etc are always (or at least 99+%) tagged NSFW so are not shown by default and can also been hidden completely.
In telegram there is noch such warning whatsoever What is the channel?

&#x200B;

Of course it's ONLY for the sake of troubleshooting...LoL Hm, what region has restrictions? Hmm... that make sense It’s my channel, i uploaded instagram pictures of models but after it hit 10k uploads got restricted because of adult content, there wasn’t any nudes in it, just instagram posts, also seems like that option doesn’t exist in my region. no comprehensive list but places like india, indonesia, iran, vietnam, and some more i cant remember from the top of my head I guess that is a possibility depending on your region. Sorry I couldnt be of more help with this.  


Do you have it setup as a Private or Public channel? Ah, okay. Didn't know about that. Do you mean it is impossible to bypass those restrictions? It was private, thanks for you time 🖤 basically. 

but you make an account from a region that isn’t restricted, that usually works. Do you mean phone number or IP address? phone number Ah, okay. I used TextNow service to get a free american number."

Telegram userbots and other issues, any hint?;4;kfpugl;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kfpugl/telegram_userbots_and_other_issues_any_hint/;5;"o/ All.

Recently i have been added to a group with a tons of random users in it, after they added me I realized they were adding a tons of random people each time, using different accounts (userbots). Now the group has hit the 5k members all random users added from other ( unknown ) groups. This is not a problem for me i know, i can disable the adding feature in the options but this will reflect on all the new Telegram users who have no knowledge.

What do you think about that?  how can be a report effective if they are using more than 30/40 userbots at time?

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ix8fg28lfz561.gif

In addition, it's a long time that i'm trying to report a very big porn network but i got no answer from telegram support.

Basically the network is structured like this:

Promotion Channels (who make make money from ads/random pron pics from internet)

Selective teen Channels ( where the titles become clickbait for people who search for underage porn)

Telegram groups ( more than 60k people in)

Telegram groups, where the real problem start, tons of leaked private images, barely legal girls, people searching for CP ( and concluding the share in **pvt/dm**) and these kind of stuff.

&#x200B;

These groups have already become famous in Italy for ""inciting pedophilia"" in the last email I sent to the telegram support there were more than 30 channels and groups, only some of these have been closed and i received no answer. Telegram makes a mistake, sometimes it closes the reported group without even reading the pinned messages ""backup group: new telegram link"" thus making the closing of the first one ""useless"".

What do you think i should do about this? Just ignoring this or what? Any hint will be very appreciated.

I Love Telegram but these stuff kinda trigger me.";2020-12-18 20:46:36;"Just press ""Report spam and leave"" button, let Telegram handle this issue AFAIK there is a cap for each account on adding users to the groups, so for large 5k+ groups I guess you'll need a bunch of accounts.

I was also added into random groups, just change privacy settings of who can add me to groups to nobody is my contacts.

Then I don't understand I'm afraid just follow the instructions you were given but do it inside the Telegram app. 

the reason you can mark all chats as read is because it was added to the app via the hidden debug menu - meaning, it’s already in the app. makes sense, no? Didn't you say the procedure had to be done from the Android settings, rather than the Telegram settings? Because I tried doing it inside Telegram, and it did absolutely nothing i’m not the original commenter but they never mentioned anything about system settings.

this is what you're doing? Nope, I was doing it in Telegram's config. I presume doing what you showed marks every single notification (including missed calls, messages, emails and so forth) as read... while I only want to get rid of Telegram's. Am I correct? that is Telegram’s config. that’s the settings menu. that video shows me opening the debug menu, where the option you want is. so now i’m really curious where you’re clicking Okay, now it works.

To me this means:

1. The hacker knew my phone number 
2. The hacker received the login code somehow - either they somehow intercepted my SMS or had remote access to a device of mine that was logged into Telegram

&#x200B;

To try and remedy this I performed these actions: 

&#x200B;

1. Immediately logged out all active sessions (did not see any suspicious IP addresses)
2. Canceled the deletion process using the link I received in Telegram / by email
3. Contacted mobile provider - they could not identify any SIM swap / clone activity

Is there a chance you might have upset your government? That's a tricky one... Intercepting SMS is not impossible, but rather complicated. I don't see the benefit unless you are a high profile person.

I would look for suspicious activities on the desktop. Windows isn't known for its strength against malwares. It's possible you have some rootkit or sniffer there, able to read messages. 

What's your connection type (Settings > advanced > connection type) ? If you disabled proxy, it uses http, making some content vulnerable to sniffing. Let me tell you one story, I'm a security researcher myself, and to do ss7 attack, or other types of sms tracking attacks is not really hard if you're some kind of professional in this but this story is little different. There are so many apps that allow you to buy or rent for free online phone numbers, some of them are fake non-existing virtual numbers. And one day when I used one of those apps I somehow managed to log into someone's account, not only Telegram but also WhatsApp. This already existing account was someone's real phone number, I wrote a message to his saved messages to set up 2fa and delete all other sessions (some other person could just lock that person out of his account), ofc if you have 2fa it would be harder to log in (at least the way I did that), and yeah there's a chance that someone can try to [delete your account](https://my.telegram.org/auth) in which they will fail because they have to be logged in or request to delete account by clicking ""I forgot my 2fa password"" or smth like that which you can cancel as you already did. So the point is that it's not OS problem or app problem, the problem is in your phone number's provider, either they do some selling stuff with personal information and ability to use this number (like sms or phone calls spoofing which even I was a victim of), or someone breached their data and use customers information, so the solution is to change your phone number or even a provider, and always set up 2fa Maybe you should check this [news](https://www.google.pt/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/12/12/mystery-russian-telegram-hacks-intercept-secret-codes-to-spy-on-messages/amp/) out. It seems remarkably similar to the situation you have experienced. Telegram support probably hasn’t responded, as this problem isn’t from their side. Either someone got access to all of your SMS messages and got code that way, or one of your devices could be infected with viruses. For last one I would suggest doing a complete wipe and OS reinstall on all of your devices Most likely your windows machine is compromised. This explains how the attacker could gain access to your telegram verification code.

If the attacker turned your device into a reverse proxy he can use your IP address too.
I would monitor the traffic on your windows machine.
Or better kill it and set it up new. Is it possible to delete a Telegram account by having access to the phone number but not to the Telegram account? About how it got the code, maybe it could be this kind of attack I recently discovered? 

https://youtu.be/dkvQqatURdM 

It's called an SS7 Attack. To be honest, I'm not familiar with the concept, so I'm not sure how hard it is to try one.

More information about it: 

https://securityboulevard.com/2020/01/a-step-by-step-guide-to-ss7-attacks/ are you using VOIP numbers, in any way? Telegram creates account based on Phone Numbers, so if you loose your phone number you have lost your account.  


Ponder This: how will you verify your authenticity to Telegram Officials, if you do not own the Phone Number?!? :\\  


The message was sent by Telegram so that they can verify that you still own the Phone Number, or clean up / delete your account, since you no longer use your Telegram.

&#x200B;

If somebody bought a new phone number, but (in some regions there are phone number recycling) , the phone number was already occupied by a Telegram account, should Telegram deny the new user from creating a Telegram Account? Long shot question, but are you using or running any bot on your account? Really interesting. Is it possible to buy this number as an online sim?

I have a couple of telegram accounts that I lost sim cards from but I have 2F authentication. I wonder what will happen if the new owners of these numbers decide to install telegram and claim their number... Enable MFA. (Not just the code telegram requires but an additional password.) Use voip #. With carrier phones the government can clone SMS and intercept msgs The last time I did add a new device, it seemed that TG doesn't send SMS as long as there still is an active Telegram session. So, that would mean that one of your active sessions was compromised.

BUT if the whole session was compromised (e.g. trojan on your PC) then there is no reason to do all this. They could just steal the complete login state.

So maybe it was an app that has access to your push notification texts. As the code is in the front of the notification it would be rather easy to get the code that way. Cheap fitness tracking bands would be my first suspect... Antivirus software doesn't find shit. Any semi-decent hacker will ""crypt"" his malware. 
Move on to Linux. Makes life easier and more secure. Very.  Nothing that I can think of... rather expect they were after either my handle or my admin access to a reasonably large group chat Windows desktop application attack vector is also my current thought - I also immediately removed it via add/remove programs on Windows 10 and then found the .exe still sat in ""C:\\Users\\\*\*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Telegram Desktop\\Telegram.exe""

I did not change the proxy settings on the desktop app

My whole setup is behind a pfsense firewall and as far as I know I haven't installed anything suspicious..

Also, so far this attack seems to be constrained to Telegram.. also, atleast for now, I'd recommend uninstalling Telegram desktop..

could it be some malware on his Android though? I also thought about these online sim cards. So it's possible. Theoretically, if you were looking to break into a certain account, could you request their number? I hope it's random, otherwise it's a huge security breach indeed Tying phone number to any messenger is a bad idea tbh. It's risky and unnecessary attack surface. I hope Signal add support for no phone number registration soon. Clean windows installation is the plan, I had hoped to find something on the machine to explain this but so far no Malware has been found by windows defender or MalwareBytes.. No, as deletion code is delivered only to Telegram They need to receive the login code, so need access to SMS or telegram account - not just knowing the phone number Definitely possible.. Telegram 2FA is essential, it should be enabled by default. No.. I did not lose my phone number.. After this happened, I took extra precaution and decided to change it. I use bots for automation, sending messages to groups for plex /sonarr / radarr updates etc but that doesn't require me giving up any user credentials Not that I am aware of.. I'd had the number for 14yrs and its provided by a regular mobile operator, not an online service If you read the post properly you will see I did, otherwise I'd have lost the account. Interesting.. I did actually receive an SMS but also, since I created this post I realised that my windows desktop was logged out at the time this all occurred. I don't use fitness trackers but good point.. I don't see any apps with access to notifications currently. I do have an Ubuntu dual boot but need Windows for some things. Perhaps will go down route of using only a VM running on top of Ubuntu for essential windows only tasks (not telegram desktop) If your TFA password is ""weak"" consider giving it a boost. And if you haven't tell the people in your group what has happened and that they should consider activating TFA too.

Good luck. Possible, not likely. Android, despite all its problems, still has a nice sandboxing design, making apps quite independent and makes it hard to read another app's content. But hey, at this point everything is possible... did uninstall immediately - also changed phone numbers and will reinstall my OS Most of them assign you random number, you can change number but it will randomize it again, I don't think that there's any similar service that allows you to choose any number you want but I know some other kind of services in darknet, some of them in clearnet, where you can buy call logs, sms history and internet traffic that was breached by some hackers or by corrupt workers of those telecommunications companies. You can also request location of any person and for that you don't have to enable location on your phone, because these companies can detect your location by the distance from multiple cell towers (e.g. if signal reaches you in 1s from A tower and 1.01s from B tower, then you're somewhere between those 2 towers but you should understand that more towers will send those signals to detect your exact location), you can't really secure yourself from this if you need this sim in your phone all the time

These services just give you saved logs but some professionals can track all of this in real time Telegram supports registration using a virtual phone number, like the one from sites like TextNow use qubes os ;) I did do that too, good advice that should put a stop to literally all possible exploits I'm going down the qubes rabbit hole now lol.. Time to make life far more complicated but more secure.. Except hardware exploits and zero-days, but let's not go full tin foil. make sure your hardware is compatible make sure your hardware is compatible"

Still worth a try if only to add accessibility options. Elderly already have a tough time with apps so having it adapted to them is definitely useful. no judgement on the idea in general; but I'd be very wary with any remote control. Such features can easily be abused by ill-intentioned individuals. what USEFUL Feature did you have in mind that the elderly would want to use? Voice and video messages are one that I think they'd find useful but would struggle to figure out (the switching between formats thing.) Sending and receiving photos and videos is crucial but to make it really clear you'd likely have to hide the rest of the options so grandma doesn't accidentally share her location with the group chat or something.

If you select ""Add to contact"" here, you get a tickbox on the next screen, asking you if you want to share your phone number with that person. If you uncheck this, you will have that person saved to your contacts without having to share your number. users can choose to not show their number to anybody"

This deserves praise. Let's not use this as a turf war. And they have open source server *Telegram* doesn't even have end-to-end encrypted group chat yet...

Edit: italicization and added ""yet"". That's great! Not something I'll be likely to use anytime soon, but still fantastic news!

What really interests me, though, is who'll be first with creating a message app that's both secure and usable and crossplatform with seamless sync so you don't have to rely on your smartphone.

So far Telegram is usable, Signal secure. If only those two could be combined somehow... Any ETA on end-to-end encrypted group chats, like Secret Chats have?

EDIT: referring to Telegram group chats Didn't expect this so quick and surprised that it's for 5 people, thought it was 4 based on the screenshots. I expect Telegram will deliver theirs in early 2021 but I mostly wonder how many people they'll support. The standard to beat right now is, what, 8? Anything above that gets all the attention. The group video calls are adequate. One to one chats are superb. While Telegram video calling is still alpha, the call quality on a reliable connection is comparable. I mean both of them were behind Google on this one so I don't think either one deserves to get praise when it's implemented. What's so exciting about this? They call this competition? Haha. Yeah, we'll see... As for now Telegram allows group calls for more than 60 people (I'm not sure what's the limit in that beta). And I don't expect them to limit their group video calls to ""5 people"".

As for ""because they did it first"", man. I personally wasn't surprised they did. Even the adoption is quite slow (5 people now and it'll arrive to ""legacy groups"" in the coming weeks, it's not instant). At last a worthy opponent! Of course. Competition is good Well said! Finally a competitor 🥲 If only any of the others had as many features, Signal is the only that can really compete. These two are my favorites to use though. True. But Telegram has top features, that signal doesn’t have. But can they possibly prove they're using that server and not some modified version of it? That's why it doesn't matter that much Signal doesn't even allow you to have usernames like telegram. For a privacy app they really be expecting people to give out their phone number.. does signal? secret chats are e2e encrypted How do you expect the chats to seamlessly sync AND be e2e encrypted? The Matrix protocol actually does it.
While it's certainly not as usable as Telegram, it manages to have e2ee on both single and group chats making sync across multiple devices seamless.

It also has encrypted video and audio calls. It's by default e2e encrypted means no inputs are required from any user side to turn on the e2e encryption!! wym?? signal is always and completely ee2e It's a little tricky but the screenshots do show 5 participants; you have to count the person outbound on the device.

Also FaceTime and Duo support 32 people I thought. The video quality in telegram is better, but sadly there's a bug where the camera doesn't start sometimes. Not to mention notifications are messed up. Apparently you're right, [*Google* claims](https://support.google.com/duo/answer/9280240) that all *Duo* calls are end-to-end encrypted... I though group calls weren't e2e encrypted, like the ones from *Zoom*, *Skype* or *Google Meet*. They have had independent third-party audits that verify the legitimacy of their setup, something that Telegram refuses to do. In addition to that, and their code being open-source, they have also been served government subpoenas for data that come up empty because Signal has shown that they physically can't provide anything about their users beyond very minimal pieces of metadata. [deleted] Everything on *Signal* is end-to-end encrypted, so yes. Can you create a secret group? I don't. I don't really expect technology to work at all, much less be a pleasure to use. I've been into it for like 20 years, and almost nothing has improved. Our computers are what, like a million times faster than they were previously? What does that mean? That we can write unoptimized slow and buggy code and get the same performance we did earlier!

I mean Skype was around like a decade ago - has something remarkably improved since then? I still can't video call my friends around the world and expect a high quality call.

I nowadays need 100Mbit/s internet just to surf the basic web quickly and without lag since it's filled with ads and trackers (yes, I use ublock).

The wheel gets re-invented all the time. But come on, how long before we get a fully functional, cross-platform, fully secure, joy to use messenger app? It won't happen. Technology is all about good enough software that make a ton of compromises to get the job done. Trade-offs left and right.

I appreciate the effort by the programmers of both Telegram and Signal. That doesn't mean that I think the end product is perfect - far from it: they both have rather known weaknesses. They are the best products on the market, sure; they suck a bit less than the competition.

All in all, I wish I lived in an era before all this technology. Or in the very distant future when we've already transcended the growing pains of it all. Well, WhatsApp is end to end encrypted but still allows to be accessed on the computer. But technically you still rely on your smartphone. I was referring to Telegram group chats ;-) I was referring to Telegram group chats, sorry. Yeah, I know! They're also rolling it out to Google Messages for people in beta. 

But apparently, it's something you get downvoted for when you point out that the chat apps that are **privacy-focused** are behind Google of all companies in encryption. 

I see encryption as something that should have happened a while ago. Praising them for doing it only now seems disingenuous to me. Still, though, you wouldn't be able to have a big group organising (say) counter-government protests if everyone in the group had to use their phone number. My phone number is private, thanks. I consider it a privacy thing. Insane that you don't. I meant, does Signal have group chats? I imagine it does but just checking. not yet I mean... how do you imagine that to work? E2E encryption literally means the keys are stored on your device and on you devices only, not on the server. And you want your other devices to seamlessly get those keys from somewhere else? WhatsApp kinda does that, but I wouldn't call it seamless, you have to keep your phone online.

There's progress and then there're mathematics. Just like there's no way to transfer information faster than the speed of light, there's no way to secure seamless sync of E2E keys. And I don't nearly have 100Mbit/s internet and I'm fine. It's just you and your evergrowing demand. Oh I thought you were talking about Signal! Sorry ok,np thanks for clarifying The thing with Google though is that, given their long track record of suddenly abandoning projects, no-one in their right mind is going to invest the time and effort required to move all their family and friends onto a messaging app from Google. [deleted] In what world a chat app implements group calls before group chat? Well that was the point for his comment tho “e2e encrypted **group chat**” I'd be happy if the sync worked over wifi. Signal does that, but the desktop app is so buggy it doesn't matter. I don't know if WhatsApp has a desktop client nowadays, but it did sync to web when I used it over a year ago.

Yeah, sure. If you're content with the state of things, I'm happy for you. I just don't like the direction in which things are going or have gone already.

As for my ""evergrowing demand"". Come on, really? I literally stated that I'd rather live in an era before all this technology. What I want is either: technology that is beneficial for humans and works well or no technology. (Tech here meaning computers and the like.) I want simplicity. I'm opposed to all the new ""functionality"" and bloat on the internet. How is ""keep it clean""/KISS ""evergrowing demand""? Seem to me to be the opposite. But to each their own. Does that negate my point?

Nevermind the fact that Google Duo has more than a billion installs on the play store, while Telegram has around half that. Weird. Then what's your phone number? Google Duo? Doesn't even have a chat. But alright, so it does have group chat. Cheers! That was my only doubt. [deleted] 
So _Google Duo_ is a chat app for you... Interesting. > safety & security reasons

I'd argue privacy/safety/security is mutual.

I like privacy to keep myself safe and secure. Hence why I don't give out my phone number or even email to anyone unless required, and when it comes to email I usually give some throwaway email.

This is why I like that Telegram has usernames and I think all privacy apps should.

A phone number can link you to A LOT. Location, bills, accounts, etc. Is that not private info? Not to mention your cellphone company, who gives you the number, has a lot about you on file."
Muting pinned messages?;2;kdf0hd;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kdf0hd/muting_pinned_messages/;7;"Hello,

I'm a member of many groups on Telegram that I wish to keep muted.

However, whenever an admin pins a message (and that happens often) it ignores the settings and sends a notification, and that drives me crazy sometimes.

Is there a solution? If not can someone make a feature request?";2020-12-15 07:46:28;"Yes I’d like that, too. Hmmm... I don't personally remember getting notified from muted groups, but assuming nothing was overlooked and this is still happening; Wouldn't assigning a silent sound file for notification and turning off message preview for the offending groups work just as well? on android, you can disable it and on Android X, you can disable it per chat [deleted] Maybe the admins of these groups don't pin many messages.  


Anyway that work around will not work and I find it pretty sad this is the solution instead of proper notification handling by the UI and the devs.

&#x200B;

In Telegram X btw, this didn't happen, but looks like they forgot about that project and it was missing too many features so I switched back to vanilla. Maybe you should check out messages before you post.

I don't want to turn off pinned messages completely.  
I want to mute them only for specific groups. They do so fairly regularly, actually. So for me, muting is working as intended - but I  I don't know why things are different for you (or perhaps, why things are different for me). I was just offering that as a possible workaround. 

But if you don't mind me asking, why wouldn't this workaround work? If should cut off notification from any given group."

Protecting company privacy on Telegram;34;kd4xw1;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kd4xw1/protecting_company_privacy_on_telegram/;40;"My company uses Telegram alongside email for work communication. Recently we've had to terminate an employee for maliciously violating confidentiality. Their access to email has been cut off (granted they can probably access old emails if they were using an email client). The next step will be to delete them from all company Telegram groups they were a part of. The problem, however, is that even if we delete them from the groups, they'd still have access to all past company discussions which contains sensitive information about clients, projects, etc.   


We are certain that the terminated employee has malicious intent to damage the company by making private internal discussions public. Is there a way to prevent this from happening? At this point we are contemplating nuking all of our groups which should delete the conversation history from all members. Sadly, if we do that we'd probably also move to another platform as this incident has opened management's eyes with regards to the potential risk exposed by using Telegram for work communications.";2020-12-14 22:48:28;"For your company to keep the data, and to cut access to it for that employee, one of those group admins should export their contents using Telegram Desktop, delete all messages in them, than those groups all together, and create them back, without that employee. Personally, I won’t recommend for your company to switch from Telegram, as unlike other platforms, it has the best implementation of data export and deletion for those emergency situations If a member of a supergroup is removed, they will lose access to all messages Steps to improve group security:

Step 1. Check if, when you click delete on a message, there is the option whether to delete just for you or for everyone. If this option is there, you are in a normal group and not a supergroup.

Step 2, optional. If you are in a normal group, and you kick someone, the chat will remain saved on their device. The only thing you can do is to delete everything and click ""delete for everyone"" on every message. This is tedious but could be accomplished with a userbot.

Step 3. Turn the group into a supergroup. To do this, pin a message in the group. (right click a message and click pin) The group will change categories and from then on, anyone who is kicked from the group will have all the chat's contents be immediately unavailable to them.

Note: as another commenter said. If the attacker is truly malicious, is smart and truly has the intention to keep company information and expose it, they can export the chat and save it for offline access, or forward every message they want to keep into another chat.

Telegram can be an excellent tool for granular control over your sensitive information. However, not everything can be controlled afterwards if you were careless before. Many things need precautions that range from the type of chat you create (group, supergroup, channel, secret chat), the type of messages you send (self-destructing, forwardable), the rights you give people (see full message history, see only new messages), where and which people you invite to each group, and even user settings such as whether people can click your forwarded messages to go to your chat, who can see your phone number, profile picture, and what name you use. Ultimately, it is up to a smart administrator to use the tools well. If they are not used well, or course, they will fail you. Using Telegram for sensitive company conversations is a bad idea. if you remove someone from a group, the group disappears for this person. he/she cant see old messages. you can also delete messages for both parties in private chats and the other person can't do anything to get them back. Just do it and move to something business-oriented. This is exactly what e.g. Slack solves. In this regard, everything else isn't much different. Any information that landed on client side at least once, could be saved/backed up somewhere where you won't be able to delete it. If the attacker really wanted that info, you may assume it's already saved, and prepare for the worst. >We are certain that the terminated employee has malicious intent to damage the company by making private internal discussions public. Is there a way to prevent this from happening? 

Yes, but it's not a technical answer, it's a legal one: you need to lawyer up ASAP.  Explain to counsel what you know about the employee, and they will advise you on what your legal options are for during/before/after such a thing happens. In the future, you should check out platforms such as Wickr Pro or Wire. They’re meant specifically for businesses and as such have certain features that would help out in this situation. Also, if you decide to keep using telegram, consider having employees use work only telegram accounts for work. They can keep both accounts on one device, if an employee leaves you can delete the whole account and it allows for much more compartmentalization. If am not mistaken, there is a ban option as well, wherein then the member doesn't has access to the group and can't see it in their chat list. [deleted] What is a supergroup? I was removed(or kicked, dunno which one) from a regular group and it disappeared. I recommended Telegram to management about 6 years ago when the company was still relatively small and we used it for basic weekly updates. That use has changed over the years and the staff size has grown significantly. At one point I did try Slack but couldn't convince management to pay for a product when we had a perfectly working solution already implemented, at no cost. A monthly recurring cost that was likely to increase over time was seen as a very unattractive investment. I'd say using any form of communication that can be easily screenshotted/recorded automatically means they can be compromised. Not that much of a problem for a company, depending on *how* sensitive the conversations are, but a lot of people have this idea that leaks are an outside threat only. They're an inside one as well. Are you sure? Because we tested it and the message history is still there. We know that the future messages won't appear but we're also concerned about the past data. I agree, plus with Matrix/Element, the decentralization allows you to host your own server for power management for stuff like this I wouldn't recommend Wire. It's buggy as hell and the developers are incredibly unresponsive to user feedback. There are issues on their Github dating back years, which *never* get fixed.

Source: Used Wire for several years before giving up waiting for things to be fixed and moved all my contacts onto Telegram instead. When a group is created, it is a normal group by default. If you are kicked, you still keep it on your device. However, if anyone in that group makes someone an admin or pins a message, the group gets turned into a supergroup. If someone is kicked from a supergroup, that group and its contents become unavailable to that user, and it is removed from their device.

This comes from an era where groups and supergroups where two completely different things. But now groups can become supergroups by themselves depending on what the admins do. This group was ~~created before super groups were introduced, and was~~ never converted to a super group, right?  (edit: It's been pointed out to me that when the group was created doesn't matter.. All groups start out as normal group) Normal group has this problem where messages were stored locally.

Unfortunately, There is no way in your situation to correct this problem - even if you made the conversion now, every message sent before the conversion would still be stored locally. Similarly, nuking the room now would also have no effect on current participants of the group's ability to access messages sent from before.  It would not delete conversation history from everyone.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/4yp216/qa\_after\_conversion\_to\_supergroup\_are\_messages/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/4yp216/qa_after_conversion_to_supergroup_are_messages/)

This is largely the fault of your group moderator. They really should have converted the group to super group when they were introduced. Still, to minimize damage going forward, your company should convert your group to super group NOW, so that at least any future messages would be controlled globally. i was removed from a group 2months ago and I couldnt find it anymore. i tried searching for it, for individual messages - nothing showed up. How exactly did you test? You removed someone from the group? And this person can still see it and the old messages too? Is there any other option like ban or something like that or it's only ""remove""? oh do u want to delete all the messages sent by him in group? This is THE best answer out here.
I'll too recommend supergroup conversion.. Nuke the group and dump the guy off, since there's nothing that can be done for an unconverted group..
Supergroup conversion should be the first thing you do on the new group. [deleted] Yes we tested removing someone from a group and the person was still able to see the group with a notice that they'd been removed from the group. All past messages were visible. To be clear this was tested with the Android client. No, I want to ensure that they cannot access any past content posted in the group. Currently, if you remove someone from a group, they can view all past content still. u/DontBuyMeGoldGiveBTC 's [post further down this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kd4xw1/protecting_company_privacy_on_telegram/gfwaen2/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) details how you can check if your group is normal group or Supergroup.

There used to be an option to change your group to a Supergroup, but I guess that is gone... So the only way would be to meet any of the following conditions (at which point Telegram will automatically convert your group):

1. Make the group public
2. Change history visibility of the group.
3. Change any permission setting for any user (including admins)
4. Pin any message to the top
5. Have 201 or more members. You can have up to 200,000 members.

The change is also not reversible. Once you do any of these five things, it will always stay a Supergroup even if you reverse the change that triggered the conversion. Maybe Telegram changed it. Is there any other option besides ""remove user""? Something like kick, ban? https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-use-of-kick-in-the-Telegram-app If there is 'kick', add this person again and kick him/her. No that's not true if someone gets removed, they can't see anything in the group. Is youe group a public group or a private one? If it is a public group he can see its post with a different account without joining. If it is a private group he will not be able to view group posts without joining, but to join he has to have the invite link, so revoke  the group link if it is private Thanks, I'll check to see if there's a kick option According to the quora link, the group creator can do it. The group is private, right? I'll have to test it. I'm reading conflicting info about banning, online. Yes the group is private I think at a certain amount of members the group is considered a super group when it's not members are notified when they are removed from a group, I did the test it with someone I was the only member, and it said that I got removed from the group I could still see the content... I hated this function cause I did removed before this test some people that I didn't trust and when I found out how it worked I was a bit upset A group can turn into a supergroup by pinning a message and by making a user an admin of the group. But I’d figure a company Telegram group definitely uses all those options already so... It's not one group. They have multiple groups. My bet is some are supergroups and some aren't. I personally make a new group for every project I have, even if the people inside are already in another group. Oh, that’s probably the case. Well, they should definitely check that all the groups are supergroups and kick that person out then. Easy beazy."

Thanks for the link too. I can see how it's supposed to work. Thanks for the answer! then you should have mentioned that; whenever you ask someone for advice, make sure to describe your problem well, it helps everyone Thanks for the tip, though I am familiar with how trouble shooting works, If I had information that would have been helpful, I definitely would have shared it. Maybe saying that clicking it does nothing would have helped someone know what it is, but I'm not sure how. it helps by showing that at least you’ve tried; people on tech forums/subs generally won’t be eager to help those who does nothing and goes asking questions straight away I guess that's fair. As I'm active, and help people on tech subs myself, I guess I assumed it was pretty straight forward to ask if anyone recognized an icon and was pretty different from someone asking for someone else to write some code for them when they didn't put effort in."

If it says that someone has indeed logged in, and not just requesting the code, immediately terminate that session. Telegram sends warnings to all your active sessions when a new one is started for this scenario. And, yeah, 2FA is just as important, it stops this kind of attack. Thanks! I was also trying to understand potential motive for so many logins. Like are they using the number to do some other malicious work? Have asked her to get rid of this number as well. So the strange thing is that I checked but she didn't get those login messages. Like where it says that a new login has been detected from xyz IP address.

When you create a group, by default, it's private and undiscoverable. You can add a member yourself and it will stay private. The only way it becomes publicly accessible is if you go into the group's options and either create a private link and share it or make it into a public group and assign a username. The group can only be found in search if specifically made public and given a username.
2. P2P means after establishing the connection for the call, it switches to not using the server to route the call traffic. This can be useful at improving quality if you're far from a server but if your connection is unstable then it won't affect it unfortunately."

EDIT: Just tested with a friend. The other person won't be able to read. Thank god.";2020-12-13 16:30:36;"It depends on if Chat History For New Members is turned on or off.If you keep it off, even if you don’t delete them, members joining the group won’t see those messages.
If you keep chat history enabled for new members, however, I’m pretty sure it’ll show those messages to new members, if they were deleted just for you. But don’t quote me on that. No, also you can change group setting so new member couldn't see messages before they entered. I don't know because that's an awfully specific use case. But I would recommend you to test this. Find a friend and test this on a brand new group to be sure. Since when does telegram have option to delete messages just for yourself in a group? uh, no. Especially because when you delete sth in a group is deleted for everybody Why tho? If I didn't delete for everyone shouldn't  this person be able to read them? Have you personally tested this?  


Sorry for the intense questions, it's important. What do you mean why?

They’ve told you there is a setting for it. You test it now to satisfy your own concerns. I test it, if you delete your message, it will deleted for everyone unlike whatsapp."

How does telegram's unlimited storage not get abused by competitors?;48;kbzb3s;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/kbzb3s/how_does_telegrams_unlimited_storage_not_get/;17; I find it hard to believe that telegram's unlimited storage was never exploited by rivals. How does Telegram deal with that? Are there limitations to users?;2020-12-13 02:17:57;"There's no limitations AFAIK.

There's even a solution that exploits this storage (link to Russian-language resource): [https://habr.com/ru/company/vds/blog/456290/](https://habr.com/ru/company/vds/blog/456290/) throttling and rate limiting In my experience, there is no way to exploit this. It is painfully slow. The bandwidth allowed is about 10Mbps per account (at least in my experience). It doesn’t matter if your are uploading on Telegram Desktop and sending another file through your phone. The bandwidth allowed will be shared between devices. So there’s a very little chance to exploit the unlimited storage Never is a strong word.

And I personally believe that Telegram has had instances where they nuked data from their servers to free up spaces. I don't know, I have uploaded some 150GB ""study material""  during this lockdown :P there is not a limit but it doesn't mean you can abuse it, they will probably delete your account or limit your download/upload Same question can be applied to Facebook. There are bots here that post every 12 000 frames of certain animated movies and nobody seems to care. I wonder how much of FB's storage is filled with literal junk, let alone shitposting. I'd bet something around 50%.

' Hahahaha, damnnn, the balls on this dude, and it's pretty good software too. I wonder how many people use this or equivalents. I've thought before that it's possible to host websites on Telegram using similar systems. What does this do, exactly? I've seen up to ~300mbit/s here. I wud love to have your study materials collection. 😜 Facebook adds storage multiple times a day for this reason I think, in the article it's explained more clearly than I can do.

It adds telegram storage as a file system to your linux environment lol, I have 600Mbps and never hit more than 1 or 2MB/s uploading to telegram. (About 10Mbps) You must be at Telegram HQ, lol. How You. mean a VFS using telegram cloud, this unlimited storage?"

You can select the text and right clicking on it or simply put the double symbols after and before text.

  


For example \_\_ for italic \_\_

\*\* bold \*\* Can you give an example? I can do multiple style in tdesktop just fine Keyboard shortcuts or applying style through the right click menu always replaces the style, doesn't add it.

The symbols work the same way. Only one style is applied. See here: https://ibb.co/vBkP9g4 When I apply italic and then bold, for example, it just makes the text bold replacing italic. Can't apply multiple styles to text.

I'm on Win 7 Pro and Telegram 2.4.7. It's been like this always for me.

You say you can do this on the desktop app?? You can, for example, make text underlined AND bold AND italic??? If you can, then I don't get what's happening here. Oh I get you. You can't have a word be both bold *and* italic.  One or the other I see. You're right, that's not possible on tdesktop. Yeah. It's weird that the mobile app can do this, but not the desktop. Just WEIRD. It's not like it's some kind of complex functionality. Like the devs actually forcing users to use the mobile app. Any idea why?? Probably because it's not yet implemented. You can just post a request issue on their github repo. That's my question. Why something this simple would not be implemented.

Whatever. Telegram lacks development resources it needs to keep up with it's usability. Yeah, it's better than many alternatives, but just not good enough for serious use. Features that are being implemented don't make sense too often. Instead of fixing what really should be fixed, they add unnecessary stuff, wasting resources.

It's usability for me doesn't go further than just a messenger. I hope when Matrix protocol becomes truly distributed to migrate there. Or something similar/better. Centralized communication dependent on someone providing it is not really something to..depend on. It's 21st century for f's sake.

Just a small rant. Thanks."

Note: This happens the most when there's text in the picture.";2020-12-12 07:24:14;"Send them as files, not pictures. don’t send long images like scrolling screenshots, Telegram’s compression makes it unreadable. On Android, attach > file > gallery

If you send as a general file it won't be compressed, you won't be able to see a thumbnail but again, no compression. Instead of uploading directly from images, upload them as files you can adjust the quality while sending, there will be  a slider. Just wanted to remind everyone that if you send a photo without compression, or as a file as many people are suggesting, it will contain all EXIF data stored with the photo. That includes location data if your photos were tagged with it when taken. That's just my normal picture size whenever I take a picture on my phone. A slider? I've never seen anything like that while sending. The slider is for video uploads. Unfortunately not (yet?) available for photos."

Would that be harder to watch if someone hacked your phone?;2020-12-10 21:23:54;"If someone has full access to your phone then he has full access to your data...

https://xkcd.com/538/ Depending on how much security and privacy you want, here are the options (listed from the most to least secure):

1. Signal: data stays on phone and always encrypted
2. Telegram secret chat: same as Signal, but your profile is identifiable 
3. Telegram normal chat: data is not encrypted, but out of government's hands

In case your phone is totally compromised, there isn't any solution other than resetting or discarding the phone.

Despite all being said, there is a risk of being identifiable through relationship analysis. I recommend the following YouTube video for more information:

https://youtu.be/IWMZ17Iyu3o Bro, all these secure messaging softwares are only as secure as your devices. If you got hacked, these apps don’t mean shit, your data is highly likely to be accessible by hackers, especially the ones in your cloud. normal telegram chats are also encrypted; just not e2e encrypted. ...how can your data be out of government hands or anyone's hands if unencrypted?

At any rate, one's telegram data is in the hands of telegram's creator. what do you mean when you say "" out of government's hand?

do you mean that government can't see our conversations or can hack our chats? They are obviously encrypted. Just not end to end but on the servers. Indeed, your data is in their hands, but it is out of government hands. True. We are living on the mercy of the developers for not going rouge or turning to the dark side. I assume that means legally they can't use the data in court without a warrant. Which telegram had never issued. So it would be illegal Telegram regular chats are not encrypted Going fabulously rouge or nefariously rogue. They are encrypted in Telegram servers. They are not stored or transmitted in plain text... Anyone with the decryption key can read them, and there are indeed moderators who check even private groups for illegal content, but that doesn't mean that it's unencrypted/plain text."

Steps to ensure that the contacts you deleted stays deleted are detailed in this post. Have your friend follow this procedure and see if that changes anything.

I’ve deleted and re-added his contact on my phone and Telegram as well. I guess this is a glitch beyond our control. Thanks for your advice! Did they also delete  you from their telegram contacts? And do they have their profile picture and last seen set to contacts only? Yes, they did and only show profile and last seen to contacts. Which is why we’re confused. Oh I turned reddit notifications off sorry, this is a bit weird. Have you solved already? If he sets anyone can see pfp do you keep seeing it or not? No worries, all good. We haven’t solved it, I can always see his last seen, unless he chooses to share it with nobody. Same with seeing his number. Are you the only non-contact who can see them anyway?

\#2. nahhh there is no way  


\#3, screenshots are blocked when you are in a secret chat with someone, or when you are in a regular DM and the other user sent you a timed media not sure about #1 and #2 but for #3 I believe screenshots are blocked only in secret chats not the normal chat. I just wanna clarify #1 for everyone, because so many people keep saying that this is only possible if you use a new phone number. 

**THAT IS NOT TRUE. ** Stop spreading outdated information and confusing the newbies. 

In fact, it's been possible to use Telegram with your number without notifying people who have your number for over a year now. This is the blog post that explains that update. 

https://telegram.org/blog/scheduled-reminders-themes (Scroll to the section ""new privacy settings"")

So.. OP, to do what you want, 

* First, DO NOT sync your contacts when you first sign-in. If you did, you will want to delete synced contacts first. 
* Then, you need to go to Settings > Privacy > Phone Number and set ""Who can see my phone number"" to ""Nobody"". 
* This unlocks another setting ""Who can find me by my number"", which you would set to ""My contacts""

After this, nobody will be notified of your presence on Telegram, as you will only be discoverable by someone in your contact list, which will be empty after step 1. From here, you just manually add people you want to maintain contact with on Telegram. 1. People who have your phone number will always see that you have Telegram. Unless you block them manually. Or if you have a phone number that nobody has.
2. No; from the pov of Telegram, it's just a picture.
3. Only in secret chats. Those have some ups (e2e encrypted, self-destruct timer, no screenshots,...) and downs (not on the cloud -> only available on the device it was created, unable to create/read one from desktop,...). 1. Don't sync contacts. Others who have your number will get a notification about you joining Telegram. You cannot prevent this, though others might have decided to disable this notification for their side.

2. No. You get the image, that's it. There is no way to tell whether it was taken then and there, or chosen from the gallery. If they have seng the image as a file instead of a photo, you might be able to check the EXIF data which Telegram usually strips of photos.

3. Screenshots are only blocked in secret chats that are fully end-to-end encrypted. 1. Settings > Privacy > disable find by phone number

2. Well, that's possible with any app given the image has untampered data.

You can try this by opening some image you've taken in google photos > details

3. I beleive this was answered quite well by others 1. People on your contact list will know if you join Telegram, if you don't want them to know you have to join Telegram using a different phone number they have not saved
2. No, there is not
3. No, they are not blocked. However if you use secret chats you will be notified if the other party takes a screenshot. Keep in mind nothing can stop the other party from taking a picture of the screen using another camera . 1- Yes, you need a different number. If not, the contacts who have your number in their telephone agenda will see you in their agenda on telegram.
2- There is no thing that warns you about this. If it existed, could be against privacy.
3- Yes, this can be enabled. For Secret Chats is default. For all the app you need to enable in privacy settings, in android is something like privacy>password>show content. Screen shots are not block, it tells you a screen shot was taken. So even if I don't give telegram permission to access my contacts, and even if I disable the sync contacts setting in the options, they can still see if I joined telegram if they have my number??? That depends on your android version.
On newer android devices, it blocks that, on older it can't block it, so it just tells you, that one was taken. Yes, because people who have your number in their contact list will see your number in Telegram Your intuition is right. Don't give it permission to access contacts, and Telegram won't reveal you to each other. I can't believe how many people here are saying otherwise when it simply doesn't work like that. exactly, thanks. yeah like honestly i will test this out personally myself with my moms phone i will install telegram on her phone and NOT give it permission to access her contacts at first just to see if it will still show up on her phone that i have telegram or vice versa, then imma give permission to contacts on her phone see what happens then, cause honestly i think as long as you don't give telegram permission to access ur contact list i don't think there is anyway how they would know or get notified that you joined telegram. but anything is possible i could be wrong Denying access to the contact list has no effect on that notification. The point is if someone who is in my contact list joins Telegram I will see the notification because I have his number saved in my Telegram app The point is if the person has your contact, they'll be notified. Not if you have their contact. So revoking contacts access has no effect. The example you gave is the opposite of what you want, your mom's phone will be the new account so you have to check if YOU get notified (you will, if you have her contact, no matter if she gave contacts permission or not). If a person has your phone number in their TG contacts when your phone number registers for TG, it notifies them that you are now on TG. It doesn't matter what you have done with your own contacts.

Once you sign up, you can set your phone number to only be visible to people in your TG contacts. Once set like this, if anyone tries to message your phone number that isn't in your TG contacts, it will act as if your phone number doesn't use TG and asks if you'd like to invite them to join."

Thus backup doesn't touch them, and they are not on the cloud server, like other chats.
This is absolutely necessary for security and privacy purposes. If the secret key and secret chats could move around, the sense of secret would be over. With that, you're absolutely sure only you can read the content. Gotcha. Gotcha. Thanks Makes total sense. Thank you!"

Did you check the telegram folder? And the one in android/data folder Similar thread from a few days ago, maybe you can find some clues there: https://redd.it/k89lr1 That is used in telegram protected storage, the other app cannot access it without root your phone. You see the 2nd screenshot, already cleared all telegram cache. Checked, nothing inside. I can only uninstall and reinstall to clear the storage. But after few days, it becomes like this again, it only happens on the latest version 7.2.1 Android's size stats do not count Telegram's cache folder (that is, the directory where most medias are downloaded when the app downloads them). I explained how android size stats work in relation to Telegram in another comment a few days ago: https://old.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/k89lr1/why_does_telegram_taku_so_much_space_after/gexb4sw/

For how long have you had Telegram installed in your phone? Seems it's the pagination file cost the space? I noticed this issue last week, and tried uninstall and reinstall again, then the issue solved, but the next day it again showed 12GB usage, now it's 19GB plus, although the telegram internal storage shows nothing. The funny part it's we cannot clear data for telegram in Android setting. It's just a redirect to the telegram internal storage management. The only way to regain the storage is uninstall and reinstall. And this issue only happens after upgrade to the latest telegram version 7.2.1. I have been using telegram for few years already. Never encountered such issue before, I tried to contact telegram support, but no response from them. > The only way to regain the storage is uninstall and reinstall.

Yep, that's the only way to remove that pagination file. Some people say that using the option to clean your messages database (from Telegram's settings) several times will eventually delete that file too but I've never tried"

I haven’t heard anything Several years ago  Apple has required Telegram to disable in-app games (despite letting Facebook and other companies have it), threatening with deleting the app from the store. 

Also, they have delayed reviewing some of the tg updates in the past, leading to iOS users getting new features later than Android users. They outright asked them to censor certain political channels and groups used by Belarusian protesters, while it's not a requirement for any other social media app on their platform. I remember that they've also blocked telegram updates for a while, haven't they? In-app games are back on iOS (in bots like Gamee) That might be because the groups on other social media are pretty paltry compared to Telegram's, which are singled out as the main tool for people organizing protests. So the Belarus state asked Apple to push those out specifically and Apple agreed, like a good little lapdog."

Sites to search for new channels, groups, etc...;6;k9rwot;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/k9rwot/sites_to_search_for_new_channels_groups_etc/;5;"Hi!

I'm searching sites to search new telegram channels, groups and bots.

Any advise?";2020-12-09 16:34:35;"Bump. I'm also interested in resources to find English-language channels. I'm in the same boat. I decided to take another crack at Telegram's channels & groups to see if there was any way to use the app as more than a messenger, but honestly search is impossible. The app's channel search capability is so limited it's barely functional; you need to know the name of the channel you're searching for, which makes discovery impossible.

Most of the online directories I've found are spam, SEO farms, and porn.

Posting here in case we're all missing something. I used to just type telegram groups or such in duckduckgo and find them. Otherwise I just search in telegram itself yes but I refer to literally discover new private channels & groups, to see what they can offer to me. Hmm that's difficult as sometimes they are private and invite only. If you can do a large search for specific words then just do that would be my opinion.

Ether that or just click random links but you would have a limit of how much you can click a hour last I checked."

Thanks in advance for any insight.";2020-12-08 23:23:10;"It seems Keepa created a temporary Telegram login code. The link you got is personalized with the code after "" ?start="".
With the ?start= addition in a telegram link, you are able to start a specific bot action. In this case, it's the login into your account. Another use case is for example importing a quiz in the official telegram quiz not.

I'm not an expert in these things, but I think that's what's happening here. Bot sent you a tracked link, you opened it and then it automatically logged in your Keepa account because you had cookies in your browser AH! Didn't notice that. Makes sense to me... thank you a lot :) Happy cake day! Yup, that's certainly the correct explanation. There's nothing cookie-related happening here. It's entirely to do with that `start` parameter in the URL, which sends the value to the bot after the `/start` command (which is hidden from the user). You can't if the link wasn't shown to you, it is hidden behind the the start but not visible"

Best Regards";2020-12-08 17:50:00;"You are talking abt creating a new account or adding ur existing account to the new phone? If it’s abt existing account you’ll get verification code in the device you have logged in. As far as I remeber, if you don't enter the SMS code within 2 minutes, Telegram will show you an option to receive a call instead. I don't know if that's the case during the creation of an account too if you can’t receive SMS, TG calls you and tells you the code if you don’t input the code within 2 minutes. but if you can’t receive texts or voice calls, you’re SOL. Thanks for your answer!

New Telegram Account to an existing phone, which I can only use for LTE Internet Access, but not for communication by regular Voice & SMS services! 

This is a special bulk tariff with ""unlimited"" GB  Data transmission per month at a very low fee level ...!  

It is recommended in case you are able to use TWIN Sim Cards in a single phone (e.g. Samsung S9+  ...) or your are using two phones  in parallel (as I do with two S9+), one for mobile phoning primarily with limited data per month and the  other S9+ for data only - but unlimited GB LTE Internet Access. 

For the last one now I want to activate Telegram too.

Best Regards If u r not bothered abt using your own phone number then u could make use of any free VoIP service with sms service. Thanks for this advice, I will think about it.

At the moment I am still looking for an officially supported method.

I have already used the first S9+ and its working SMS functionality  to get Telegram authorized on the second S9+. 

Telegram advises, that the phone number (after SMS notfication) generally is not relevant for proper working of Telegram.  

I have  learned-  YES for basic messaging functionality this seems to be right - but some Bot functionality does not work on the second S9+ (which works fine on the first S9+). Now I am unsure, whether I did a Bot programming mistake or the non-straight Telegram activation is the root cause for the bot hickup.

Abuse takes things seriously but to not reply is abnormal. Have you tried going to the authorities? Not sure where you’re from but CyberCrime departments have ways. Maybe abuse would also respond faster to you if you have a report. perhaps you can send a DMCA notice to dmca@telegram.org? Every day someone posts here that telegram doesn't respond to anything. Looks like all mails they get are automatically moved to the trash 😂

The only responses I have seen are on twitter. oh my. I'm sorry for what happened.

mass reporting from multiple users could work, but I'd strongly suggest you contact the authorities as well, as they can get in touch with the software platform in a privileged manner. After all those who are responsible for this are committing a crime Telegram will not do what you are trying to make them do. Sorry. They just do not respond to those types of requests for groups, only channels.

If you are unwilling to contact your local authorities then there is nothing you can do here for the groups. You can file a DMCA for the channels if you are the person who took the photos or have been authorized to do so by the person who took the photos. (Being the subject of the photo does *not* make you the copyright owner.) Directly contact them on twitter, don't dm, tweet to them. Post the link, we'll like the tweet, so that telegram would actually reply. You have pornography of yourself? How did they get ahold of it in the first place? A group with over 120 Thousand memebers? Where's the group in reference? Thanks for bringing that up. I just added some additional information and that explains why going to the authorities is not an option, it simply won't work. But seriously, abuse never replied to my email, which I always send them with the link of the content and the link of the group/channel. Or can I simply send them a long email explaining my situation? Will they even look at it? I am also guessing that abuse doesn't reply to me since telegram made it clear that they do not process content removal request against ""private"" groups or chats. But seriously, those groups have up to hundreds of thousands of members and hundreds of people join the groups every single day. How come this kind of groups considered ""private"" if that really is the reason they are not replying. I did, along with the link of the infringing information and the link of the group. But still haven't received any reply. I did try tweet and comment below their tweets, maybe I shouldn't have put my account in protected mode. Thanks for the advice. For now, my only hope is the telegram abuse team. I am willing to contact local authority. It is just that I am 99.9% sure it won't make any difference. Some of those that I reported are channels, but still nothing happened. u/AlexWexr tweeting is good advice, but posting the link is very bad, because it may easily help the spreading of the content that must be removed. I did tweet to them, but I don't think I am allowed to share the link here.(tweet link) Or can I? I wish I knew. I don't think I am allowed to share the link here. I’m not sure of your laws, but at the very least your authorities can advise you. Here in Singapore we just had a large private group shut down, and the court has charged the admins https://www.asiaone.com/digital/what-sg-nasi-lemak-inside-telegram-chat-group-circulating-local-nsfw-content

Though stated in the article, while a police report was made, it’s unclear if the authorities had anything to do with the group’s closure. was it drafted up by a lawyer? i don’t think a normal email will work, so you might need one with legal backing No, I mean, the tweet link. Not the actual content link. It helps expose the group, and could help others take it down. What is the reservation about sharing the links? This takes away exposure about the actual group, hinders discussion about the service, and defeats the function of this site to share links. *What is* the motivation of not allowing links to there? >[https://www.asiaone.com/digital/what-sg-nasi-lemak-inside-telegram-chat-group-circulating-local-nsfw-content](https://www.asiaone.com/digital/what-sg-nasi-lemak-inside-telegram-chat-group-circulating-local-nsfw-content)

I mean spreading non-consensual nudity is probably illegal everywhere, including China. However, telegram is not ""officially"" running here, just like google and Twitter, but still, we can access all these using a VPN. And that could also be the main reason why authorities cannot really do anything here, they don't usually deal with those platforms. Not really, but telegram states in their FAQ that being a copyright owner is sufficient enough to send them a complaint if I am understanding them correctly. Also, it went well when I sent a DMCA to google for some search results. But thanks for that advice, I'll certainly consider doing that, except that it could be challenging for me to find an appropriate lawyer. I don't know but it is one of the rules here. I'm afraid my post will be removed if I am sharing the link. I wish I could do that."

Looking for a telegram client similar to telegram X;22;k8qxyq;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/k8qxyq/looking_for_a_telegram_client_similar_to_telegram/;32;"Hi. I used to use Telegram X when it was the next big thing, but switched to regular telegram when the X stopped being updated. Today I downloaded Telegram X again and absolutely fell in love with the UI. Now I am on a hunt for a telegram client (that is being updated on a regular basis with new features and stuff) that has a similar look and feel to the Telegram X.

P.S. I don't quite know what exactly I like about it's interface

Thank you all in advance and marry Christmas!";2020-12-08 01:19:57;"don’t think one exists, since all the third party clients on Android are based off the official app. there’s Unigram, which is similar, but that’s only for W10 I'm sure this will never happen, because, telegram x is a trusted app by telegram, so, by using a third party app, you should trust them with your information

Even if they exist, I would recommend staying with the official apps I am in the same boat.  I love the X's UI, but its inability of streaming videos is just really annoying at times. Check out catogram i don't see any difference in ui, what are you talking about?
upd: probably there are a few, but they are so small. the telegram ux is constantly updated and you will never experience the same with third party apps or something official, but still aside like telegram x Sólo quédate con la App original There is 100% a place in the market for a slim line, basic, no dancing cats version of Telegram.   One that works on legacy devices (I know it runs on old devices atm but for how long).   Telegram X has been an answer for a longtime. i loved telegram x UI but...does anybody know what happened to its development team? Hi.  It's different Just wait few more month, probable than the new update to Telegram X would come out Try our Graph messenger. It's probably from developers from Iran but it's quite famous and looks good. 

It has a lot of additional features over the official application. When I mean a lot of, it's a ton of extra features, more than any other third party client IMO. It brought in folders before the official client.

It also gives you a lot of options to customize your theme so you might be able to find out what you want.

And yes, it's updated regularly, within few days of the official updates. 

It shows a banner ad at the top of the chats though, but doesn't annoy me. Android :-  
Nekogram X  
Catogram  
Nekogram Plus Messenger is highly customizable, and highly themable. It also has countless features that stock Telegram doesn't have (message interaction on tap has 2 to 3 times as many options). I guess, just find a theme that looks kinda like Telegram X, and delete the buttons you don't like? There are hundreds of mod options and an active support chat if you were to need help.

It is also regularly updated (today was the latest update). Newest stock Telegram features are usually adopted within a week or so. Of course, the features you are looking for will be found in the Telegram Plus version or the so-called Messenger Plus, where you will find various options for customizing themes and icons .. Explore the updated version of the application with a direct download link from here 👇

https://www.alarabydownloads.com/telegram-plus-apk-android/ Plus Messenger is a pretty neat & customisable alternative client for Telegram. Obviously I would look into the code (if it were to be available) of the app I were to use. And it the code weren't available - I just wouldn't use it And the lack of folders is annoying as hell What's it main advantage over the stock application? *I don't see any*

*Difference in ui, what are*

*You talking about?*

Don't speak Spanish (?) Sorry While I agree - it is too basic, or outdated for me. I don't care about video calls and such, but the folder function is very important to me Most of.it has been switched to a normal telegram app. The idea of telegram X was that it was written in a native language (like swift for ios or kotlin for android I believe). And that was eventually implemented into a normal telegram app. So the team was mostly switched to a regular telegram. But as far as I know the x is still being developed and updated, although extremely slowly AND closed source, unless something has changed recently. i don't use channels so i didn't notice this. actually, i like this one, but all the other things feel sort of out of place imho. just feels like old version of tg Just stay in the original app. Nothing will give you more stability and security. Also, if you want, you can customize its appearance. yeah that happened on iOS, I'm on android...telegram main app looks like it's from 2014 but telegram x was more beautiful and had much better animations I didn't see any open source requirement in the OP. Yeah, I know. But it doesn't quite look the way the x version does I just pointed it out, in case OP cared. I didn't downvote you. Alright :)"

Why does Telegram taku so much space after clearing the cache (videos, photo, etc..);37;k89lr1;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/gallery/k89lr1;26;[deleted];2020-12-07 07:28:08;"[removed] Domanda stupida: hai provato a disinstallare e reinstallare l'app? Telegram's built-in data management tool will show you the size of your `Telegram` cache directory in your internal storage, which isn't considered by Android's size stats.

That 1.21 GB of data are stuff stored in a different place in your internal storage (`Android/data/org.telegram.messenger/files/` (probably empty if you have downloaded the app from the store) and `Android/data/org.telegram.messenger/cache/`) and in the app's protected directory (`/data/data/org.telegram.messenger/files/`, that can be access only if your phone is rooted).

_I think_ you can safely delete the data in the first two directories I mentioned (as someone already pointed out, it's cached profiles pictures, cached animated stickers, parts of unfinished streamings and some other things). As for the data in the app's internal directory, I'm afraid you can't do much. It contains cached localizations and themes, but what takes most of the space there is your local database (the one you can shrink from telegram's storage settings). The size Telegram shows you is the size of its internal database file, but telegram doesn't count a database pagination file which might be times the size of the actual database (for example, my database is less than 100 MB but the pagination file is almost 1 GB). You can't do anything to delete this file (except for uninstalling and reinstalling the app) unless you have root access. Some people say that using the option to clear your local database from Telegram's storage settings will eventually clean this file too, so it's worth trying to use it a few times in a row to see if it helps Telegram saves files which you downloaded in a separate file than the one's saved on the device.
Go to your file manager and Android (i don't know about ios) there will be a file for telegram (something   . Chalegram) and it has all the files and profile pics of people you ever saw. Deleting those may help you.

It can built up over time, there’s nothing you can do except leave the groups. if someone can confirm: in my case i traced that a lot of space was wasted due to something creating the thumbnails for the stuff i saw with the @ gif tag. Half a gigabyte usually at least that wasnt considered as cache somehow Reduce cache retain time in telegram settings- storage or disable auto download. yes i did 10-11 times already because the app keep to return to 1.3gb used, in 2 hours yes, and after 2 hours it came back to 1.2gb. i already did it 6-7 times, and i am sick of it can i ask to telegram to find a solution to it or something? my settigs allow only the automatic download of images ONLY in channels You can log out and then log in.

If you want to reduce the amount of data Telegram stores offline, change your settings. 

Go to Settings > Data and Storage > Storage Usage and bring down the number of days you want Telegram to store data. Keep it for 3 days and it should bring the data size to minimum.

You can clear Telegram cache on this page and I guess it should do the job! Local Database can take up alot of space. Logging out clears that. Then you can log in again i already cleared all the photos, videos etc.. but telegram continue to take 1.2 gb"

Or he can unarchive it manually.

It's really not a big deal. Thanks for the quick reply. So, if I were to message rn (and not be read just delivered), when he reopens the app, all the messages will return? 

And perhaps not to you and your chats, but we're in a long distance international relationship and this is our only history documented. I planned on building part of our anniversary gift using some pictures that now are archived off my phone apparently.

It shows for me as history was cleared so I'm hoping he didn't mistakenly clear the chat history too. It's not a big deal for anyone. A chat archived just means it was moved to the ""background"" of the interface. Nothing there was deleted, just moved, and it can be moved back, just acessing the Archived Chats session - which can be accessed moving down the main screen (at least is how I do it on iOS and on Android). OK. And for the other user, it shows as history was cleared?

He did actually deleted things one so I'm really sensitive to it. If he did delete it, not archived it, it's another story. The text messages exchanged are gone from the device... but photos and files received maybe can still be accessed in the Gallery of the Phone, but that depends of the settings (Automatic Media Download automatically sent to the Gallery everything received in a chat). Ya i distinctly recall that the deleted history deleted everything. This time we'd just wrapped up talking, and I went to send a message for his return, and the chat went blank. But what isn't clear from what I'm reading online is if the indication for the non archiver is that it was cleared or archived if that makes sense? Like it would logically make sense that if he archived it, he has to unarchive it, and by doing so it would eliminate the chat history temporarily until unarchived. That's certainly what I hope. Because I was still in the app as it happenedit made it a little bit confusing. And there would be no reason to clear it, not like we were fighting lol or anything. I think he just was groggily thinking he was swiping out of the app. I know I have almost done it before myself. And there's no chance to stop, if you do it too fast. If you sent a message and the chat history was clear, with your message as the first message in the chat, he didn't archive it, he deleted it. Sorry.

Archiving a chat doesn't eliminate history. I archive chats on a daily basis. I never did lose a chat history in this process.

The button to archive a chat is right aside to the button to delete it. The only difference is... the delete button has an additional confirmation question. ""Are you sure you want to delete the chat with XXX?"", with sometimes two possible confirmations, to delete only from the device or from both devices - which I don't know if it really works, because I never deleted a chat using this option. Righto. Here's definitely did that as I initially feared. Hoped it was instead an archive that would reverse.

Once in a while I'll get a notification like ""X joined telegram"". It's usually people who I had saved in my phone like 10 years ago that I have since deleted. For example, a while back it told me that my college roommate from like 2012 joined and I know I deleted her contact information shortly after we stopped being roommates. I know it's because they have me in their contacts. Sometimes I'll get a notification and I don't even know who the person is. 

I just don't think we should be notified unless both parties have each other's numbers saved.";2020-12-03 18:15:17;"*whom* I had saved The reason is, there are hundreds of other chat applications available and if someone joins telegram and couldn't find anything interesting they will leave.

So telegram sends a message to all the contact that a person from your contact had joined and out of so many people at least someone would message a new joiner and chances of that person staying on the platform increases as someone is there to chat with them."

Se use Telegram for free just because Durov is a Goodwill billonaire, or something like that. Only 5 GB? Lol Their FAQ states that if Durov's money runs out, they'll just resort to non-essential paid features. I imagine it'd be something like paid sticker packs or some stuff that most people don't want but could be beneficial to businesses maybe. For now, seems like they still have money, although I got no idea how much running this type of service costs. I have these concerns too( I have been a faithful, hardcore user of Telegram since the early days - 219780 messages exchanged since 2015, across all the channels I use.

I would never, ever share any sensitive data on Telegram. It exists entirely on the goodwill of a few people, who actively prefer to live in the shadows, its backend is entirely closed and its encryption process is proprietary.

I am acting as if Russian intelligence services can read everything and that Durov is a plant.

If you want to exchange secrets, use GPG. Telegram is a convenience ... it's a FANTASTIC convenience, but that's it. Yes.

We rely on the goodwill and monetary supply of Durov. If he ever decides to sell up, there is a hugely lucrative amount of data, which (bar the 'secret' chats) is easily readable by Telegram and whoever buys them out. Many tech companies are at a loss an rely on investment. Im expecting the same that happened to Google Photos will happen to Telegram as well. 5gb? Those are rooky numbers! Now 1tb thats where you should be lol https://www.telegram.me/bbcpersian  has close to a million subscribers.  I'm sure there are even bigger channels.  I would not be surprised if high profile publishers somehow support telegram..  to keep the service running, as they would not otherwise be able to reach certain audience.  Don't think they are all free loading. The same thing can be said about Signal. AFAIK Telegram is relying on donations **and** Durov. I had the exact same question. Telegram's servers must be loaded so much due to all that storage, so many of those features and they let developers use their API for free without any limits. Add to that they pay their employees, sponsor programming contests etc. Durov can't have a billion dollars in cash to pay all of that and even if he had, he would have had exhausted all of it by now. So there's something else. Why are you using a messenging app as cloud storage? If something is free, you are the product the same can be said about WhatsApp as well, right?
at least before they were purchased. Yes, you can read here about some calculation How does Telegram make money? telegra.ph / How-does-Telegram-make-money-08-01 (reddit bans the link). So are we all relying on the goodwill of Durov? Of this guy: https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/28/vkontaktes-pavel-durov-explains-bizarre-money-throwing-incident/ Take into account the hundreds of millions of telegram users and total data storage goes into petabytes I am very aware of their FAQ, I researched it before posting here.

They tried to. Even tried to ban/block telegram in Russia (un banned it this year). All Russian government opposition movement using telegram. Frankly even been Russian Durov didn’t translate telegram to Russian for exactly the reason to be not associated with government (it was hard to convince people to use it there in Russia due to English language only). But privacy concerns is still there. Cloud storage - potential data breach in the nutshell. Especially groups. If you use secret chat (peer to peer with endpoint encryption and no cloud sync) you are safe as signal. I think they are brainstorming how to monetize telegram even right now. But it’s ether ads or Ton...
Using Telegram since launch in 2013. What's that GPG you're talking about? Do you have Discord ? Because you should also ask yourself the same questions, like any that you've mentioned, the spicy one being the so called ""intelligence"".
Except on discord it would be a piece of cake to retrieve any of your datas, I'm not so sure about Telegram tho ( even without secret message activated I mean ) what happened to Google photos? Telegram doesn't accept donations btw Signal does not offer cloud storage like Telegram. I don't. I use Telegram since 2013 and I have sent files around 5 GB in size (sum) overall during this time. This can be true but can be also false.
Linux is free and you are not the product.

I'm not saying anything about telegram, I'm just saying that your sentence does not keep in mind some things >If something is free, you are the product

Wikipedia is technically free, relies on donations but doesn't make it compulsory. 

A more correct term would be, if something is free and is a multi-million dollar profit making company, then you are the product. Obviously, this is also the case with WhatsApp and Facebook/Instagram Messenger. The question is: IF Telegram claims to be super secure and don't use our data, how are they planning to pay the server costs off? That's true, although the owner of Telegram is a billionaire, so he wouldn't really need the money. I do wonder how much storing all that data costs though. uh, no. Many GNU/Linux distros are the best things ever happened to this planet.

by the way, you can pay and still be the product. Which happens 100% of the time WhatsApp was $0.99/year. WhatsApp wasn’t free WhatsApp doesn't store files or messages in their servers, everything is stored on users' mobile phones. They still have to handle a lot of traffic from billons of users, but it's backed by Facebook now. the goal was to increase the user base until someone acquired them WhatsApp hasn't got cloud storage. All messages are stored on your phone. WhatsApp doesn’t store file at all. Yes Literally 7 years ago Yeah, but you can get a 10tb drive for like $150 these days. So that's 15 grand to store 1 petabyte. Sounds like a lot to a consumer, but to a large business or a billionaire like Durov, it's chump change.

EDIT: of course, that's a zero-parity approach, which is not appropriate for bulk data storage. Any realistic implementation would include some redundancies, but the point remains, it's not going to cost all *that* much. It wouldn’t be the first long-term, large and implausible rouse an intelligence service has launched. 

Look at how the British, during WWII, had to let some convoys be sunk, even though the knew (roughly) where the subs were. They had cracked Enigma, but now needed the Germans to believe they hadn’t.  A big part of Bletchley Park’s work was figuring out how many sailors had to die so others could live. 

You can be willing to suffer some losses for larger gains. 

Be that as it may, I actually believe you are right. I’ve just chosen as to act as if you’re wrong. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard I’m assuming all convenient ways of commutation is read by someone - I’ve come to accept it as the price of convenience and keep personal secrets off them all. No more unlimited space
https://imgur.com/h8YT9i5 In some months you're going to pay for photo storage over 15GB Oh, that's great to know, sorry for spreading misinformation.

I'd still trust Durov more than any big corporations like Facebook. And even if Durov would treat my data similarly to them, Telegram is still a 100x times better app They once had an official VERIFIED bot to accept donations. But it doesn't accept donations anymore. Telegram doesn't either, all they do its allow synchronizing messages across devices, Its not meant to stay there long term Oh ok, I see.  At first it sounded like you were the type to host movies on there or something. Because I feel like that is going to make running telegram more expensive Agreed. You pay for Windows but are the product. You download Linux for free and you aren't the product. Tbh I'm aware of this, but I prefer to be the product of niche Russian billionaire group than Messenger who shows me ads relevant to my ""private"" convos and connects this info with every other piece Facebook have linux is free if you don't value your time Linux as a kernel yes. But some distributions cost money It’s just a goodwill of Pavel Durov [https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/k5vsk0/how\_can\_telegram\_still\_be\_free\_i\_have\_over\_5\_gb/gehcvah?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/k5vsk0/how_can_telegram_still_be_free_i_have_over_5_gb/gehcvah?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) it was you?! might be telegram goal as well? They probably have implemented some sort of deduplication technology, so same files (or even parts of files) are only stored once even if millions of people upload them. There are way more important stuff happening in Russia than Telegram right now.  Also Durov was  forced to sell his business in Russia to the government and flee the country. He isn’t fan of political system in Russia. I know it still sounds like double spy movie but in particular Russian case I strongly believe that Russian government as much as they wanted, they can’t have the Telegram. Even if they get it, P2P messages hard to break. again political opposition and their IT security guys who are risking lives are confident about telegram for now. Me too. **[GNU Privacy Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU Privacy Guard)**

[About Me](https://www.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) - [Opt out](https://www.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) - OP can reply !delete to delete - [Article of the day](https://redd.it/k69k4u) They once had an official VERIFIED bot to accept donations. But it doesn't accept donations anymore. I've got files about 4 years old in Telegram. Obviously it's not a Google Drive replacement, but I haven't had anything deleted yet. So true 👍 Clearly you've never run Mint or Ubuntu or literally any of the more popular distros. I've run all versions of Ubuntu from 12.04 to 20.04, a bunch of variants of Mint, XDFC, LXDE, RaspbianOS and such. Never faced a problem once. For light users, there's barely a difference. Yeah Microsoft Office is a bit of a problem, but even then there are other office suites you can use, or run the online version. 

&#x200B;

So Tl;Dr Linux is not the ""geeky OS"" that only hackers can run. Times have changed. counted with your fingers. It's safe to say that all Linux distros are free of cost That is a good point. Fairly simple to implement, too, if you're only looking for true duplicates (setting aside things like the same photo in different sizes). Just keep a database column with hashes of the files. If the hashes match (maybe compare the file size too in case of a hash collision), the new file is a dupe, and doesn't need to be stored. Why would they implement redundancy for messages? Im sure they have it for user accounts, but why would they bother for things set over messages?  Its not designed to be cloud storage We ran Ubuntu and Mint but clients rejected it. Windows is still the way to go. Of course I've never run Linux, i value my time ⌚ That's exactly what they are doing, you can't upload the same vid twice, second time it will be sent instantly nerd I thought that was because it gets stored in your local cache? It is, but it is still sent instantly because tg is already aware of that file. There is something similar in bot API where each file not receives or sends gets a unique ID assigned to it. Then you can just sent a file by ID"

Plus Messenger (third party Telegram client) developer is violating the GPL license by not providing the latest source code for the app. Who do I contact?;46;k5mbms;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/k5mbms/plus_messenger_third_party_telegram_client/;8;"Plus Messenger is a popular 3rd party Android Telegram client with many cool features.

The app is a fork of the original Telegram client, which is licensed as GPLv3. This means that any modification to the client also needs to have its source code released, either publicly or upon request by anyone who has a copy of the binary.

The official Plus Messenger support group states:

""### Source Code
The last version of the source code is available to limited parties like Telegram itself. Like Telegram does sometimes, Plus Messenger dev delays the release of the source code to avoid other third party devs to use the code of Telegram and Plus Messenger in his own benefit by adding ads and other things without even giving credit to the respective authors and claiming they are the official sources.""

First of all, this is simply not true anymore. Telegram introduced reproduceable builds at the beginning of this year. Every single new release of the official clients comes with the source code via GitHub, at the same time the actual app is released.

The developer provides a [source code link](https://gitlab.com/rafalense/plus-messenger), but it is EXTREMELY outdated. The latest push that contains actual code instead of pointless README updates is from 2015 (!)

I have reached out to Telegram support via its web form to request this situation be evaluated.
The part that gets me is when the developer says ""The last version of the source code is available to limited parties like Telegram itself."" It is also mentioned as a justification in the Plus group chat. ""Don't worry, the client is safe. Telegram looks at the code and approves it so don't worry!""
This is such a bullshit argument. How could I even know if this is true? Has Telegram issued a statement regarding the code review of popular unofficial clients such as Plus? Even if they did, it still doesn't matter. **The GPL license REQUIRES that the source code be provided to anyone who gets a copy of the binary**


As I said before, I tried to contact Telegram via their support web form, however it has been almost 2 months and I received no response whatsoever.

Who do I contact regarding this issue? What can we do?";2020-12-03 03:30:25;You can do effectively nothing if telegram refuses to cooperate. Only copyright holders can enforce their copyright. You might have some luck by contacting authors of GPL libraries that telegram depends on, but that is likely futile as well. [deleted] There are many more. The only still open source more feature rich alternative I have found is Nekogram X. Everything else what seems to be more popular (Nekogram, Catogram, Plus, Telegraph) is violating GPL. It's a shame because it's the best non-official client out there. Do you know any other ways of contacting Telegram? Twitter I don't have a twitter account. Welp, gonna make one just for this then Ellos responden ahí. No se si les importe una licencia, though.

My older relatives aren't very good with installing and uninstalling apps so it was difficult to do.

I imagine I'll have them all uninstall X and install the base client, which is frustrating because X is a better experience. But it's not worth missing out on video calls.

Is X going to catch up eventually?";2020-12-02 22:37:10;"I am still using TGX as my daily driver. I don't need most of the features that were introduced in TG recently. All I really need from TGX is ""folders"" and that's it.

But yes, TGX is going to be updated soon, just stay patient :) Is X only on Android ? Nope, as it's code has now been merged into the main Telegram app (at least on iOS).  Now I use the TestFlight beta version. I loved X, but it lacks a ton of features.

X is officially dropped, iirc. I only keep it on a wack-ass device stuck on Android ICS; yeah, it's ridiculous but Telegram stock client was giving me issues on that tablet and I had to switch to X. It worked wonders and still does, I guess, it's fast and never crashes It has some hidden-default folders. Do you know them? Yes. iOS also had an X version, but it has now been merged into the main app. Yes, I do know about them - thank you :) However, unfortunately they are in very uncomfortable spot for me, very difficult to reach and ""Unread"" filter is behaving quite weirdly. Like, they are not actually unread, it's unreplied. If I go to Unread filter, open a chat that is unread and go back - it still is listed there. I either need to reply or change to different filter and go back for it to update. I'm not really liking that behavior. What ""hidden-default folders"" are you talking about? Nope.
Just opening chat would not mark it as read because telegram apps keep track of your last position in the chat.
So if you were searching or reading previous conversations and then closed chat window it will keep track of last position so whenever you open same chat window you will be see the message that you were reading last time.
And if there are few new messages, it won't mark the entire chat as read because you literally didn't read new messages.
Just scroll to the bottom (you can use the down arrow in the right bottom corner) and it will mark the entire char as read. You don't have to reply to each chat to mark it as read.

TLDR: just scroll to bottom last/recent message and the entire chat will be marked as read. in main screen of app where it shows you your chats, hold chat text on top of your chats(next to calls text) then swipe down I'm not sure if you know what I'm exactly talking about, because I know behavior you just described, but I'm talking about thing that happens only on TGX. It has filters (not folders) and behavior there is a bit different for some reason. If I open unread chat with one message and do back, that chat is still on the unread list without unread badge."

Some privacy issues and technical problems with Telegram;9;k59jm6;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/k59jm6/some_privacy_issues_and_technical_problems_with/;1;"I will explain more than one issue each separately and all of them can be easily fixed by a new update and maybe should be? Let me know what you think.

&#x200B;

1.You can hide both your phone number and your Telegram account from users whose phone numbers are not in your contacts, right? Yes, that's awesome. Simply set your ""Who can see my phone number?"" setting to ""Nobody"" and  ""Who can find me by my number?"" to ""My contacts"".

But there's a problem with that. These two settings are set to ""Everybody"" by default, when you signed up. So if you are creating a new Telegram account and don't want the users to be notified about your new account (""X joined Telegram!""), sorry, it's impossible. Even if you don't share your contacts with Telegram, the users who have your phone number will be notified. Tested.

2. If you set the ""Who can see my phone number?"" setting to ""Nobody"", why is the ""Who can find me by number?"" setting has no option as ""Nobody""? It only has ""Everybody"" and ""My contacts"" options... Anyway, if you set the  ""Who can find me by my number?"" to ""My contacts"" (since there's no ""Nobody"" choice for this setting), will your contacts be able to see your phone number?

* If yes (which is expected), what's the meaning of having the ""Nobody"" option for the ""Who can see my phone number?"" setting? (FYI, you can set it to ""Everybody"", ""My contacts(?)"" or ""Nobody"")
* If no, how can they find you by your number without seeing your number? These two settings are in conflict imo and need to be explained clearly or I'm missing something.

&#x200B;

3. If you take backup with the export tool of the desktop app, you'll see a notice about that this export tool is in the beta stage and will be updated very soon (I think there was something like a warning saying it will be updated in a month or so with additional features, but I'm not sure. But I'm sure about that this notice has been there for months or years)

4. If you left a channel or group you created and cleared the suggestions so you can't see them in the search, you can't find them anywhere anymore and can't join back ( even if you know their IDs ). If you use the export tool, you'll see all of them if you have at least one message in these channels/groups or if they're private. But still you can't join back unless you have their invite link.

So you don't have control over your own channels/groups and your data inside them if you've left them. If you need to delete a message from them, you can only delete your account. Crazy. It will not remove them though, just will break the relation to your account by setting their sender to ""Deleted Account"". These channels and groups will continue to live.

...I'm on mobile and it takes time to write all so I will stop here.

\_\_\_\_\_

I love Telegram anyway but there are some problems and I can't find someone to tell about them. Most of my messages to the Support are unanswered and left as they are (some of them were still unread). I tried different communication channels but they dont like to write back I guess. There should be a transparent system to create bug tickets and discuss about. There are much more problems I am aware of but don't want to waste my time because I know that I will not get any response back. However, I tried my chance with Reddit one more and last time. Let's see what will happen. I am using Telegram since the beginning, 2013 or 2014, don't remember exactly. I understand that it has much much more users now and it's hard to listen to all of them but some important things shouldnt disappear before they are heard";2020-12-02 16:50:06;"> they dont like to write back I guess

This is pretty common with companies unless you have some legitimate gripe that causes bad PR. The issues you listed seem fixable, not sure if easily or not since I'm no techie, but I feel like if they notice them - they'll address them. Might not happen right away but with monthly updates, it should come. The only problem is getting stuff noticed. If you messaged them on Twitter - seemingly their most active platform - then it was noticed, like 75% chance or something. But as far as I remember their support is all volunteers so that's bound to be less reliable."

Does anyone use telegram for nsfw? How to be safe?;0;k530kv;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/k530kv/does_anyone_use_telegram_for_nsfw_how_to_be_safe/;9;"Hi so I tried using telegram for nsfw as I could find videos on there from ph and such and save it in my own personal channel. But I found something shocking and deleted telegram to try to keep myself safe. 
Anyone got any info on how to avoid these things?
Or anyone had experienced this and are still keeping there account? 
Just these type of questions as honestly I get paranoid very easy and would like others opinions.
Thanks";2020-12-02 08:20:05;"[deleted] it happens, even if you don’t use it for porn. 

just copy the link to the message, chat it’s hosted in, and user’s profile (a screenshot and a user ID should be enough) and report it to stopca@telegram.org. What do you mean by “ph”? Ped stuff. reported it as soon as I seen it and deleted all info on my phone related to telegram then deleted telegram to be safe. I didn't know there was a site to report them is it better than doing it from telegram itself? Sorry for late reply. ph means po*n hub [deleted] it’s an email address, and it’s better than the abuse one because this one is specifically for child abuse stuff. stuff i’ve reported usually goes down in a few days What I used to do was make a private channel then forward porn videos and clips to it.

And I did delete my account as I noticed even if I do nothing having it pop on your screen while scrolling down porn channels it would save a catche of the image on your phone. I found this out by checking my phone's storage out of worry. And I do not want police accusing me of stuff (bad experience when they kicked in my door saying I deal drugs..I don't and they refused to fix my door or anything. Didn't even let me see the 'warrent' they had) Ah that's good then I reported a channel and it took about 3 months for it to get taken down. So that is a better place to report then. [deleted] True I could do that I just don't think when I panic. Worse is when I know police where I am will make things bigger than they sound or just out right lie because they think there the law. (In total through my life I had easy 10 experiences with police in a bad light. 15 getting pinned for going to main office in school. 17 one trying to have a square go at me for pointing out he is wrong. 20 the drug thing are only some)
So if your 100% sure that if I delete it cache and all I will go back onto telegram."

So the limit is neither two of the original gigabytes, nor two of the SI gigabytes. What is it then?";2020-12-01 17:46:24;"I figured it out with tests: It's 2000MB, so 2097152000 Bytes. I have no idea why that value specifically and the official statement of ""2GB"" is wrong then, but I guess using a number below 2GB is done to fully support 32bit systems (because 2GB-1Byte is the maximum in some cases there). Telegram file size limit:

= 2000\*1024\*1024 Bytes= 2,097,152,000 Bytes= 2,048,000 KiB= 2,000 MiB= 1.95 GiB Why on Earth you would need to figure out that? To upload files, of course. I need to know where to split it. I don't want to split it too early and make needlessly many files, but I also don't want to split it too late and have to throw it all away because I can't upload it.

For example I could now upload 1TB of data in 525 files (53 messages). If it was actually 2GB, I would only need 512 files (52 messages), if it was 2\*1000³ bytes, I would need 550 files (55 messages). In the past, the limit was 1.5\*1000³ bytes, so I would have needed 734 files (734 messages). (To be fair, I never uploaded 1TB at once, but 133GB did happen.) Ok, makes sense."

MS Store rates Telegram PEGI 18 for Extreme Violence. Bur Whatsapp gets PEGI 3 of course...;202;k4kd5h;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/j9au0ymrpk261.jpg;45;[deleted];2020-12-01 15:59:16;"I have been on Telegram for a long time and have convinced my entire circle of friends to adopt it too.

I love Telegram.

But if I may play Devil's advocate for a second: It is clearly easier to find extreme content on Telegram than Whatsapp, is it not?

Telegram is BY FAR the best app for chatting with friends, but it also holds many community features which Whatsapp does not ... unless there's something I'm missing.

It's easier to join a ""community of strangers"" on Telegram than on Whatsapp - at least that's my impression.

Given Telegram's harder line on free speech - which I applaud - and their refusal to work with police in many cases where Whatsapp would oblige, Telegram tends to attract a different audience.

As a parent, I'd like the app ratings to reflect the experience my kids are likely to have on the app - and given that my daughter is on both Whatsapp and Telegram, I've been able to observe first hand what she is being exposed to, without really trying. And facts of the matter are that the stuff she sees on Telegram is far more likely to involve strangers and far more likely to involve illegality. 

Of course my observations are personal and may differ at large. 

Indeed 18 seems a bit extreme - it's kinda like saying the open internet should be rated 18, when of course we teach our children to navigate it with care.

But from my personal experience, clearly the experience with Whatsapp and Telegram differs and I'm not surprised Telegram is rated higher than Whatspp. LOL, chatting with friends is violent. I'm happy with that. Sorry kiddos, you aren't welcome, and I don't want to think about you when shitposting in public chats Microsoft doesn't rate.
Fyi: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/age-ratings ...Messaging apps get ratings? That's dumb as hell, your experience on the app depends on who you talk to, how can you rate that? If some kid installs it just to talk to their parents (pick me up from school, buy some milk on your way home, etc) then it shouldn't be PEGI 18. That's like saying Photoshop is PEGI 18 because you can draw a dick in it. Reminds me of video game trailers... Sorry, what is the Microsoft Store again? Oh right, I remember now, it's where I downloaded Minesweeper and got sex ads in-game. Well, yes. There's some dark stuff on this app if you dive deep enough. Yeah, you either accept that little rating or you get forced out of groups once they are flagged nsfw without a way to revert it or get back into the group. Words hurts Actually if your go deep down in telegram you can see alot violence video i dont think i will say example but yes it can be that cause unlike whatsapp telegram can delete account and make a new one without new number it just telegram is like dark web but version app in there maybe you can find you personal credentials somewhere in telegram it's almost 2021, yet people still are attracted by MS store like a magnet to steel wait, in my country messaging apps are ""requires parent supervision"", both telegram and WA Actually, EU had to rate it Well you know, it's much harder to find a beheading video on WhatsApp than on Telegram. 

I can actually find also a christchurch shooting video on Telegram. None on WhatsApp. what did you expect ? in Whatsapp you have to know people who knows people who know the inappropriate groups there, on Telegram all you have to do is find group via global Telegram search or through Google.  


i myself use Teleteens app to use Telegram without all the NSFW content. definitely prefer that than Telegram vanilla.. I guess it's because of public groups, channels and the ""find nearby"" function. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_WhatsApp_lynchings

Sure, Whatsapp is much safer...
Though I can't deny, they did setup some security mechanisms since then I agree with this. Telegram's stronger community features make it very easy to find disturbing content. Children should not really be on the platform imo. Exactly, Whatsapp doesn't have public groups or channels. Yeah I can't tell how many times I've written @something and clicked on whatever i wrote instead of something (usually whatever funky word someone's written in our group chat) and it led to an nsfw channel or group chat. Rating is appropriate. Exactly this.

Once I was searching a friend of mine (instead of scrolling through the list) and by making a typo a got a list of questionable public groups instead...

I think some sort of optional parental control wouldn't harm the app. It’s easy to find public groups on telegram yes. 

I just wondering how is Reddit/Twitter/discord rated on the windows store? [deleted] Only on Russian apps! xD So it was you all this time!!!! ;) Voting to get photoshop and my web browser XXX-rated! I hated it when I had an iphone and I couldn't access several of my channels from my phone I have access to all that and more with my web browser. Where is that???

I would argue Reddit is better policed than telegram. Twitter you may have a point on. That's an edge case. Telegram is not Russian in fact its so anti Russian its genius creator was kicked out of Russia after he was robbed of his multi billion dollar corporation. By Putin's friend.  In further retaliation the Russian government attempted to imprison him for life and ban Telegram in all Russia.

The Indian WhatsApp lynchings are a spate of mob-related violence and killings following the spread of rumours, primarily relating to child-abduction and organ harvesting, via the WhatsApp message service. The spate of lynchings commenced in May 2017 with the killing of seven men in Jharkhand, but did not become a national trend until the beginning of the following year. Fake messages customised with locally specific details are circulated along with real videos attached to fake messages or claims. In almost all of the lynching locations, no child abductions had been recorded in the previous three months.The majority of the attacks have occurred in villages deep within interior regions.

One that's way worse than 4chan. A site that doesn't even remove exif data from pictures, making them easily traceable. Yeah, but the creator is Russian (there's nothing bad about that, he just is).

On the 25th of March by the way, i got my phone number banned from Telegram, for setting Telegram as name. I was joking around in a group when i decided to do that. I didn't know there were bannable names. I was just stupid. After a month trying to reach the support (emailing every address i could find and tweeting to the Twitter Telegram support) i finally got answered. They asked me more details regarding the ""joke"" (i said that setting that name was a joke for my friends, and it actually was) . I proceeded to answer explaining precisely what happened. I remembered them that i have no malicious intentions, and that i need the platform for communicating with my parents (i have no mobile data connection at home and i don't have WhatsApp). Btw, i didn't receive further answers. For the next months, i kept on sending emails and regularly trying to login with my number, but i had already lost hope. Some days ago, on the 25th of November (exactly 6 months after the ban), i logged in successfully! The actual account had been deleted, but i could finally recreate another account with my number and get to use Telegram again. 
So. apparently the punishment for setting Telegram as name is 6 months of ban. Or it was just for me, idk. 
A funny thing is that as soon as i created the account, i got a permanent limitation, Spam Bot said. I achieved to remove the limitation through the Spam Bot, sending a report.  Cool story!";2020-11-30 16:48:27;"I wonder if you had you telegram set to delete itself after 6 months of not being used and that’s what happened. > I didn't know there were bannable names 

I still don't know. What are the other names that cannot be used? Are there any specific rules about it, or anything that's not an exactly standard given name could be at risk? What the fuck do they get off banning people for something they could easily prevent by coding it into the app? Seems like a power trip. FYI: Telegram can also ban your account if you change your name to ""Saved Messages"" with the relevant profile picture. I don't know why telegram let users choose those names at first place! It's so dumb when you can prohibit those names easliy not doing it, and instead ban the users who do that! Why not just banned taking name as Telegram, t3legram etc etc from server side rather than banning users like this ! For me when I got limited ([@SpamBot](http://t.me/spambot) said permanent, several times lol) for forwarding spam to a group dedicated to report such content I emailed `recover@telegram.org` which usually got my account unlimited again within 24-72 hours. [deleted] oh my. I didn't even know that this kind of ban was possible. 

Thanks for the info, though. I'm sorry for what happened You could just have deleted your account and made its again. So was it good? Was it bad? TL;DR?? Better to set it to 3 months auto s destruct no, i was actually using telegram until the ban lmao. The reason for the ban is clear: i told a friend of mine who didn't have Telegram to try and set Telegram as name, same thing happened. Telegram and Saved Messages are restricted names because people impersonate Telegram and social engineer accounts or usernames out of other users The Telegram name. i set it to Telegram [deleted] no, it doesn't work like that. The moment you get banned, you disconnect and once you try to log back, it says the phone number is blocked. There is no way you can enter/control your account it seems likely that after 6 months the account auto deleted itself and OP was able to create a new one with the same number
 
No one at Telegram helped them
 
But to be honest I had a hard time following what they said, and they replied to a few people here with irrelevant replies, so there is a distinct possibility that the people at TG Support who they talked to misunderstood too and didn't help them out because of it
 
That said, being instabanned for setting your name to Telegram just shouldn't be a thing. There should be filters to prevent people from setting it to names like that
 
Apparently Saved Messages is bannable and it follows that Stickers would also likely be bannable What you said and what he said don't intersect. You did use Telegram until you got banned (from using your account). If your account has a default self-deletion 6-month period, then, as you are inactive due to being banned, the account self-deletes and allows for new usage of the phone number. Source?

Are there any other restricted names? Probably also Stickers then [deleted] Yeah I get that but it's not too hard to code the app to prevent users from making account names such as that. Lazy developers. YoMommaJokeBot's mama is so fat that ISS astronaut can see her from space  


^I ^am ^a ^bot ^that ^fucks ^YoMommaJokeBot's ^mum. ^Downvote ^will ^not ^remove. ^Upvote ^to ^fuck ^this ^bot. Ok Got it. It's different. Just wanted to say that I couldn't be clearer when emailing the support,what is so difficult when i say that i got instabanned for setting""Telegram"" as name? Mucho texto Why don't they just disallow anyone setting their name as Telegram instead of making it an instant ban? aha, well yes that's right, sry. Btw i don't really care about the messages themselves. The most important to me is actually being able to use the platform. Those are all restricted names. Source is situations that happened with other users and results of my own testing on few of my virtual phone number accounts Maybe, because you used Telegram with other word it’s not laziness, it’s to ensure that people can’t just bruteforce how to go undetected by Telegram, while making their name Telegram or Saved Messages ok. You asked and I have no filter today 
  
That was the one part of your story that I was able to decipher. I had to read it twice and I have been doing IT Support for 12 years now. I am used to users being confusing. But even your replies to people are confusing. You aren't concise and details are often placed out of order and you have a tendency to be vague. Your grammar and formatting are both subpar I agree, it would be easier than going though this. Idk lmao. Maybe they wanna catch the scammers instead of just giving them a how-to-bypass-our-rules guide. I have 4 SIM cards, and I also use TextNow to get 2 numbers, and Google Voice to get another one. So I have quite a few accounts. No risk of getting locked out of the service. I don’t think you understand. They could just add like 2 lines of code that rejects the changing of a users name to Telegram or Saved Messages or whatever. Sir, i don't know what to say apart from: it's not my native language. also, the crux of the matter is what you deciphered at first, and i didn't really say much else. Please forgive me Hi Don'tBuyMeGold I've been trying really hard to use TextNow. I need someone to help me set my account to be able to use it. Can I come over to your DM? i don’t think you understand. scammers are smarter than you think, they’re not going to use the names Telegram or Saved Messages directly from their keyboard. look up what blank or ZWJ characters are. First off, it's Ms, not sir
 
Second, it doesn't matter whether or not it's your first language, if the way you write is confusing, it's confusing. That's just the way it is
 
I could easily see the support interpreting you explaining that you were ""joking"" since quotes can imply sarcasm, that you were trying to prank your ""friends"" in a nefarious way and therefore dismissed your case Mind telling me where to find TextNow please. Thanks Didn't know that, interesting. But I'm just referring to OP's situation, I assume he changed the name to Telegram with regular characters from his keyboard, and got banned. It shouldn't require a call to support to unban someone for doing that, just prevent it in the app. Of course, if someone is using advanced techniques to spoof an official telegram channel, they should be banned. You're right that these limitations won't stop intelligent scammers. That doesn't mean they shouldn't do it. They could save people from accidentally breaking the rules and maybe even stop some dumb scammers too. Playstore that’s exactly why it got banned. but this brings me back to my original point - add in that restriction and the spammers will figure out how to dodge the system in hours. with the current method, it requires having to own a stockpile of phone numbers, VPNs, and time to figure it out because each time you mess up, an account is gone. 

that being said, it’s easy to get it unbanned. simply email the prefilled email address the prefilled form given to you choose help > select an email client. takes a couple weeks to be unbanned. of course, that only happens if the correct email address is chosen... But benz240 is right. To prevent users from typing in these bannable names does not prevent Telegram from banning people who somehow succeed to overcome this restriction.... this would save those people who do not know that these are bannable names and are just joking around time and would also save Telegram support time as they would not get those request to unban those accounts. And people who do this on purpose to spam and scam would still be banned."

iOS app only sends videos when app is not backgrounded;15;k3ab2o;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/k3ab2o/ios_app_only_sends_videos_when_app_is_not/;12;"Basically I wanted to see if anyone else experiences this behavior: when I send a video on Telegram iOS, I have to keep the app open/foregrounded in order for the video to be sent. If I background the app at any point while the video is about to be sent (or is being sent), when I come back later, the video transfer is aborted.

This doesn't happen with the Telegram Android app. It happens on iOS only, and on 2 iPhones (different OS versions) at least. I've also been updating Telegram regularly but that behavior persists. 

Does that sound like a bug or a known limitation to anyone? I asked Telegram about it but they haven't responded. Thanks!";2020-11-29 17:32:58;"Might be a limitation of ios, which heavily restrictres what App can do in background. Limitation since iOS13. 

Apps are not allowed to perform tasks in the background for more than 30s, except a few exceptions (music app, location update, etc.).

Source: I am a developer and ran into this issue for one of our app last month. Same here. Probably a limitation of iOS but I have a suspicion that the developer could do more but chooses not to. Telegram heavily favors Android and seems to have a personal vendetta against Apple. iOS gives apps 30 seconds to run in the background before they are suspended. so make sure the option is in settings > data Lmao, Apple is shit I have the same problem since 1 year. It’s happen only with Telegram. Do you know if there’s anything I, as a user, can tweak in my phone’s settings to change that? Loving everything about iOS14 except this. especially given how often pavel durov likes to complain about apple in his personal telegram channel. Some android apps behave exactly the same. It's not a platform problem. I don't think Telegram is deliberatily making the iOS experience worse because of its beef with Apple, especially considering that the android app has a similar issue with video uploading being unreliable/buggy I'm not sure, but maybe tweaking the battery settings, but I can't tell, we switched the way our feature works to get it done.

But unfortunately it seems to be a locked iOS rule since iOS13 to increase battery life. Even if I thought file uploads could be done in the background, the limit is 30s, so everytime I see someone struggling with something stopping in the background after 30s I think about this. Well it's not just this issue. Telegram has known about HDR video for some time now and sure enough, no support for it at the time of iPhone 12/iOS 14 release. I'm sure it will work in about a year or two. Ugh"
[Q] how to reserve a nickname;2;k39ftm;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/k39ftm/q_how_to_reserve_a_nickname/;8;[removed];2020-11-29 16:33:31;"Maybe the solution would be creating a public channel with the name, so the @ is ""protected"" Mine is quite wanted too, apparentky there's several Russian twitch streamers that have asked for it and will also get random messages in Russian,  really wish Telegram would make an acceptance system so randoms couldn't message or add you to group texts. I have an @ from black panther for a few years now, because of the comic, but since the movie came out I receive a lot of messages from Africa each month. I just got used to it. You can create a public channel with your account. Change your username, then set the channel link to your old username that you want to reserve. Later you can just change the channel link and reuse it as your username.

As long as you do all of this with the same account, there shouldn't be any issues with cooldowns (the name becomes available as soon as you change away from it). Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla venenatis eget leo non elementum. Morbi tincidunt non arcu vitae porta. Donec. I didn't think channels had nicknames; this is solved for me.
And I also have a channel with a single message to troll the people who were annoying me.
many thanks i definitely agree because i'm not even using a popular name, it's only a word which happens to be common in black humour/meme communities. Funny but annoying >really wish Telegram would make an acceptance system so randoms couldn't message or add you to group texts.

While it won't prevent random people from messaging you, you can prevent them from adding you to groups by only allowing your contacts to do so :: settings > privacy and security > groups > my contacts"

No way. No, that is not possible. It's not possible, mostly because it would be easy to abuse. Like if you told someone something private and then bam, they add someone into your chat and now they can see your secrets. Maybe if it required approval from both sides to add someone but even that's a bit sus. I don’t think it is possible or at least as easy as that. 
You could create a group and forward all conversation from your private chat to that new group. 
But yes, Telegram does not include timestamp metadata such as WhatsApp. 

For that purpose, you could:
1. Export all chat data from Telegram Desktop. 
2. Create a Telegram Bot (it is not that difficult if you have some programming knowledge). Maybe there is some bot creared to do that purpose. Or I could create one if there isnt. 
3. Create a group, adding needed members and the bot. 
4. Start the bot and make it forward all messages with a proper formatting, such as 
Name of sender
Time of sender
Content of message

I think this is an overkill but it is the only way I found to achieve your goal :( u can do that by using external apps on android.. there are apps which read notifications and can redirect based on ur preference.. example: autoresponder for tg on play store (note: i donot have affiliation with this app) .."

Also you can export your chats but there is no way to restore them.  
And in the end, your personal chat on your side will be gone. But they will remain there for the other side. If the chats are on your phone but not on your desktop, then they were probably ""private"" chats, which means they are encrypted with a key that is only present on your phone.  

Unfortunately, by design, these aren't going to be retrievable from anywhere else.  

As far as your account itself, if you are logged in to the desktop client, you should be able to use that as your second factor.  When you try to log in on the new phone, you should be getting a message on the desktop with the code to use for the second factor.

The second factor is not a fixed password.  It is a 6-digit code that is unique every time you attempt to log in. I see, so my chats with other people will still remain on their side, just not on my side. What will happen if I were to join back telegram, since I am using the same number, and since there is data on the ""previous account"" in my friend's messages, will it restore itself? It sounds like you didn't turn on 2-step verification for your Telegram account. 

It is a fixed password, not a 6-digit code. Yes but they require me to key in a password for it after this code. I am able to go through the SMS process/ verification. Its afterwards this 2FA password that I cannot bypass When you delete you account, your chat on the other side will be renamed to Deleted account.  
So when you return back, telegram will make a new empty chat with your name and number and the older messages will be another chat named Deleted account. Oh, when OP said 2FA I thought he meant Two Factor Authentication.  I didn't realize there was another thing.

I enter my fixed password on a new device then get a 6 digit code from an existing device as a second factor. I guess you can't disable the 2fa via your desktop? I believe the correct order to log in your account on a new device is:
1. use your telephone number to get a 5-digit logon code sent by the official Telegram user (either on another logged in device, or via SMS), input the logon code, if the logon code is correct, you are basically verified by the first step, if you didn't turn on ""2-step verification"", you are fully logged in on the new device;
2. if you have turned on ""2-step verification"" for your account, now you'll need to input your password to fully log in on the new device. The 6 digit code is considered the first factor. i need the 2fa to disable it Ah, okay, thank you.  I guess it's been a while. Damn. I hope you remember it!"

You should look at upgrading to Windows 10, Linux Mint, Manjaro, or another currently supported OS. It's a pretty bad security risk to use Windows 7 now that it's out of support.

Sorry for my bad English, "" normal contact I meant those used on Google account"". If he saved your contact from WhatsApp, then certainly the same contact info is synced between all the apps allowed to access contacts (Permissions). The person then can certainly see if you are also on Telegram or any other service relying on that phone number eg., Duo, Signal etc. Go to settings and set ""who can se my phone number"" to no one or ""my contacts"", and who can find me as well."
Muted chat notifications badge counter not shown on dock icon;9;k2kjjs;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/k2kjjs/muted_chat_notifications_badge_counter_not_shown/;3;"Hello everyone,

I have two Macs, a desktop and a laptop. The desktop and laptop using the latest macOS version (7.2.1 (207127)) from telegram.org. **Not the appstore version!**

I have a group which is muted, but I enabled badge counter for ""count unread messages"". See the [picture](https://imgur.com/PS9xaFa). 

The strange thing is I do not get badge counts for the messages in the dock **on laptop** but I get the numbers on desktop. When I'm on laptop, I get the badge count numbers **only** when I'm mentioned. The same thing applies when I unmute the group chat, I still not receiving unread numbers on app icon only when I'm mentioned.

I tried reinstalling the app from telegram.org and from appstore. When I removed the app, I used [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) and [CleanMyMac's uninstaller](https://macpaw.com/cleanmymac). I tried reseting notifications. Nothing helped.

It's annoying. (If it matters, I use a *Mi 3s prime android* mobile.) I use the latest app.

Also, the [web.telegram.org](https://web.telegram.org) doesn't work always. It keeps saying '**connecting...**'.";2020-11-26 16:43:46;"I  have the same problem and my very uninformed guess is that telegram is waiting for a full TCP handshake while one or other app is figuring things out with UDP packets. I experience exactly the opposite. Telegram works splendidly in even the worst network conditions, whilst whatsapp wouldn't even send messages. Are you sure your cell phone provider is not prioritising whatsapp traffic? Used to be the opposite. Maybe it depends on which client you're using. I personally use Plus. this always happens to me when in the mountains with half a bar of 3G. texting might work but telegram keeps hitting TCP timeouts. Connecting issue has been there since forever. It is indeed annoying. Could you please help me with the ** a full TCP... UDP packets**? I don't understand. I am not a CS/IT person. Interesting.

How would I know if the network provider is doing something odd? I don't think simply asking them would work. Is there a reliable test I can do? 1. Opposite, as in Telegram working well and not WhatsApp 

2. What do you mean by *which client* ?

3. What's a Plus? Is there a Telegram plus or something? I use 4G LTE, live in a typical village area, and the connection strength I am talking about is usually 1-2 bars out of 5 bars(maximum strength). I'm gonna oversimplify a lot here. 

TCP sends stuff and waits for you to reply with a ""got it!"" before going on.

UDP yeets stuff at you without a care in the word. So TCP provides a reliable connection that makes sure everything has arrived, but the first few communications between the app and the server are just to make sure the network is reliable (which in this case isn't) and no actual data is sent in this initial process (called handshake, also known as ""connecting..."").

With UDP you can send data on the first communication trial which would be helpful on a slow network, but it doesn't guarantee the application that there is a reliable connection, so there is extra work for app developers to figure that out. That is the difference between HTTP/1 and 2 vs HTTP/3, which tries to optimize on that handshake.

Anyway, this is an uninformed guess and this may or may not explain the being stuck on connecting situation. To keep it simple
https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/9gcwgw/tcp_vs_udp/

and
https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/hzgh80/i_think_tcp_is_safer/ I'm not sure you can easily test that, it probably require some form of packet analysis. But you could try looking them up to see if somebody else has done that already. Opposite as in Telegram used to work for me when no other app would.

And I mean, there's Telegram X, there's Plus Messenger, there's TelegramFOSS and a few others. The lightest ones are perhaps X and FOSS but I'm not really sure as I haven't tested them with poor connection. You can try and get to your own conclusions on which one works best for you. This is possibly the best explanation I have ever seen of TCP vs UDP. Well done."

I don't know that it would be any different because I don't think it's about WhatsApp or Telegram but more about how the applications themselves work with the smartphone, however, I could be wrong. Could you possibly try to find out if when the person accepts (like on Whatsapp) they won't even be shown as online (for having accepted the call)? That is, on whatsapp, let's say I call you and you answer. You won't have shown as ""online"" to a third party when you received that call unless you actually opened up the app at the same time somehow or were already on it when they called. For example, to test it, all one would have to do is have a buddy give them a call and have the app opened but minimized in the background of their phone. When the call comes in, it should simply show as ""incoming call"" from Telegram. In accepting it, I don't know that the online status will change either. What is your opinion, provided you have the time to read all this but maybe not to test it?

It is disappointing that telegram hasn't fixed this. implementing those features should have been paramount from the beginning instead of animated stickers, animated emojis, whatever. It's a matter of priorities It’s gotten better over the years but yeah VO support is still laughable. 

Even discord is doing more. Telegram has opened a Bugs and Suggestions page, and they list this issue there, so we can go there and vote it up.

[https://bugs.telegram.org/c/292](https://bugs.telegram.org/c/292) I'm not saying this in Telegrams name. 
I mean it's okay of you to ask, but it's not okay of you to demand. I can't even imagine how much of a limitation blindness is, but I suppose you people are used to limitations by now? You don't have to use Telegram if it doesn't support those things, Telegram is non profit and barking at them can't accomplishment anything.

For example, a lot of services and online shops don't support my country, and the prices are among the most expensive ones anywhere... Is that unfair, yeah, should I be mad, yeah... Do I suck it up because I know I can't do anything about it but move out? Yeah... So maybe you should move out as well... Telegram can only have so many features, and they get so many features with each update you can't find something like that in any other messaging app... And maybe one day they'll add what you need... But until then, barking doesn't do anything, and blaming them is just rude and you're being self privileged. Thanks for this. There are a few organizations that do similar things, and contacting them couldn't hurt. Saving this. There is no Telegram X on iOS anymore. Telegram is the Telegram X. Telegram X was actually completely unusable when it first hit the store. It wasn't until a couple of months after the merger that the first pieces of VoiceOver accessibility were added. That's definitely what I would prefer. I want people to have their fun features, but it's honestly not that difficult to develop things that are accessible from the start. Every accessibility bug is an oversight. ""you people,"" lmao Accessibility is not a privilege, it's a right. If some fundamental feature of Telegram were broken for months, or if they had a mostly permanent track record of breaking features more than they fixed them, don't you think non-marginalized communities would complain about it too? I've been nice, over and over. I spent hours working with support and filing the major bugs with them. This is me running out of nice because nice is not working.

Also, it's very likely that there *is* a law that requires Telegram be accessible. I don't bring this up because that really would be demanding. The point is not to throw the law at them; it's to speak as someone who regularly has to wonder if pressing the update button will permanently lock me out of part of an app I use every day, and if I'll have to convince everyone in my contacts to talk to me somewhere else. Have you ever tried that, by the way? Telling a bunch of people and groups that you'd really appreciate it if they'd move to another app? It doesn't usually work out well. Ditching Telegram isn't as simple as deleting my account and boycotting it for the rest of eternity. And it's worse because when they were actually fixing things, I advocated for it. I wanted to see it get better and I believed it could. Over the last year, nothing has changed despite the growing number of blind users.

So no, I won't apologize for anything I said. Accessibility is not a feature or a privilege. I'm not being rude to any single person; in fact I'd do the opposite if I could get *literally ANYONE* from Telegram to acknowledge our existence. That's basically 90% of the problem. I feel sad that this comment is being criticized like this. It is common sense. They have a company that offers a service that is free. As long as they respect the law, nothing is mandatory, they can develop any feature they want or not in whichever timeframe they want. If any user is unhappy just choose another app that has the features you want. That app doesn't exist? Maybe there's a reason for that besides people being __evil__. Try to do it yourself and see how it goes. Ah right, still a thing on android You don't gain rights by being rude to the people who provide service for free. You can ask and be patient. If there are other like minded people like you they will vote you up and that might get the developers attention... But until then, yes, you're not a priority. Just because you're disabled does it means everyone has to adapt to you? Does disability end up being reward for you? Why are you trying to compensate for something you know never will be compensated, but in the meantime you also are being rude to people that are not disabled and making them adapt to you.

I'm not saying they shouldn't release a solution, but this is really not the way. They will not flinch when you're trying to shame them on their sub... That's just not the way it works. Stop acting self privileged to people, especially to the ones that have no use of you. They're not even trying to make use of you, maybe one day they will, but even then you'd still be rude

I'm sure developers will do something about it in the meantime, but 4 months might not seem a lot as it might seem to you... So give them some time tbh this is the wrong place to ask for support. maybe it would be better if you asked people to retweet/like/comment on a reply to Telegram, but the devs don’t look at this sub often, if at all. you’re basically preaching to the choir here. 

but yes, it’s still frustrating how TG just doesn’t care about accessibility. i don’t even blame the devs, i blame management for not prioritizing it. it’s gotten so bad that on Android, there was a client made specifically for blind people. and on the beta chat, there’s a dedicated team of users who report accessibility issues to the Android dev but i’m not sure if the dev reads their messages (i think he does though). and then there’s Unigram, who’s dev will basically fix any minor accessibility problem after you report it. It's great that Telegram is free but Pavel is worth 3 1/2 billion dollars. Not everyone can just go out and ""do it themselves."" Also, how is asking for better standards for disabled users the same as calling them evil? i read a while along that they wouldn't develop telegram x anymore on android. and they only will give minimum updates I'm getting mixed feelings about this comment.

Yes, patience is in general something you should try to achieve in life, and being impatient won't be good, in general. Maybe 4 months is just too little for them right now, I agree with you. And I agree, that, in general, demanding things is not something you should do, especially with people that give you services for free.

On the other hand, there is nothing to ""adapt to"". No one will be given any disadvantage if an accessibility issue (which IMO is an important issue), and blind people do have their right to get their messaging app (""being used to disability"" is not an excuse). And also, because of multiple first hand stories, I really understand the anger at a company which does things you really love and suddenly they disappoint you by doing an objectively wrong things and they will be totally deaf to your point. Telegram is in general not very open to their members' opinion, that's something we have to admit. How about [two years?](https://reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/9kl6ee/blind_people_are_almost_entirely_shut_out_of/)

Accessibility is not a feature. > You can ask and be patient

This is the most ridiculous attitude ever. How do you think (social) progress happens? When people take a stand and demand it.

You think women got the right to vote by asking for it and being patient? Do you think slavery was outlawed because slaves politely asked politicians and patiently waited for things to get better?

Do you think companies make their websites accessible for disabled users because someone asked them to and waited? No, it's because there was [pressure on the government to enact the law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_Act_2010) and now [companies can, and do, get sued if they don't comply](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/guides/disabled-access-to-websites-under-uk-law). Fuck off with your tone policing. Rights are never granted, they're *demanded* by people who've had enough. Being polite and asking politely is a great way to continue being ignored. There is actually a client made for blind people on iOS, as well. But it's honestly terrible. It looks and feels like an app made by someone who has no clue how an iOS app should look, it's buggy, and basic features are pay-to-use. I'd rather just switch to Discord. I totally agree with you. If they have the funding for it, I guess it should be done as well. I just find it sad that people don't ask for it, they __demand__ it, and don't try to understand the work it takes to make the things that they think are rights possible. I really hope telegram will address this soon, and we should ask for it as a community, but also understand that it won't magically be made. >  read a while along that they wouldn't develop telegram x anymore on android

where did you see this? i still use telegram x on android. This comment is ridiculous

Demand it of Facebook or Google.. not a company providing a service for free and not making money from it

If there's a law that forces them to do it then they should comply unfortunately but it's still ridiculous

Otherwise let them get to it when they have time

Nobody is forced to use telegram. Where there is a demand there is a product.. When there is a minority that demands a product customers usually get charged for it. I bet all of the tools blind people use are expensive as hell

Are you really comparing slavery with this? I suppose Telegram developers are whipping their blind users and making them guess what the screen says for fun. Woman and slaves worked in and worked for the country they lived in, they worked and didn't receive the appropriate compensations and rights they deserved, they were only threatened by their own country and people and could not be self dependent... And now you're making problem that one out of dozens of messaging service suddenly doesn't do what you want while the fix might be coming. 

Developed countries, once their standards are high enough can make any kind of other standards. That is something eastern countries can't afford, but you guys can because you don't have anything of bigger importance to deal with, and your country is formed well. I'm not saying helping people with disabilities is not important, but that is not eastern countries have time to deal with. They don't have a budget for such stuff either because it's already in someones corrupted pocket already, or because they just don't have it. You're dealing with Russians here, people you can only be grateful to because they managed to actually give such a platform for free... Will it always be free? Probably not.. But until then, you can't fight against someone that gives you service for free and doesn't ask anything from you. They will not flinch because someone who were *demanding* stuff suddenly left.

If you're using stuff for free, you can't demand anything. You don't own them, you don't pay them, you do nothing. You can ASK for a fix, you can HELP them make a fix (if they are accepting any help), but you CAN'T demand anything. If you don't treat developers with respect, you won't be treated with respect for sure. This way you're just ensuring that they won't give a single fuck.

Show them your unsatisfaction and find another messaging solution which satisfies your specific needs, just like every other human being does when they don't find a certain messenger satisfactory. If they fix it you'll come back and that will be great, don't sit on top of their heads until they fix it

Once you create a global service with only couple of developers, FOR FREE, while being censored by your own country, let me know how easy it is to deal with all the bug reports and *demands* you people make Well thanks for being so polite, you must be the one that respects and serves everyone around yourself so well when you're such kindhearted person They -should- be rights, though. The idea that disabled people should just meekly ask for concessions and take whatever handouts are convenient for the companies who make these apps is such a grim view. Why is it bad to expect more? Also, did you miss the part of OP's post where they went out of their way to ask for it in several different ways? From two years ago: https://reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/9kl6ee/blind_people_are_almost_entirely_shut_out_of/ Normally I agree with you. If I've come across as demanding, that's my fault. I'm a professional accessibility tester; I know a lot of the work that needs to go into an app to make it accessible. The problem is that a lot of that work can be done from the start without significant extra time. The hard part is going back and fixing an accessibility nightmare that was created by a developer who didn't know better. And honestly, we're running out of excuses for developers not to know better. If building contractors need to design according to the ADA (which I believe they do), we should have the same general expectation of developers, within reason. I have spent an enormous amount of time posting nicely out here, writing emails to support (mostly ignored), working with volunteer support to file countless issues, which they put just as much time into understanding and documenting, (seriously, let me take a moment to emphasize that. Volunteer support learned how to use a screen-reader enough to reproduce all the bugs I reported, took my feedback into account, and wrote it all into their ticket system.) And all of those seem to have been ignored.

I'm exhausted and frustrated, and I truly believe we deserve better. I feel like I'm screaming into the wind. Every time I have to do anything at all in the iOS app, I'm met by a thousand tiny paper cuts. I don't want to be demanding, but I certainly don't think I need to be nice. my bad only telegram x become telegram on iOS not android, sorry. No, I just understand that your attitude is what leads to things never changing and that raising hell is the only way things _actually_ change. And I'm tired of hearing the same tone policing used as a weapon against marginalized communities trying to be heard. I understand that what are rights and what are not is a much broader debate, and I do not agree that such a thing should be considered a right (in the sense that it being provided souls not be mandatory). As for the post, yes. Like I said before, I truly hope it comes true as a feature, but there are ways to ask, support, and work for more. Nothing is free or granted, everything requires the work of individuals. Having said that, I too hope this will be delivered as a feature soon, as it would benefit a lot of people. It is disappointing that this has not been addressed by them since then. Like everyone on this community I think this feature should be improved. Besides telegram, are other similar apps addressing this issue? I saw one comment citing discord, so perhaps a solution is already available for that platform. I am saying this because competition may also be what drives them to improve these features. If they are the ones falling behind, maybe showing that they might be losing users may be a tangible strategy to change this with more urgency. Happy cake day! Hahaha. I'm sorry about this, it sounds really frustrating, and it seems you have put a lot of effort into this. I am unfamiliar with iOS overall, my brother and some close friends always used apple stuff but I've never ventured into it. As far as I've read, they had a couple problems implementing several of telegram stuff too, including even the quick round videos, that don't work on Apple devices. Well, in the end it is just sad if it is as easy to address this from the beginning and they didn't. If this was done by several other companies, like the other comment explained, I really think you guys should endorse the apps that have those features and maybe that will work (i know it's not ideal if you wanna use telegram). Unfortunately competition is sometimes the best driver for change. I can't imagine how it feels and I totally agree that you don't need to be nice at all after such bad service, I was just trying to argue that is unrealistic to expect anything to be mandatory for a non-profit venture. I still think this should be addressed ASAP. You're not wrong. Just about every other app is at least usable in the sense that we're not locked out of key features. Most of them are quite good. Discord has really pulled it together recently, and I talk to their accessibility team pretty regularly. iMessage, messenger, WhatsApp, Signal, Skype (mostly, but no-one cares), Twitter, Facebook, Instagram (on good days), Apollo, Threema, even the Matrix app Element (also a nonprofit), all of Google's apps ever, all the work apps like Slack and Teams, Zoom ...
I could go on, but you get the idea. Telegram is the worst out of all of these, and has by far the worst track record of fixing bugs. Since the initial VoiceOver support was added to Telegram after the X update, it's been nothing but regressions and new issues. Even Unigram, the third-party windows app, is fantastic. It's the only reason I still use Telegram, and being stuck on desktop for good access is obviously not great. 

Maybe the downvote king is right in that I should just go elsewhere, but I'm kind of committed now, and the population of Telegram users on Reddit alone is surprisingly high. Ditching it is not a simple thing. I'm sad to read that. It is really disappointing that telegram is behind all those brands on this matter. I hope they will address this soon. I wish I could help more, but I don't have the skills that could be useful for this. 
Please keep the community here updated on this if it is not inconvenient for you. 
Ditching it for other apps is no easy task either, but doing that and explaining why could 'hurt' them into getting better is a possible way (that could be avoided and make everyone happy). I think the unfortunate reality is that we're such a small minority that ditching Telegram would just make a problem go away for them. But if something changes, I'll definitely post an update. I try not to complain without balancing it out sometimes."

Thanks for your reply. This channel has been really helpful. Hmm thank you for the info. I use telegram mainly for tv shows and movies or sometimes music. Do you know if the same applies for copyright or something like that? It depends where the copyright content is forwarded. If the copyright content is forwarded to a private channel or chat it will not be affected by take down. If it's a public channel it will be flagged copyright content. If you forward it without quotes using unofficial clients it's entirely different copy of the file, will not be flagged as copyright content. I still have forwarded files which were flagged pirated and the channel which posted it is not accessible right now. But I can still access them in my ""saved messages"". yup, it will still be downloadable. IDK for sure, but I have seen too many copyrighted contents on Telegram. But I haven't seen a post deleted because of that myself. IDK, but maybe that's because they never get reported! People downloading those contents are the actual consumers of those contents, so you know :)

Finding rules won't be that hard. Nice! Thanks you’re a legend"

I’ve gotten three bot/spammy messages on the app in the past ten minutes. I’ve been dealing with an influx of these for several weeks, but they’re obviously upping the ante now. Anyone know how to prevent this? Is there a way I can block unknown contacts from messaging me, aside from the case-by-case blocking? I’m not part of any groups, haven’t given out my info, etc. Not sure what’s caused this.;2020-11-23 19:10:31;"In Settings > Privacy and Security, you can toggle on ""Archive and Mute"" for new chats from unknown contacts. The messages won't be blocked completely, but they will be archived and muted so it will be less annoying.

You can also delete your username if you think maybe your username was leaked somewhere and that's how they are finding you. If someone doesn't have your username, phone number, or shared groups, then they shouldn't be able to contact you. Thank you!"

Also, none of the tools i've seen have the ability to see who initiated the conversation. I'm happy to pay for the tools or for someone to build them, but was curious if anyone knows of any that already exist?

1. By tracking the message which have most replies and 
2. By calculating the time difference between two consecutive messages.
Correct me if I'm wrong. My brother does such tools Dope bro 👌🏽👌🏽 Yoooo I searched so long for something like this. Thank you! I don't (yet) need it, just here to say that's super awesome! Take my star! I don't see anything for who initiated the conversation. Is that possible with this tool? Or possible to build for a fee of course? yeah, like if more than 6 hours between messages, i'd consider it initiating the conversation basically. also, could go with a few keywords, ""how are you"" ""hi"" ""hello"" etc, whoever sent that first initiated. Not at present.  And I don't currently do contract work, but if you want to file an issue on that project asking for that, feel free to do so.  Since I don't travel due to COVID-19, I have plenty of spare time when I'm not working during the day. contact u/threejin he develops telegram bots, might help you out sorry, i'm not sure i follow. You're saying you don't do contract work, but if i file an issue you'll work on it during your spare time? Why not let me pay you? My guess: because if he accepts money, it stops being a request (for a hobby) and becomes a demand (for a job), and that could suck the fun out of it, not to mention give you more power over him than he's comfortable with."

Using Telegram Desktop on MacOS with an external audio interface;1;jyv8wx;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jyv8wx/using_telegram_desktop_on_macos_with_an_external/;1;"Hey everyone!

Since Telegram released their MacOs Desktop version with the video conference enabled, I haven't been able to use it along with an audio interface. The video works, the audio works (I can hear the ringtones) but I just can't hear the people who call me (they can hear me thought).

The only solution so far I have found is to turn of the audio interface and use the iMac audio / speakers. In the settings I can choose the microphone (iMac or Audio Interface) but nothing more.  


Has anybody encountered that bug also?";2020-11-22 15:57:51;"Same situation here unfortunately - I haven't managed to find a workaround other than unplugging my USB interface. I've logged a bug report.

Is it possible to export the chat history if we already leave the group ?

I just tried it, from the desktop client I could export the chat history of a group I was removed years ago. But of course, I still had the group in my list. If I would have removed it, I probably would have to rejoin it, but I do not know this for sure.

Everything (except secret chats) is stored on the server. One client not syncing - I have no idea, never happened to me. And again, you can just export single chats within the desktop client (three dots -> export chat history) as you like. They remain in that group, unless manually deleted Well, because there's a fight in the group, so I just exit the group in impulse, and no backup the chat, if we can't get the chat history anymore, then nvm."

I don't know how iPhones/iOS work, I have literally handled an iPhone once in my life for 3 minutes, so forgive me if I'm wrong, I'm just trying to help so... 

Did you checked your notifications settings for your iPhone? For example on android we can [set what kind of content we can show on the locked screen. ](https://i.imgur.com/27RqYcF.png)

Do you have enabled the **Passcode Feature**? On android, again, that setting makes all the notifications appear as ""You have a new message"" and that's all. Maybe try notification setting from ios system settings, find telegram, toggle on/off the permission for telegram's access. 

Also, don't know if you tried to restart iPhone. I’m guessing it’s the “Show previews” under iOS settings -> notifications. You can set it globally for all apps, or per app individually. Its a default setting since the introduction of FaceID. You can check it’s behavior if you glance at your phone while you get a notification, your phone unlocks when it detects your face and shows you the message on your (now unlocked) lockscreen.

I had to get used to it as well, but it’s a nice extra privacy feature. Especially if the “glance” works. When my phone is locked on the table before me, I only have to glance down a bit for the messages to automatically transform from “new message” to the actual message. Bonus: You can also choose if you want to senders name to appear or the be hidden in the Telegram settings. Thanks for the help but the passcode feature is off. I have tried both. Thanks for the help though. I have reset the telegram notification settings. When the phone is locked, I see no preview. When I look at the phone and unlock it, it says “You have a new message”. It’s treating every message thread as a secret chat even though it is not. At this point, I’m fairly certain this is a bug with Telegram and not a settings issue. Thanks for the response though."

I found telegram groups with my login credentials exposed and compromised, among with others people. I've reported it, but nothing happened. What can I do?;44;jyk53g;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jyk53g/i_found_telegram_groups_with_my_login_credentials/;21;[deleted];2020-11-22 01:38:32;"You can ‘report’  the group via the Telegram app itself. And maybe via your local authorities, because you found your own data there.
But I am not sure if it helps, you better change your passwords, ensure you have 2FA everywhere and try to find out how it leaked online. Even if Telegram deleted that group (which they won't), your credentials are already leaked. A random Telegram group isn't the source of that data, if it's publicly available like that it's already spread throughout the internet.

Don't use those passwords again, change the passwords on every service where you used the same password, and choose a unique new password for every service. A password manager can help with that.

Also, enable 2 factor authentication on every service that supports it - that way attackers can't get access to your accounts even when they know your password, as long as the second factor (usually your email or phone) hasn't been compromised. check out https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to check your account for other breaches of your data Instead of going after the group change your passwords. It's already too late, your accounts are already compromised. Even if telegram bans the group they'll just create another one. It's also very likely they're just resharing it and not the source. This is like treating the symptoms not the cause (your password management). Did u have tried the police solution? How did you find What is the group in reference?

[Telegram claims they do not respond to takedown for groups.](https://telegram.org/faq#q-there-39s-illegal-content-on-telegram-how-do-i-take-it-down)

How do you reach out to Telegram?

Why is this being downvoted? Does it not respond to the question? Is it not relevant to the thread? Does it not fit the subject of the post? Does it not contribute to the discussion? 

If you're downvoting, can you elaborate on why this does not belong in the discussion? And change all your passwords asap and remove all sessions on other devices of course. I found my passwords leaked in many places. If they are on Telegram, they surely are elsewhere as well. Reporting will do nothing.

Instead, it's good that he found out which passwords are bad so that he can cycle that one out from wherever he used it.

Once I saw how shit I was at security, I did as you said. Now I use Bitwarden to store a randomized 30-digit password for each site, and 2fa everywhere where it's available. The most recommended tips ever. When you found your credentials anywhere change passwords immediately or just change password every month and make password much stronger I can't believe how many people use the same password twice. They do remove groups with illegal content. Especially child pornography. They ban channels, admins, groups, bots, delete content, and there is even content that, if shared, gets you instalimited. It's just very rare when this happens (in % with the average user, not actual time frequency, because it happens every day many times, as they have teams of enforcers). Hello there mate

How did you know your passwords got leaked?

What did you actually search in Google that lead you to your passwords and personal data?

I'm going to change everything to improve my security

Thanks for the post and the answers, it's very important and quite disturbing at the same time I used snusbase. You can use it to search an e-mail address, username, etc., and if it has been leaked, there will be the content of the leak.

I saw some of my passwords there, some hashes, many e-mail addresses, and I looked up my family as well just in case.

This was in January 2019.

Since then, Firefox Monitor and other services have appeared, but I don't know how reliable they are. However, if you want to try Firefox Monitor, do it and you'll see that it will tell you which services have had leaks associated with your e-mail address(es).

If you have a couple bucks to spare, try Snusbase as well as the free ones (Firefox Monitor, Bitwarden's own breach thing, idk if any of these are reliable). Thanks mate, I'll check it out, I'll be changing my passwords just in case they're leaked

I'll keep an eye on this post, it's very useful all that you guys are posting

Thanks again ;) Archive whatever you need for later. Reddit posts and comments can be easily deleted. Everything is fleeting until you write it down :) How do I archive a comment/post?

Doesn't seem to show me that option, but I'm not that familiarized with Reddit yet, so I could be missing some options Use an external tool or save what you need to your own device. Well, I'll use the classic screenshot, it works for me Copy and paste is usually better. Less space + you can search by text. I never thought of that, I'm so used to screenshot (even at PC) that I completely forgot about Copy and Paste"

XD Lots of incorrect information thrown around some fairly big things like MTProto being proprietary (it's not) and the server seeing user messages in plaintext (it doesn't). The kinds of answers you receive on their subreddit are going to be colored by the tendency of the Signal community to stand together. They're the scrappy underdogs of the messenger world and they're going to be vocal about their support.

I wish our two communities weren't so angrily split. I don't have a particular problem with Signal other than Moxie who I find irritatingly smug. It would be nice if we could honestly, openly critique each other without shouting at each other. In my experience, every time the Signal users come out, they point to massively outdated studies on a deprecated protocol or insist on blatant falsehoods like those pointed out in my opening rebuttal. of course, very much interested in reading the arguments for chosing Telegram over Signal, or in which case which one is more suited.

I'm sure many people use both apps and/or are in both subs like us (and/or in the privacy one), so dialogue is possible. The wrong info you're refering to relates to Telegram, right? Yes that's right"

What rebuttal does Telegram Desktop/Web have against pure-E2E messengers?;34;jxt7h4;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jxt7h4/what_rebuttal_does_telegram_desktopweb_have/;32;"It would be nice if the E2E of Secret Conversations could be sync'd through to desktop platforms as well, which WhatsApp and Signal do…

**EDIT:**  Wow, is the Telegram groupthink here this extreme? I'm asking for accessibility, but *literally* every single comment I tried to meaningfully put in here is getting downvoted.";2020-11-20 20:20:35;"To be honest WhatsApp does not sync anything. It’s basically a POP3 client; the client retrieves the messages from the server and the server deletes them immediately afterwards. Does it need to have a rebuttal? They do their thing, Telegram does its own. They've stated that this would slow down performance and make huge groups - something that the app is well-known for, especially among people protesting - pretty much untenable.

Also, isn't E2E pretty much useless in web messaging since there are tons of attack vectors there anyway? Reply to your edit - yes, unfortunately Telegram fans seem to become blinded to the purported awesomeness of Telegram, and don't want to hear anything about E2EE (and Telegram's lack of it from most of its parts).
Proof - my factual post about Signal supporting large E2EE groups is getting down voted. E2E chats are possible with Unigram. *Forwarded from Telegram support:*

Secret chats require permanent storage on the device, something that Telegram Desktop and Telegram Web don’t support at the moment. We may add this in the future. Currently, both the desktop and the web app load messages from the Cloud on startup and discard them when you quit. Since secret chats are not part of the cloud, this would kill all your secret chats each time you shut down your computer. Secret chats are also device-specific and disappear if you log out — considering this, it is handier to keep them on the one device that you always carry with you. In case you are concerned about the security of your chats on desktop, please note that they are encrypted as well and are further protected by Telegram's distributed infrastructure. I'm not sure if cross-device syncing and downloading message history the way it's possible now would be possible with E2E. So really, I'm quite happy with how it is now. If you want full E2E, you can use a private chat. [deleted] What I meant was sync the ""Secret Conversation"" private keys, not the messages themselves, so that way you can continue with the mobile secret chats on desktop. This shouldn't be so hard, right?

/u/vitalker introduced me to [Unigram](https://github.com/UnigramDev/Unigram) which has secret conversations on desktop, but after tinkering with it for a few minutes, they don't appear on mobile! So it's one or the other… I have never heard of E2E being useless, and it doesn't have to extend to the massive supergroups, but small groups of 10 or so as WhatsApp and Signal can do should be allowable. My concern is that we have no proof that they're not secretly reading our non-E2E messages. Signal can now comfortably do groups up to 150 with a hard limit of 1000. All fully E2EE. Wow, awesome! I've just now uninstalled the official desktop platform in favor of this; I'm _really_ liking what I'm seeing, so far. But the E2E chats don't sync with Telegram X, at least, so I will have to check my comp for them… I just don't see why it's so hard for Telegram to officially adopt sync'd E2E between phones and the desktop platform. But Signal Desktop already does it, asynchronously/independent of the phone's connection, so I'm really hoping Telegram Desktop can add this. *Open-source* is what would make for the ""best"" messaging app, and then the next feature would be E2EE-for-everything. I like TG enough to just *barely* tolerate its non-E2EE basic chats, but if TG and Signal could get the best of each other's worlds, I'd move to that successor in a heartbeat. >What I meant was sync the ""Secret Conversation"" private keys, not the messages themselves,

No it doesn't, whatsapp simply mirrors your mobile chats onto desktop. If your phone looses the connection you loose the desktop chat as well It's not useless, I guess I worded myself poorly. It's just that web messaging, in general, is probably the least safe option, so even having E2E wouldn't do much there. On desktop though, yeah, it's a good idea.

>My concern is that we have no proof that they're not secretly reading our non-E2E messages.

You'd have to extend that concern to WhatsApp, since its E2E was last checked when it was implemented some years ago. Hell, any E2E could technically be decrypted if the company runs some shady server code and keeps the private keys for itself. But it's a far-fetched possibility. Yeah, but Telegram's go up to 200,000. Pretty stark difference. This is astonishing: you're literally stating an objective fact and getting downvoted. As a newcomer here, I don't know what to say about the /r/telegram crowd. I aim to continue using TG, but just as a warning to the general public, fanatical loyalty to any one messaging app to the point of attacking *facts* is insane. *Telegram's* supergroups sure aren't E2EE, as far as I know. The E2EE chats from Unigram/Telegram X will never sync , because
1) They're E2EE.
2) It's an unofficial client.
3) Telegram won't make it happen even in the official clients and I think it's a good decision, it makes everything more secure and if you use E2EE then you probably know you're giving away conveniance anyway. The only reason I never switched to Signal honestly is because I like how Telegram let me download messages in HTML/JSON formats. Yes, you're limited to 1M, but that's still more than you can expect. ya don't see why you are getting all the hate.  I feel the same way.  I think telegram is great but my main issues with it are they roll their own crypto and it can't be audited as well the syncing of private chats.

TBH I don't really use private chats but i'm guessing the issue would be incorporating all the features into the private chat.  Maybe they could make a simple text/low rez image private chat that could switch between phone and desktop easily.  


Also the regular chats are server to client encrypted if that means anything for you. That's what's terrible about WhatsApp. But Signal Desktop can receive its messages independent of the phone, so why can't TG Desktop be done the same way? Oh okay, well with web that makes sense then, but the desktop platform… I'm now using Unigram which has secret conversations but those are _limited_ to desktop, so I'm gonna miss messages when on the go.

> Hell, any E2E could technically be decrypted if the company runs some shady server code and keeps the private keys for itself.

I suppose this is where Signal beats both since it's open-source. Sadly, it's such a barren app for not even having text-formatting, and the desktop platform can't even make new group chats… /u/DonDino1's point is that they're not E2EE. *That's* the stark difference. Have you tried chatting in a group with more than 1000 people? It's pretty impossible to make anything out, unless it's a channel. It is astonishing until you realise it happens fairly often in this subreddit. How is lack of E2EE securer? I know it's certainly more *convenient*, but today is all about privacy + security. There is nothing that proves that TG is not accessing our non-E2EE messages. It does, thanks! And interesting; I didn't know that, but apparently their coin died earlier anyways: https://www.newsbtc.com/news/telegram-ton-crypto-investors-refund/ Signal can receive then but don’t sync the messages from phone, so it looks as a new conversation, isn’t it? (Not sure) Just because a group has 1000 people doesn't mean that all of them are talking at the same time. I'm in several groups that have hundreds or thousands of people and I wouldn't consider any of them to be unusable... sometimes conversations go fast but not so much that you can't read them. You misunderstood, what he is saying is that telegram decide e2ee chat won’t sync through your devices is more secure, not lack of e2ee is more secure. Reasons? I think it’s obvious, isn’t it? They actually sync perfectly! I even disabled my phone's data and then talked with a friend on Signal Desktop to try it out. Whenever the phone comes back online, the Signal app receives all messages that were sent and received on the desktop platform, in the same conversation like on any other messenger. Oh. Well, it'd be nice to have it as a per-chat option, I mean."

Almost every competitor has it, and it's an amazing feature I’m not sure if I would like that, but could be added as a feature, yeah. 
It’s in the works, iirc. For sure, but don't do it like twitter and only allow like 5 emojis, do it like discord and let us choose! Well this feature is already available server-side, there are some methods to add reactions to a message in Pyrogram ( a python module to create cli/api bots ), but they're not added to clients yet :'( I don't really like this feature. I prefer to send a response with emoji. There's discord for that For chats? Fuck no. Annoying as hell and disrupts the reading flow.

For channels? Why not. Just use bots for that. 👍🏽 This is great!  Thanks for the effort! WhatsApp doesn't have it I like Facebook Messenger's approach:  you long-press for a quick list of 5 to choose from for easy access, but you can tap another button to customize that list and/or send a different one. ah, shouldn't be too difficult from a data standpoint then, yeah? :O  would just be the UX that needs sorted Why not both?

If anything, the current way replies work disrupt the flow much more. He said competitor 😛 Sure!

Just kidding, it's an old meme. Currently there are no paid features in Telegram at all.

Maybe it's a connection issue? It's really hard to tell what could be wrong just by your description. What happens exactly when you try to make a call? What client are you using?

There is a peer2peer setting to calls in the privacy option, maybe try changing that. It could work around network issues. Thank you for trying. When I click on the peer to peer option (already enabled for ""Contacts"" by default), it just bugs out and disappears. The whole section of ""Peer-to-peer"" just up and disappears when I click near it :/

As far as network goes, I'm on really strong wifi on fibre line that works extremely well for everything else. To answer your question about the call, it works exactly like you'd expect except that neither party can hear the other. Voice messages work fine which is odd though. Peer2peer can be tricky depending on how firewalls and routers are configured even when on a good connection but indeed it's odd. It doesn't sound like a network issue. If you are using the latest version from the Telegram website I'm not sure what could cause the issue. Maybe the support can help you (but keep in mind they are just volunteers). You can fine them somewhere in the Telegram settings. It's called ask a question in the Android App, not sure about desktop right now. Thanks for attempting anyway.

If you need to speak privately with some members just make another group chat with just them... Yes, there are mods aka forks that are basically safe to use if you trust the developer like Plus Messenger but what you are asking for is not possible from a technical standpoint

I think there are clients that hide messages from others if you've blocked them but hiding your messages from specific people in a group is impossible unless telegram implements a function for that on their servers Plus Messenger

Telegram Desktop with iOS not showing channels;5;jx22ka;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jx22ka/telegram_desktop_with_ios_not_showing_channels/;3;"Hello all! I use Telegram Desktop and the mobile version on iOS and I have been noticing a recurring issue. From time to time, the channels I'm subscribed to simply don't show on Telegram Desktop, but they are listed on the mobile app. In the web version, I have tried reloading the page with Ctrl+F5 and deleting the cookies from the browser, but it doesn't solve the issue.

I have already tried different versions of the Desktop app (Windows 10, Linux and the web version on Chrome and Firefox), but they all have the same issue. A couple hours after disappearing, they show again (it's random). I have also noticed that, if I reinstall the mobile application on the iPhone, they immediately show on the Desktop app (it is as if there is a forced refresh or something).

Anyone with the same issue?";2020-11-19 15:47:37;"In case anyone has a similar problem, what I noticed that solves it is opening any channel on the mobile app. After doing that, just reopen the Desktop application, or reload the web version, and the channels will show up again. I'm having the same problem. Telegram web (and desktop app) does not show subscribed channels and the solution that I have right now is to open the smartphone app, open any channel and refresh the Telegram web.

Is there any other permanent solution for that problem? Haven't found any so far, unfortunately. Have been doing that process almost every day so far. I have tried contacting the support, but they haven't aswered."

It's not really a big deal to me though, it loads quick. I don't have any crazy chats groups in telegram or anything so it's curious. so I'm not the only one. I was starting to get the feeling that telegram just hated me. did you disable battery optimization for the TG app? 

and 4GB is pretty low, my Pixel 3 struggled to even keep anything running if the camera or Chrome was used even once Battery optimization is enabled, like for every other app. Yes you are right, 4GB of RAM is on the lower end, but I could close all other apps and only keep telegram open and it would still close and reload. Definitely not a lack of RAM issue since 4GB is plenty for my use case. make sure it’s disabled

and how many chats are you in? more chats uses up more resources, causing issues like the above Not op, but;

Oh God. I'm in so fucking many chats xD. Mainly a ton of archived chats I used to be active in, but don't want to leave haha my old iPhone 5 that's logged into 2 of my accounts takes around 3 minutes to sync all chats. if I've turned the phone off for a while, takes around 2 hours. 😂 Well Same here, maybe that could actually be the issue.

[Q] Telegram group + IFTTT;13;jwd76g;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jwd76g/q_telegram_group_ifttt/;16;"Hello!
I have written a bot running on a raspberrypi,
added the bot to a private group and it's working so far.
how can I allow IFTTT (also added to the group) to run the bots commands?

THX";2020-11-18 13:06:35;"Bots cannot read other bots' commands. Either you make a userbot or you interact with IFTTT API in another manner (server-side) while using your bot to receive commands with you and report on stuff / remind, etc. Other did not mention it but you could use client API, telegram has 2 types of API, one for bots and one used by the Telegram app, if you use the client API you can send messages directly using your account, be warned that those are not meant to be used by bots so if you use it do so only on your private projects as telegram could revoke your API permissions . it's a simple bot for motion detection.
if I send the message manually i get the response from the bot,
I am trying to implement Alexa enable/disable via ifttt and telegram, but it's not working. any advice? Bots cannot read each other's messages, as I said. If you want to automate it, you have to interact with IFTTT server-side (or use a userbot). Why don't you use the IFTTT API in your bot code? i cannot find anything on IFTTT server side, can you please point me to a guide or reference? how so? Google IFTTT API How did you write your bot? With python? There must be a way to control ifttt with python. Python indeed, it's for camera motion which sends pictures to telegram, I just want to be able to enable/disable with alexa command the motion sensor. Alexa -> IFTTT -> Telegram -> Python code -> motion sensor?

That's a lot of middlemen. Can't Alexa talk directly to your python code? Or at least cut out IFTTT. A bot can't see messages from another bot so your python bot won't see messages from ifttt. A good bet is looking directly into the ifttt API to add to your code alongside the telegram bot. You could also have the bot send you a message whenever you turn it on or off using Alexa. i think I could by developing an alexa skill. Are you using Home Assistant on your Pi? no, clean raspbian, with motion installed and python code triggered by motion which sends the images/messages to a group I created via a bot"

Does Telegram give you any in-app warning when deleting the account?;2;jw8awm;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jw8awm/does_telegram_give_you_any_inapp_warning_when/;4;"I had a backup account created using a VOIP number that I was using up until yesterday, and I just discovered that it was deleted. (Had Two-step verification turned on). 

Now, since I did nothing to maintain that VOIP number... I AM aware that someone else could have ended up with my number and have gone through the account deletion process. But doesn't Telegram normally give you some kind of warning/grace period to save your account? How is it possible that the account got deleted within a matter of hours? Especially considering how I only used that account to back stuff up - I didn't actually post anything. 

Anyone have a clue as to how this could have happened?";2020-11-18 06:31:09;"you didn't use that account for a month (which made your last seen say within a month), and when the new owner of the number initiated a reset, you didn't get the 7 day grace period Telegram actually warns you about a deletion request incoming, but accounts can be terminated in a matter of seconds once somebody has access to them. As I have said, I was using the account up to yesterday. I even forwarded some articles for later reading, so there was no way that my last seen was anything other than ""recently"". 

I also checked all the messages - it's not like I missed any notification from Telegram, either. Any other ideas? So.... the most likely scenario for this to happen is that my account's Two way authentication was somehow bypassed first? Or can this be accomplished with the access to the phone number only? 

Either way, this royally blows. Kinda destroys my sense of security with Telegram. I didn't get any warning that I was aware of, and even if I did, the whole thing happened within the 6 hours that I was asleep."

Recovering a group without owner;7;jw5mxl;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jw5mxl/recovering_a_group_without_owner/;5;"3 years ago someone asked if is possible to make some moderator admin if the original owner of the group was deleted.

Someone replied that telegram was looking for a solution

Has anything changed since then?";2020-11-18 03:49:01;"no. you can transfer ownership of a chat but the account needs to be accessible in order to initiate the transfer process. if the account is deleted before the transfer is successful, then your chat will be left without an owner. It's so weird that this is still the case. Telegram could simply make it randomly pick a new owner. Surely that would be better than have no owner and no way to retrieve it. founding a new group is better. You might never know who the new owner of a previously existing group will be, a complete stranger wouldn't be the wisest choice You could always do it like a Fidelius Charm... 

Every group admin with full privileges get promoted to group owner.

For those of you who aren't familiar, the Fidelius Charm is from Harry Potter - it is a spell that involves the concealment of information within an individual's soul (a ""Secret Keeper""). That person then becomes the only one who can then disseminate the information. The people to whom they do so, can't reveal that information, willingly or otherwise.  If the Secret Keeper dies, everyone to whom the information was given then becomes a Secret Keeper and can tell other people, weakening the charm's power. I guess the preferred behaviour depends on the size of the group."

To clarify, by contact list I mean : TELEGRAM CONTACTS Is it possible that those people have you in their contacts? Have you ever inserted someone else's simcard on your telegram?

It seems that telegram is somehow adding contacts that are not really random
They seem to be contacts of a friend of mine that also used the application some time ago
It seemed random to me because I knew no one and a lot of them had a customised name
Adding the screenshot in the main post Can't add the screenshot lol will try later when home but I think you get the point, anyway thank you for the answer, it made me think about it Did you by any chance login your telegram on your friends phone, or else inserted your friends simcard in your phone, or logged in google account of your friend in your phone??

Suggestion - find stickers using key words;7;jvqyd5;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jvqyd5/suggestion_find_stickers_using_key_words/;4;"It would be really nice to search for stickers same way as GIFs. Sometimes I'd like to send a sticker that is related to the subject but I can't find it on time. Also it might not be in my collection which makes it even harder to find.

Right now I'm using emojis to find stickers which is not as handy as using words (tags) for that.

It would be really handy to find all stickers for example by typing ""egg"" and see all stickers containing an egg, scrambled eggs or hatching chick";2020-11-17 13:45:07;"I thought about this in the past as well, but how would it be implemented?  


Emojis are linked to Stickers because the Sticker Pack creator itself is able to link them when they are created. Perhaps you could give creators an option to add keywords as well, but this might not be the correct way either... If the creator speaks a different language, they probably won't type ""Egg"" as a keyword (not even taking typos into account). This method would also imply going back to old, existing Sticker Packs and add keywords retroactively.

Perhaps another solution is to allow the User to manually add descriptions to individual stickers and find them that way... And it could be a nice addition... But you can already search Stickers through the Sticker Pack name itself (and emojis)... If I had to go back and tag every anime reaction Sticker I have, it would be so taxing it would defeat the purpose of convenience. Probably not gonna happen. We've been making bots like @stickertagbot to make up for that. Heyo.
There are certain bots for this stuff.

I coded [StickerFinder](https://github.com/nukesor/stickerfinder) for this exact purpose. But running it as an open service was too much work (too many people adding rape/gore/racist sticker sets and tags).

It's search functionality is still working, but tagging is no longer public.

You can however, easily host your own isntance.
There's also an relatively up-to-date database checked into the repository. Start a message with ""@stickersearchbot "" and continue with any emoji. It's an inline bot that'll list matching stickers from about 6'000 packs.

Has anyone repealed spam ban successfully?;3;jv2itm;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jv2itm/has_anyone_repealed_spam_ban_successfully/;13;"recently got banned on telegram for no reason, at least none I could think of.

So far I've been waiting for response for two days and no response, has anyone actually went through the spambot and successfully lifted their ban status?";2020-11-16 10:09:08;"I managed to repeal the ban before. I explained my situation and about half a day I got a response. Here's my message:

""I’m afraid some Telegram users found your messages annoying and forwarded them to our team of moderators for inspection. The moderators have confirmed that you’ve been sending spam.

Unfortunately, your account is now limited. You will not be able to send messages to people who do not have your number in their phone contacts or add them to groups and channels. Of course, when people contact you first, you can always reply to them. ""

&#x200B;

Apparently it's perma ban. But I've got no idea what, or even when I did anything wrong. I successfully got a one month long limitation lifted in January 2018 by forwarding a message saying ""Pm me"" to the bot from the user who I suspected reported me.

I've been on tg for a while and been limited a couple times, and that's my only successful appeal ever. hi, just wondering what your outcome was? Telegram staff doesn't actually read any of the reported messages and automatically considers it spam the instant it's reported.

An extremely common trolling tactic is for a troll to ask you in a group to PM them to talk about something in private, then they'll report your message as soon as you send it. The temp ban comes within seconds because, again, they don't review anything.

You'll probably have to wait it out unless lucky. I've been sending complaints since the 14th, does that mean they're ignoring me? Every time I get that message, with no citation of what the offending message was. Hi, was there any ban that did not display how long you will be banned for? And what did you do after the bans? Did you switch account or? My ban was lifted a about a week later, although I didn't receive official response from telegram or any of my complaints, I filed about one ban appeal a day, tried to contact volunteer help group once. Ah, that's very disheartening Do you manage to get unbanned? Or do you register a new account? No, that's never happened to me. I just waited out the ban. okay, thank you"
Do I have to know programming languages to create an 'interactive' bot?;15;jv1zhk;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jv1zhk/do_i_have_to_know_programming_languages_to_create/;17;[removed];2020-11-16 09:22:50;"You'll have to do some customisation to get the bot to do what you want, but a lot can be done with no actual coding (or just changing bits of demo code) if you use nodered (& telegrambot).
You'll have to get your hands dirty, or pay someone to do it though.
Also, it's worth noting that the examples you gave would need a server to run on & a database/storage place for the answers. Who's coding/delivering that part?? I think there are bots to make bots like the one you're trying to make, just I'm not sure which are those bots, I've only heard about them.

Although, if you want to go for the sure path, and create a bot which you can configure freely, you have to code it by yourself. Fortunately, you can learn Python to make a bot, which is, in my opinion, the easiest language to learn nowadays :D

If you're willing to learn, I can provide you with some help, cause I know how is it to diving head down into Google to find exactly what you're looking for. 

On the other hand, if you don't want to learn code to make it, I can provide you my services in bot making, for a fee, of course. I'll be really glad to make business with you, sir. basically docs.pyrogram.org :p I'm afraid you will have to write code for this or get someone else to do that for you, if you want a clean bot who does exactly what you want. Not only that, you will also need to host it somewhere, even if it's an office computer running 24/7 or some Raspberry Pi plugged in next to the router.

I've developed my own Telegram Bot API wrapper for node.js and if you're a somewhat skilled dev it all should make sense to you, but it's way over engineered for what you need. I designed it to be modular to support many bots at once with some global administrator capabilities thrown in there to control all bots at once and stuff like that.

Back when I started developing bots, however, all I did was this for a few months:

1. install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. make a new folder with a file called app.js
3. install [this](https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api) module inside that folder using `npm install node-telegram-bot-api`
4. copy the [example code](https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api) into your app.js file (replace the token with your own from BotFather)
5. launch the bot using `node app.js`

And then tinker with the demo code. It uses polling by default and while it is not efficient, it doesn't require dealing with SSL certificates and webhooks and ports and so on. It just works.

It's easy to make a bot who responds with pong after you write ping, but `reply_markup` and `inline_keyboard` are a bit more complicated, as you will also have to deal with `callback_query`s and more. I don't know if said API wrapper is capable of that, as it seems to be abandoned.

You can find all the info you need in the official Telegram Bot API documentation or a up to date and supported Python or node.js API wrapper like the one I started with. Yes. Either you find a bot that makes bots how you want them ([@BotListChat](https://t.me/BotListChat)), you pay someone to do it for you (like myself) or you learn to code and make it yourself. There are many bot constructors which provide standard bot functionality. Yes. You'll need a basic understanding of JavaScript or Python. Thanks for the info and for the offer :) 

I found a bot to create buttons, but it only lets you make buttons providing message responses, not a button opening a website for example. Plus after each interaction they send you an advertisement...

Our parent company already has a functioning advanced bot like this, so when I said ""why don't we ask the people who made that bot to create a new one instead of me who has no experience?"" I was told that it was made by someone in HR with just a little bit of google help. So yeah either they know python and work in HR or someone's out of the loop. Tbh nodejs bots are easier to code than python bots. Fewer lines required and they're very straight forward thanks to eventEmitter. I've made plenty in both languages and Javascript beats Python here.

For userbots, however, Python is better (Telethon vs no big cared-for library on js).

JS is also just as easy to learn as Python and arguably more useful for the web side while Python is more useful for general scripting, AI and other stuff. I simply disagree with your claim that Python is the easiest one ;) **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

*totally isn't a contributor* lol Hmm, I see... 

Well, Python is not the only language to make bots, but maybe someone at your company has some experience too.

Anyway, if you need any help, documentation, or wanna still take the offer, don't hesitate to PM me, I'll be glad to answer c: [deleted] Well, I don't know really much about Js by the bot making part... But I have to disagree with you when saying Js is as easy to learn as Python... At least for anyone without any experience at code. 

And yeah, I totally agree that Js is much better for web related stuff than Python, but since the only web interaction with Telegram is through API requests, Python works pretty well with Telegram bot tool, and as I said before, specially for beginners, due to the syntax. 

In the end, it depends mostly on which language you know the most and you feel more comfortable with. You can get that in one line with js......

bot.command('echo', echoHandler)

With Telegraf

bot.onText(/\^\\/echo/, echoHandler)

With node telegram bot api

Python bots are usually double to triple the file size and definitely don't feel as fluid.

If you just wanna grab a picture or any other update type, you just got with

bot.on('photo', doThing)

It all starts automatically once you initialize the bot while requiring the package. With bot.launch() with Telegraf and the option {polling: true} with ntba.

No Python library that I know has that. I started with js and a week in after starting the codecademy tutorial, I wanted practice so I just launched a bot. I later learned Python and I think learning its bot libraries is much less intuitive. I've made bots with both and side by side, in my eyes, JS wins with ease to make and maintain. 

I'm not saying Python is hard, or that it's libraries are bad, all the contrary. But JS is super easy as well. I don't see much of a difference in their learning process. JS is also directly compatible with json which is just one of the advantages of using it for http API interaction. [deleted] Please misinterpret me more, daddy. I love it when you twist my words. Ooo

I know python bots get started.. Anyway I'm on mobile and too lazy to go copy and paste some code snippets and the proof you so desire. I simply meant that eventEmitter command handlers are shorter.

Ill quickly type a 4-line functioning bot.

    const T = require('telegraf'),
    bot= new T(token);
    bot.hears(""echo"", ({reply, text}) => reply(text));
    bot.launch(); Also what I meant by fluid was fluid to type not to run. Both run just as well."

Any idea how to go about this?";2020-11-15 02:07:57;"that’s normal. if you have a passcode lock on the app, that means you don’t want anyone snooping in the app - which also includes reading your messages from notifications Ahh.. right hehe

Drug Telegram groups;0;ju4zs6;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ju4zs6/drug_telegram_groups/;5;How to find drug related telegram groups in a certain area? How do you define areas in Telegram in generał, is it possible?;2020-11-14 19:52:32;"You may use the nearby feature.

I've read that drug dealers often use this in the US.

However, to find groups, that's a different story (the previous story is for users only). I believe you either need to ask them, ask people around you or Google the keywords with your area, Telegram and what you're looking for (i.e. ""Palo Alto Telegram drug group"")

He careful not to hit an police honeypot. You never know when you're getting set up depending on the legality of your activities and how active their anti drug teams are. Narc Yo thank you do much mate! That was very helpful ❤️ > However, to find groups, that's a different story (the previous story is for users only)

The nearby screen also shows group chats (if any). But I highly doubt drugs dealing groups are created as local ones (although in my area I actually found one that was also quite active) You may want to tweak a bit your phone number privacy settings (settings-> privacy and security) just in case you run in some honeypot chat"

You have to first click stop (block) bot, and then delete the conversation. unfortunately not always. Sometimes you need to block it Or just pick “Delete and stop” (or “Delete and block”, don’t remember the name exactly right now) option when deleting the bot chat.
Otherwise yeah, like said, it won’t stop and you might wake up with that bot chat opened again one day, when it makes some promo post etc. Not all chat engines have this option. In fact, when I started, none did. It's been progressively added, and still I think desktop doesn't have it"

Bruh momento;206;ju1yjs;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/htonqnvzj7z51.jpg;24;;2020-11-14 16:31:18;"Idk if this is allowed here just wanted to share because this was kinda creepy lol. For info my profile pick on telegram is just a picture of a few skyscrapers Pathetic indeed, he did bother to be polite. 

My randos, I’ve encountered so many times, even though I’ve hidden my phone, and didn’t add a username, they saw me talking in a large group full of strangers, they saw my profile picture then decided to pm me by only saying “hey/hello” etc, they don’t even try to tell me what are their intentions, just waiting for me to reply. 
I’m sick of this, instant block and report spam is what they’ll get. 

I mean in these days instant message for me has got to be efficient, you want to talk, you state your business in the first sentence, ‘cause I don’t got time for bullshiting. Sorry but... Only men tend to be this pathetic when it comes to talking to a girl. It's so interesting why is like this. 

No trying to offense, I'm a man, but I can't help but notice this behavior in some men. Well, older ones mostly. Trying to talk so pathetically to a girl without them asking for it. 

Literally the freaking first day I created an account for my girlfriend, some 2 dudes showed up randomly sending porn and also saying abusive stuff. 

Same with my little sister, I was so anxious for the rest of the day when she approached me saying ""Who's this guy?"". 

Not saying women haven't done something like this... But is WAAAAAAAAAAAAY less likely to happen. bruh... I think this is a really funny hook up Ban any of those instantly I don't understand if most people are more lonely or horny, or both I get a message like this twice a day. I genuinely don't understand people who try to use telegram as tinder or something. Bruh he is very horny to chat with a complete stranger LMAO “hi I’m a guy! Jk I’m a girl! Jk peace out” I've had a few random people show up in my contacts, because my friends sometimes change their phone number and their old number gets recycled. But USA and Germany have different country codes, so even if number matches, +code don't. Mystery. it’s most likely one those PM scammers who found your profile from a group that got its member list scraped. if you continued with the convo, they’d ask if you know about earning money with bitcoin/forex 🤣 I have many accounts. I accidentally asked for help in a 13000 people group with an account where I had a female picture at the time (its a joke account). Holy shit, I got like 6 Arabs on 2 minutes. I had to change my picture to a cartoon and the name to something generic. Once I did that, no more messages. (after I blocked the Arabs, of course.)

And her username apparently means ""virgin"" in some country I didn't know before. This also means that I get a new message every few weeks where someone uses the search function for that specific word, finds me, gets sexually aroused and messages me in that language. I've gotten like 3 unrequested dick pics without even answering to them. Agree, this kind of people are just fucking pervs. Disgusting, they should be punished for this shitty behavior. It is interesting but very simple to explain. Evolutionarily, males are the ones actively looking for female mates in the vast majority of human cultures and even animal species, which is due to the comparatively smaller investment they have to make in order to reproduce (in most species, males impregnate females in a few minutes while the latter then have to carry the fetus or sit on eggs for a few weeks all the way to several months).

Males are the ones who have to approach females who then choose the males whom they believe to have the best reproductive potential (e.g. appearance or strength in animals other than humans and also wealth, power, or intellect in humans).

I'm not sure why it's surprising or inappropriate to try to talk to a girl without her request – that's not how relationships work even in our culture… As for the way they do it, that's simply due to a large number of people (including women, whose intellect is actually significantly lower in the upper extreme, yet generally the same around the mean) being intellectually and emotionally developed about as much as apes. Males are also naturally more aggressive (rude and likely to send unsolicited explicit material) due to much larger amounts of testosterone which females lack. Yea. This isnt agaist male its literally just a fact. I think its because many males believe they gotta act like the biggest douche af. Thankfully I myself and everyone I know dont act like this

Edit: Source: Im a guy ? Doesn’t seem like. Those convos start and go to that direction way earlier than this. Seems like that’s an actual rare misunderstanding. It's very simple viewed from a scientific and evolutionary perspective. But what I find interesting is the fact that for the majority of humans who believe animals and the rest of living things and their behavior in this world are an external thing, something that's not related to us. Who believe that we were just given this world, or that we just appeared here. The majority that thinks this way, somehow don't notice how identical our behavior is compared to the rest of life. 

It's amazing how maybe our lack of information when we are born to be able to extract the necessary from the ""cloud of our society"" may lead to a big misconception of what happened millions of years ago and think that we are just ""something else, we're special"" (trusting that what our society knows it's what it's real). (This paragraph is just me with an idea that came to my mind about **""Societies being the way of nature for storing information""** so I could be probably wrong). 

But even if I accept that it's like this and it's natural, those who are a little bit ""more conscious"", have to make sure the next generation of men (or just those already around) have some kind of knowledge of what's appropriate and what it's not. I know that it's about education, you know, ""noneducated men"" are the only ones who present this behavior. But even if their parents are ""educated people"" their child might not be and will develop this way. 

And such **""uncontrolled behavior""** leads to this (in some degree): Rape, abuse of women, allow child pornography to continue (recently in my country a mom was convicted for using his daughter to sell pornographic content to a group of people led by a man from the United States. And most of those who watched this type of content were men.) and related. 

I'm not saying that women are just ""better"", it's just that their way of seeing reality could be helpful for us. To make things with prudence and yeah, just keep being a man proudly (because I am).

I should point out that all this may sound a little bit exaggerating or dramatic in some parts, especially the part of this ""leading to things like rape and child pornography"", but it's the overall idea of what's important: The idea that many men are not conscious enough of their emotional way of doing things, without thinking before, allowing their reproductive parts to talk for them. I'm a guy aswell and I've seen from my own eyes women who were equally as weird as what I can see from the random weird guy online.  
Definitely not on numbers ( I mean I experienced it like a dozen of times, which is kind of what you can get in one hour in Tinder if you're a female  ) but in term of weirdness, yeah pretty much on par.  


Raises the question, is weirdness not very much a sex/gender issue but just simply a human one ? Read it again. They started saying “hello pretty lady I looked at your pic and had to reach out” the. They said they’re “Lynn” a woman’s name and the. They were like “you’re underage nvm” mine strung on the introduction stage for quite a while, I guess it's to get your trust up Welcome to my TED talk... lol Ah lol now i get it"

I don't think Telegram even sends that information to any client. It sounds strange, cause it's to mute or not is a personal choose and telegram will always be for saving personal info lol.
Would u like if owners of chats u r in getting notifications when u mute their chat?! It is not possible. There is no such event. It's either an unofficial client or they're mistaken. There's no way to know if another person muted the chat on their side. Maybe, they use a third party bot for that? . IDK, maybe she is confused. She said she would send me a screenshot next time it happened. Yeah she's probably just confused Bot API doesn't give access to people's notification settings. No, I have a bot in there, but not that one that would do that. Apparently, the notification appears as a bell with a red line through it. No other member of my group has reported this or been able to replicate it. She is using an iPhone, but so are other people. It's really strange. Ye, idk. I thought they might be confused too, but I can't know until I see it. Sounds like something big if true. No, I’m talking about a bot that DMs admins about changes in the group which it takes from groups audit sounds like they're confusing it with a channel's ""send without notification"" feature lol [Screenshot. ](https://ibb.co/k0Y5Pk1) It's the bell with the red line. I do think she may be misinterpreting the notification, but I still don't understand what it indicates. Incidentally (or not?), the message it's notifying her of was sent by my bot. Ye but Telegram doesn't tell bots when people change their notification settings. In order for a bot to dm an admin such information, it would have to have access to it first. Is the covered part the name of a person or a group? Oh, I haven’t read OPs post carefully enough the first time, I thought that they were talking about a situation when an admin muted a member from writing to the group The group Strange. It says nothing. I have a few hypotheses but they're likely wrong.

1. There are messages sent with a ""no sound"" preference to not bother people as they're unimportant. Could this be it?
2. Could the bell be part of the name of the group?

I don't understand why there would be an empty notification. If it has no content, what's it saying? I've never seen such a thing. The bot is a [reactions bot](https://github.com/sgreben/telegram-emoji-reactions-bot). It does that when someone ""reacts"" by replying with only an emoji. Perhaps I have not set it up correctly. I'm new to bots. I code bots. Bots have an option to send without sound. Read this:

disable_notification 	Boolean 	Optional 	Sends the message silently. Users will receive a notification with no sound.

https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage

I'm thinking, perhaps that's it. Bots that require replies are spammy by default and are rejected in many groups because of that. Maybe this developer's strategy to make this bot more palatable is to disable notifications on sent messages and to delete the spam it causes. That makes sense! Thank you for solving this little mystery. Is there any way to disable that particular notification? Either the individual disables notifications for the group (won't get notifs for anyone's messages except replies, mentions and pinned messages) or the bot is kicked.

Even if notifications are disabled, if the bot's messages are replies to the person, the person will still receive those muted notifications. (There is no way to disable notification to replies, mentions and pinned messages)"

Sorry for my bad english.";2020-11-14 02:20:45;"First you didn’t say where the album is stored, in your “saved messages” or in the groups chats/channels

Second, if they are in your saved message then it is an issue; if  they are in groups or channels, then are  the groups or channel owned by you? If not then other admins deleted them, if yes and if you have other admins m, then maybe they deleted them, you see where I’m going, there are many variables here since you did not clarified which situation you are in. 

And since when telegram has a trash can feature?

You can’t delete your messages then restore them from trash can, there is no trash can. 
Unless there is one in a third-party client, which you have never mentioned, I certainty don’t know it.

This is not an effective way to ask problem while hoping it to be solved. If it was deleted from your phone, it might have a cache cleaner app such as Clean Master. They go through your downloads and empty them to save space.

If you mean deleted from Telegram, anyone who sends anything can delete that thing they sent. Even if you sent it, if they're group admin they can delete it, and if it's a dm, the perosn you're talking to can delete your messages.

If you want files from Telegram, I recommend sending them to your Saved Messages and/or downloading them into a folder that i not the default Telegram folder, so that cleaning programs won't delete them by accident. Thank you guys for the answers. My english isn't the best. You might noticed that. So excuse my explanation.
I downloaded the pictures on my phone. It was automatically downloaded to my album. Like I said before, I turned this option on because it was about 100 photos. So telegram created an album in my gallery. I opened it once or twice. After a while it was gone. I only use the Samsung smart manager."

Feature Idea: Volume Normalization of Voice Messages;13;jtihm2;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jtihm2/feature_idea_volume_normalization_of_voice/;0;"Hi,

I regularly get voice messages I can barely hear. Maybe their recording volume is why-ever way below average, maybe their voice is thin, maybe they talk quiet, whatsoever.

If only two of those aspects come together, I can barely understand what they're saying with my headphones on full blast. If there is also ambient noise around me, no chance.

For the respective persons themselves it's a hassle as well, because they tell me that they regularly get the feedback that they're not being understood and don't know how the change that.  


I would be glad if there was a volume-normalization mechanism when sending voice messages. E.g. just a button ""normalize volume"" after the recording.

ios just released 14.2 stable. 12 anything is worthless information to say “works for me, iOS problem”. You have zero context here. 1. Telegram supports a lot of iOS versions, starting from iOS 9.0
2. iOS 12 is still supported by Apple, as it have received an 12.4.9 update in the last month Like I said. Nothing to do with this specific discussion. I have no idea why you keep saying it. On the same Telegram version, but another iOS version this bug doesn’t occur, which proves that it’s an iOS bug, not a Telegram one. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT **YOUR** IOS VERSION RELEASES! YOU ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IOS 14RELEASES! you nut! They reset after upgrade because the App Store require you to support 2 versions past. They all have their own releases. 

I think you are crazy. I just checked iOS releases in the App Store to make sure. They’ve released consistently all year. For iOS 14 They are up to 7.2 in the App Store and they even released an update 2 weeks ago for pinned messages which lines up when this problem started and the pinned message does the same motion animation as the keyboard drawer rise animation. The app itself is the same for all releases"

Obviously, this can very well not be the case either, so take it with a grain of salt; just my ideas of what's happening. I doubt it in my case, I only have like 30 contacts and I know them all personally, maybe if then have had their numbers for decades. Those numbers will die with them. Lol

My numbers heading close to the 20 year old mark, got it back in high school. These people have got your number in their list. Ok, still does not seem like a good reason to notify me though. Then turn it off. If they had the option I would, but they only have one to turn off my contacts, which I do want, these are people I do not know who’s numbers I do not have in my contacts.

They don’t have the option to turn if notifications about random strangers whom may have saved you number a decade ago when you were selling something online and never deleted it."

Hi Redditors,  


When I opened up a users profile, I used to see mutual groups that we were both in. I can't see it now. Is it gone completely or is it a glitch?  


Cheers.";2020-11-13 01:27:05;"What os and app version are you running?

Sounds like a glitch OR the users you checked don't have any groups in common. If a user doesn't have any groups in common with you the groups tab doesn't show.

One the the big ones is AnimeRG official telegram channel. idk when it happens but I've seen it happening atleast with channels. sounds like the channel was deleted manually by the owner No. 
First I got automated popups in the chat saying something like,
""Since the admin account for this channel is not present anymore, the channel will be automatically deleted after 30 days"" then it was gone as stated. nope. that service message says:

“the account of the user that created this channel has been inactive for the last X months. if it remains inactive for the next Y days, that account will self-destruct, and this channel will no longer have a creator.” 

note that the message stays there even if the owner manages to log in and prevent the account self-destruction. so the owner can log in while still having the service message present, then delete the entire channel themselves Yes you're right. Sorry I couldn't remember the exact thing.

As I was told telegram is pretty secure and private.";2020-11-11 16:07:11;"If you have set up a username, you can be searched up inside of Telegram. If you only chat with close friends anyway, you can also just remove your username is you cannot be found. (At least not as easily as just looking up the username) Yeah if they own a bot. Let's say you chat in a group and there's a bot in it. The owner cans see every message the bot reads and even share these messages with others, or send them to a channel. If you use a bot by private message, same thing.

If one of your friends forwarded a message of yours to a group, someone could have clicked your name from it (you can disable this) and chat you up.

I own many bots and have certainly found interesting people and groups through them. Yes that explains it, thanks! Forwarding my message to a group is possible without me noticing it. So it seems like there's quite a lot of loophole in telegram 🤔 It's not a loophole. Just don't join groups with bots that can read your messages.

You can also disable, in privacy settings, the feature that enables people to click your name from a forwarded message.

You can also disable phone number display even to your contacts. I believe this will disallow people from finding you by adding your phone number to their contact list.

You can also urge your chat mates to use secret chat only. This will outright disable the forward feature and any userbot capabilities that would allow anyone to automatically doxx you to third parties.

Default settings are made for ease of use. They're made for what you would call normie, people with no technological background and low privacy customs. If you wish to increase your privacy on Telegram, the features are certainly there. You just have to look into your settings drawer and learn about the ecosystem. Thanks for the information! Yes it's all still pretty new to me and I'm trying to figure out. 

I'm not in any group nor I use any bots. I've just disabled the forwarded message setting (I didn't know what it means before this), so that's a great tip, thanks! 

I've disabled it since day one, but somehow a phone contact I have still manage to find me which I still find pretty surprising. Maybe because I'm in her contact list. I didn't sync my contacts to telegram and I hide my number since day one. I think even if your number is hidden, there's a chance that Telegram is showing you as a contact on someone else. This is because you disable number sharing AFTER you log in for the first time. However, right when you join, Telegram will immediately send a notification to everyone who has your number in their contacts that you joined, and will add your account to their contact list. Then, you disable the number sharing but the notification is already out with your contact information.

I'm also not certain that when you disable number sharing, someone with your number on their list won't be able to find you anyway on their contact list, even if they don't have a notification of you joining and even if they can't see your number when they click on you from their contacts list. I'm not certain about this and would have to research (which I probably won't). Yeah but when I first register telegram I'd have to use my phone number (then set up an username if I'd like). Appreciate your explanation, thanks so much for your help! Yeah. Sometimes it's better to use a disposable number to set it up, change the preferences and then change to your own number if you wish."

Is Telegram This Terrible Of A Program Or Is Something Odd Going On With My Installation?;0;js2hvf;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/js2hvf/is_telegram_this_terrible_of_a_program_or_is/;1;"I'm left scratching my head if this is a designed aspect of telegram since I'm a new user. I installed the portable version on my Windows 10 PC. Every time I restart my computer and open up Telegram all the channels that I have joined are gone.

I don't see where you can save channels. I can't figure out if this software is just badly programmed or there's something wrong the way I'm using it. I've joined a few channels from invite links online. Once I restart my computer and open up the program those invite channels are gone and I have to find them online again every single time to add them back to the program.

someone with my old number joined telegram;36;jrzhoe;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jrzhoe/someone_with_my_old_number_joined_telegram/;17;"apologies if this is has been covered by a previous post.

i changed my number a few years ago, the network seems to have reassigned it to someone else and that someone else used my old number to sign up for a telegram account but telegram is broadcasting to my current contacts that it's me. i guess that old number is linked to my name somehow? anyway, i tried to contact the person using my old number but they refuse to talk to me. i was hoping to find a way to remove my name from the account they're using. is that possible?";2020-11-11 05:32:06;"[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/j6sdgv/received_a_xxx_just_joined_telegram_notification/g80c00k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) is why it happens. I’m too lazy to explain in detail, but this comment explains why. Solution = your friends need to delete your old number ‘within Telegram’ and not merely from their phones. Ah, that's a sucky situation. So, the reason people think it's you is because your old number was synced with their contacts, signed as you. Time passed and they synced your new number but some data about the old one remained, I suppose. This could be easily helped by them deleting the contact, I think, but there's not really a way to stop them showing up in the first place if people have already synced their contact data. Telegram assumes any contact in your phone is the person you say it is. So if you're like me and have your contacts synced to Google for like the last decade and never clear out old ones... telegram will tell you ""so and so joined telegram"". When in reality ""so and so"" changed numbers forever ago. Nothing much you can do about it.  Other programs do the same.  I had a long convo with someone who I thought was my old buddy on snap chat once.. after that I learned if I haven't texted or called them recently it's prolly a lie. Yeah I was greeted ""You joined Telegram"" when someone got my old number.

I think Telegram found my obsolete number in my contact. But... if you turn off that sync how would you find your contacts in Telegram? How does Whatsapp does it? Some of my friends who don't have my old number saved anywhere anymore still got a notification that I joined telegram using that number, is the problem. 😔 I checked all my accounts to see if maybe it was still linked to them (google, facebook, instagram, twitter etc.) but it's just my new number there. Contacts on your phone will show up on Telegram. The sync option is useful when you use multiple devices, where each device would have different contacts. The single Telegram account would sync all contacts into the account. So, it’s not necessary to have it turned on unless you use multiple devices and different contacts. Interesting.  Real questions trying to trouble shoot here.. is there anyone who NEVER had your old number? Like you only met after you got your new one.  Or ate they all people who would have had it at some point? Really? If I close all my devices Telegram account except the phone one and I turn this option off I'll be able to see my phone contacts on Telegram, any OS I'm in? So far all the people who have asked me are from before I made the switch but I am thinking of asking new friends who've ""liked"" my tweet complaining about this if they got the same notification. I'll let you know! Correct. However, not all your ‘phone’ contacts, but, only the contacts who are on Telegram. Open your Telegram on your phone and check the ‘Contacts’ section. This is what will appear in all other devices. Awesome.. I'd bet even if they deleted you there's somewhere in their phone (even behind the scenes) that associates your name with the number.  Unless someone who never heard that number reports it... then it's a weird thing that would be super interesting lol.

Unfortunately  that means they're isn't much you (or the rando who has your old number) can do about it. But at least it only affects people who've known you long enough to know your old number. 

Side note this is why I've kept my number even tho I moved across the country and people make fun of my area code... I've had it since 2001... itd be a shit show of historical contacts. Oh to give you context on programs pulling weird syncing shenanigans. My friend changed his name in my contacts to ""Dr horrible"" in I swear like 2012. About a year later I changed him to Adam like every where I messaged him.  Contacts programs whatever. 

I installed signal this year.  He messaged me and it popped up as dr horrible. ... and like.. I break phones... a lot. I've had soooooo many phones since 2012. UPDATE: None of my new contacts/friends got a notification save for one. It's really weird but I've decided to just let it go. Breaking your phone doesn't matter since your contacts are synced on Google's servers anyway. At least with Android. Indeed but you'd think deleting the contact ANDb killing the phone would it. My point is it didn't. I wonder if he has multiple entries in your Google contacts"

So there's no easy way to convert a GIF to an animated sticker - it's just a completely different design.

Is this just a bug? Or has she actually seen my message?";2020-11-10 21:23:25;"I think she read your message .It will still be shown last seen within a week if she switched her data off and used telegram .I would tell you to call her and ask if everything is okay instead of making this a big issue .. Ghosted you dont need to enter the app to read a msg, you acn read it from notification and there's a ""mrk as read"" button.

telegram mtproto api has nothing to block sending a read notification without sending an online notification.

there's also a read bug where sometimes messages will get marked as read even if no one could have possibly read it (such as when you send stuff to a 1-person group). I once had a bug like that on mobile, but when I checked on PC I found out that it still had one checkmark on my message. Could be a bug for you as well, though I can't say for sure. Last seen within a week displays if you are blocked from viewing accurate online information due to someone's privacy settings. On top of other answers here, she might have a modified/custom client that doesn’t update the presence . simp These two checks only mean she received your text, it doesn’t mean she read it. it’ll display either “recently”, “within a week”, or “long time ago” if you hide your online status from another user, not just “within a week” nope, that means she read it. 2 checks as received is whtsapp. telegram is 2 chcks for read Yes, I just meant that it was possible for the message to have been read long enough ago for it to have switched back to being within a week rather than recent. I think it only remains recent for a short period of time. recent is within a week, within a week is from 7 days to under a month, long time ago is a month and beyond"

    with app:

Telegram bot into Google Script to send a PDF from URL.;2;jr9uxe;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jr9uxe/telegram_bot_into_google_script_to_send_a_pdf/;37;"I have a PDF document I want to share once a week to a Telegram channel (it’s updated on the server side, but link remains the same). I’d like to create a Google Script linked to a bot that could automatically do that for me: I specifically like this way of hosting my code as I get a free way of scheduling its activity.

Problem is: I’m absolutely not a proficient web dev, and I only worked with C/C++ in my life, so I would need some serious help. I’m just getting started with all of this (and I’m already missing my good ol’ offline `int main()` way of programming ahahahaha).

I have tried reading the documentation for `sendDocument` but don’t really understand how to use it, and I think I’m missing the general structure of the source file to use. I have also browsed endless StackOverflow/GForums posts about the subject, but to no avail, given my extremely limited experience with JS.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me with this!

Edit: huge props to u/scriptdecoded for helping me out into solving this riddle! Go check out their great code ;)";2020-11-10 03:08:46;"For $20 I'll build it for you on nodejs, ready tonight. You could do it with Python instead, using the requests, schedule and Telegram modules. 

Checking the URL content with requests, every certain time with schedule, and then uploading it  directly through the bot. Notes

In Google Appscript ensure you have  Enabled the DriveApp service in your script.
View link:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lfA2-6ifpmsEA1jfxiYM-AGTyZCNzF-vnLKyxwNPw28

Give this a try;

function sendD(){
var id = 'File Id Here';

var url = DriveApp.getFileById(id); 
var name = url.getName();
var blob = url.getBlob();   
//{ Or var blob=DriveApp.getFileById(id).getAs(""application/pdf"");}
var chatid = 'xxxxxxxxx';
  blob.setName(name + "".pdf"");
  
  var data = {
    method: ""post"",
    payload: {
      method: ""sendDocument"",
      chat_id: String(chatid),
      document: blob,
      parse_mode: ""HTML""
     
    }
  };
  
  var telegram =UrlFetchApp.fetch('https://api.telegram.org/botxxxxxxx/',data);
} You could also use c++ (because you know it) with libcurl and nlohman-json to create a simple bot. I guess for a bot like that even a simpel bash script would work. Otherwise head over to telegraf.js.org. They have good docs. You can stream the file with the fs module. Hey thanks a lot for the offer, but I would be interested into learning how to do this, and not “boom here it is”. I’m sure you would do a fantastic, professional, functional job that would CERTAINLY be much much better than whatever I’ll end up creating, but where’s the challenge to that? :) Yeah, the problem is that I would need to host it somewhere… Google Scripts seemed a very good FREE option with scheduling capabilities. Hey there, thanks for the code! However, I don't really understand how to use it given its weird formatting and readability… would you care expanding a bit more on what I'm supposed to do?

>In Google Appscript ensure you have Enabled the DriveApp service in your script.

What does this mean anyway?

Thanks a lot again :) It's just me being unexperienced, not your fault! Uhm where would I put that C++ code in order to schedule it? Google Scripts doesn’t support C++. What are you referring to here, instead? I host bots on Heroku, it's free and pretty Easy to use. Even has a manual to set up python projects :D

Edit: Which languages does Google Scripts support? I never used it before

Also, you could try Google Firebase, I've never used it for hosting, but instead for realtime databases, but I know there's an option for hosting from there, and it's also free, so... You could do a little research there if you want something that is free :) Hi, 
I have sent you a link earlier, which shows how the script should be structured.
Copy paste the code and ensure it structured as show on the link.
You should be having the telegram bot token, and chat id. Kindly explore telegram bot documentation on how to get the bot token and chat id.

The file to be sent should be in your Google drive, to get the file id kindly explore in Google search how to get the file id.

Once you have got around the above , save the script and run the script in Appscript, this will require you to allow your script to access/modify your file you intend to send.

I hope you will be able to achieve this swiftly. When you are done it should be a program. You could either put it on a server/raspberrypi and handle it with crontab or just put it on your computer and let it run on startup or something like that. Or i guess you can put it in a aws bucket or google cloud but ihave no experience with that. Telegraf is a nodejs library to interact very easily with Telegram api. Fs is a native nodejs module to create read streams, which can be transmitted directly to Telegraf and over to Telegram. Does it have code run scheduling? Btw I don’t know anything Python, but should be fairly easy for me (coming from C++) right? Ok I’ll try that and let you know! Ok it seems to work flawlessly! If I can ask for one little detail: would it be possible to add a caption to the Telegram message saying ""sending file updated on \[DD/MM/YYYY\] at \[HH:MM\]""? Ok I see… yeah other users suggested cloud hosting solutions. Thank you! Ok and where would I host that, in order to schedule it as described? Hmm... Not sure if Heroku has code scheduling, but if you tell Python to schedule the update check on the site, it could do the trick. 

And yeah, Python is pretty easy to learn, specially if you come from any other OOP language, such as C++ or Java Kindly review the link ,I have added an additional image which includes the date and time variable. On my server but not for free :'D

Otherwise either on a VPS, which are more expensive ($5/month), your own computer or an available server you can find (bound to have downtime but you may be able to live with that), or on a free service you can find, maybe Heroku or a similar one. My experience with free services is one of great disappointment and disgust, so I'd recommend all but that one unless it's your only choice.

Having it on your own computer is not too bad if you turn it on when it needs to be turned on and configure PM2 to start on boot and get the bot running as soon as your computer is available. The remote file gets updated every minute, but I want to send it on a weekly basis… is this possible with Py? After some playing around with my C++ experience and reading a lot of online forums, I think I’ve come up to an even better solution! I will share it with you so you can tell me if it’s good, but I’m facing a final issue: my file name contains accented characters, and they seem to be completely ignored by either JS or the Telegram API… is there any way to include them? Well yeah, as you probably already noticed this is more of a fun project rather than a professional solution to an enterprise problem. I chose Google Scripts because it offered free hosting of the few lines of code I would need, with even scheduling capabilities. Yep, the [Schedule](https://pypi.org/project/schedule/) library should do the work, just telling it to check the content every, let's say, ""Thursday by the 21:00"", and it will check it and do whatever you tell it. 

Also, is pretty human-friendly :3 Regrettably I have not come across this and would not be in a position to assist. Yeah. So I recommend a cronjob with a broad working period, so that if your computer is turned off at 8 am or 9 or 10, the bot can check the day and say ""I'm on time to send this file"". A config file to keep track of last send could be useful.

Anyway. Good luck. It may be a hobby to you but this is how I eat lmao. I can also teach very well ;) Wow that’s great! Gotta dove a bit into Python then. No worries: you've been extremely helpful already, and I ended up editing the file name in order to make it fit!

Here's how my script looks like now, with the document caption instead of a separate message:

    Date.prototype.today = function () { 
        return ((this.getDate() < 10)?""0"":"""") + this.getDate() +""/""+(((this.getMonth()+1) < 10)?""0"":"""") + (this.getMonth()+1) +""/""+ this.getFullYear();
    }
    
    Date.prototype.timeNow = function () {
         return ((this.getHours() < 10)?""0"":"""") + this.getHours() +"":""+ ((this.getMinutes() < 10)?""0"":"""") + this.getMinutes() +"":""+ ((this.getSeconds() < 10)?""0"":"""") + this.getSeconds();
    }
    
    function sendD(){
      var id = '...';
      var url = DriveApp.getFileById(id);
      var name = url.getName();
      // var blob = url.getBlob(); -> this line was apparently slower
      var blob = DriveApp.getFileById(id).getAs(""application/pdf"");
      var chatid = '...';

      var d = new Date().getDay();
      blob.setName(""UPDATE "" + weekday[d] + "".pdf"");
      var desc = ""New post: "" + new Date().today() + "" @ "" + new Date().timeNow() + ""."";

not really. sometimes i would rather be in a very active group chat than one with a bunch lurkers. granted, i think not sharing anything within 30 mins is a bit excessive, but these days considering most online interactions i'm skeptical if i am speaking with an actual person or a bot... The groupchat is based solely on pictures and videos. People share hundreds of them and when someone is freeloading its not fair to others putting in the work. You realize you can just ignore the lurkers, right?

'Nobody can block it': how the Telegram app fuels global protest;70;jqvh9k;Telegram;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/nov/07/nobody-can-block-it-how-telegram-app-fuels-global-protest;24;;2020-11-09 13:46:08;"Isn't it blocked in Iran? But telegram can block you! I was banned from telegram and I've been using them for 6 years with my friends. Their email support is non-existent. I've emailed both recover@telegram.org and support@telegram.org neither has given a single reply back in 8 days. Even tweeted to them, nothing. All I want is my account back and they have terrible support team when it comes to these issues. I love the app, the features, safety, stickers, everything. It's why I want my account back. But their terrible email support or any quick support. My folks would immediately move to Telegram if there was a way to change its chat-list font size. For now, these [English] fonts are so tiny and there's no way of changing them. Font settings only apply to opened messages or messages bring edited. Sad! [deleted] But what reason was they blocked You? On android go to settings > display size. Android settings I mean. Then it makes it bigger everywhere. There are options to change message font size in ""Chat Settings"". Also you can almost fully customize all the colors and fonts across the app via theme edit feature. It is indeed blocked in Iran.

People circumvent the filtering using VPNs or built-in proxy in app known as MTProxy. Nevertheless, you still need to give the address of some server(s) as MTProxy server otherwise the MTProxy isn't going to work by itself. Russia isn’t blocking telegram anymore That's the issue. It doesn't tell me. And they haven't told me. I have not a slightest idea. Other than someone false reported me, they accepted the report without even looking at my account. Like a false positive. I managed a few groups so could have been a bad user I banned from a group, and they reported me falsely. No! It doesn't work on the chat list. Other messaging apps work just fine. Remember, I'm referring to the message chat list who fonts can't be changed. Have you been able to change the font size of the chat list text that first appears when you open Telegram? That's a no for me, on both OnePlus and Samsung. If people can circumvent the filtering, then the government cannot block it. So the title is true Damn i had it backwards sorry Yes! It does work. You just gotta read my message properly instead of claiming that *I* didn't.

Here's some fucking screenshots even: https://imgur.com/a/9cGd7Tt Ah yes. ""Technically"" right. The best kind of right.

Seriously though, most users are not going to have the know how or to do any of this, and they will move on to other (state approved) apps.

I mean you can get around the great Chinese firewall, but how many people actually do that? By this logic nothing can be blocked, because people can installed VPN and circumvent it. Then we can say that nobody can block ANY messenger, so the statement loses its value as it's not specific to Telegram any more. You can circumvent the blocking for everything though, nothing special about Telegram. Look, I was referring to the message chat-list. Not the message body seen when one opens up a contact's messages. I've never been able to change the chatlist's font. The picture you've sent is seen when one opens up a message. That's ok. The fonts on the screen that shows all contacts/groups etc, shown at the start of Telegram cannot be changed. > most users are not going to have the know how or to do any of this

Pretty sure there were some stats saying they have something like 30 or 40 million users in Iran. So, yeah, most users. That's the beauty of the Internet > The picture you've sent is seen when one opens up a message

No it fucking isn't man Fucking open your eyes, jesus

This is the chat list. You can change the android settings. Are you fucking with me or something? I appreciate your help & passion. I really do. But I'll tell you this: my chat-list font size doesn't change one bit! In short, my Telegram simply ignores whatever I set for the chat-list font. Other areas of Telegram work as expected just fine just like other messaging apps."

At any rate, if you have undeleted cache files, you can access them in the directory /Telegram/ (assuming Android - not sure if you can do this on iOS) Im on ios.

If I set up 2 accounts (I'm aware of the requirement for different numbers), will I get notifications from both accounts, or will I only get notifications from my business account if that's what I'm signed into and not see any from family and friends?";2020-11-09 09:51:51;"You will receive notifications for both of them. But you have to switch accounts manually in the interface.
Also when sharing contents from a different app, it will open a chat picker for the account that is currently active (last used). That’s quite a hassle.

A workaround is to use two different apps, e.g. Telegram X and Telegram, or Unigram and Telegram, for business/private accounts."

Playlists in the new update are useless;15;jqhhce;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jqhhce/playlists_in_the_new_update_are_useless/;2;Telegram added playlists in latest update and I think this feature is not functional yet. Yes, if you send multiple audio files together, telegram will group those files. But when it comes to playing those audio files, telegram ignores groups and adds every single audio file in a chat/channel to the queue. I think the whole purpose of a playlist is to have control over what is going to be played.;2020-11-08 22:11:56;"Right now is more like a UI fix rather than a functional one. 

There might be reasons why: 

For example... What if people want to keep listening all the songs on a chat by playing one song, like it always have been. But now they play one but the playlist only has 3 songs, after those end, the music will stop. 

They probably will have to go the profile of the person, search the Music tab and play all the songs. 

So... It might be because of the extra effort people will have to do in order to play all the songs again, as before. 

Maybe it'll get more options in the future to make it more appealing as a ""Playlist"" feature. > Maybe it'll get more options in the future to make it more appealing as a ""Playlist"" feature.

I think this is super likely, that's how they usually roll out smaller features. Do a 1.0, basically, then add to it until it feels better and more usable."

Saved messages in all chat.;2;jqelpy;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jqelpy/saved_messages_in_all_chat/;4;"Hi everybody, there is a way to quit Saved Messages of All Chats menu? 

Thanks!";2020-11-08 19:34:11;"Right now there's now way to hide it :( You can create chat folder now, categorize chats into different tabs. After chat folder came out I barely switch to “all chats” tab at all. You don’t like “saved message “ just exclude it in all your chat folders. 

Me personally can’t live without saved message, so I pinned saved message in all my chat folders just for me to easily access it.

Tips to use saved message:
- You can use schedule message in saved message as a reminder like todo apps

- Whenever you want to send a long text message with media and you want to send it to multiple groups, you can send it to saved message first and edit it till it is done, then forward it to other groups. 
The message sent by you to your saved message can be forward into any chat without the label says “forward from you”. This is huge if you don’t like forward message indicators. That's a bit sad. :(

Anyways, thank you so mucho for the help! Thanks!!! 

Awesome tips :D"

Once you do that, you’ll understand the need of the bot. 

If you type 😝 or any another emoji, you’ll get some sticker predictions. How is this possible? Because each sticker sticker belong to one or more emojis, in order to make it more organized and easy to find. How can that be done? Using the bot. 

How do you organize which stickers belong to a pack? Using the bot, because it’s not WhatsCrap where you have a long list (favorites) and then waste a lot of time searching one sticker. With the bot you can add stickers to a pack, remove them, get statistics even about the usage of specific stickers, and so on

Ps: Don’t forget WhatsCrap stickers are a poor and disorganized copy of stickers implementation in Telegram. I know how stickers work on TG, but I don't think the bot procedure is very user friendly to new users.

You could implement emojis assignment to imported stickers with an UI instead of using commands. I love having my stickers separated by packs, but in this particular case maybe we can automatically create in the background a personal pack, to save your fav stickers including the imported ones."

Anyone noticing on telegram that it doesn’t show previews of IG videos?;23;jpgle3;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jpgle3/anyone_noticing_on_telegram_that_it_doesnt_show/;27;I usually save videos from IG by posting them in telegram to save to camera roll but the preview doesn’t show for any public IG accounts i copy the link too. Anyone know how to fix it?;2020-11-07 03:06:05;"IG probably changed something and broke Telegram’s previews I wouldn't be surprised if Facebook intentionally changed things up to screw with the previews on Telegram. telegram team probably will fix it soon, they’ve fixed this several times now.

Since facebook broke Instagram months ago, that you have to login in order to see Instagram posts, I guess telegram was using Instagram API to provide the preview now, the sessionID will expire every 90 days, I'm guessing last sessionID's 90 day is up? you're right. I'm not able to do it anymore. however i use this app to download from ig and pretty much any website or app (even twitter) but it doesn't work on reddit tho https://www.videoder.com/ It keeps happening on and off, sometimes it starts working sometimes it stops working. When FB acquired Instagram, they immediately blocked link previews on twitter. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was another dirty move like that, because guess what? on WhatsApp previews work perfectly (and on Telegram every other website works as well). Update: previews are back but there’s a catch. 
They only show the FIRST photo of a post. If you want to look at the others you still have to click IG’s link. Clever. 😒 It’s the same as the link copied from Facebook. No preview is shown on telegram. It works perfectly fine on WhatsApp I have noticed it. But some Instagram videos do show reviews in Telegram. Example: [this one shows a preview](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEn5ZRLBF8J/?igshid=13wg5f7c8qz0z), [but this one doesn't](https://www.instagram.com/p/CI3FF2fp6dh/?igshid=3nat1qegpp7). The second one only shows a picture of the video. So I guess somehow the Telegram app doesn't recognize it as a video? i have a feeling its their linking with facebook bs.

i wonder if theres a way to fix it. i updated both apps thinking it would fix, to no avail. thats my current theory. telegram is fun
facebook has a strict no fun policy thanks. i hope so. theyre killing one of the best parts of telegram thanks man. they dont have it for iphone right? all i’m seeing is android and pc. has it worked on and off for u in the past couplr days with the mst recent updates? it worked for me before i think its bs ig can now send stuff to fb. i think that may have messed it up. idk much about tech with that stuff
but i think that threw it out of wack i think its bc*
not bs seems to be working again link previews are generated by telegram servers, so it’s up to telegram to fix it So for you instagram previews were one of the best parts of telegram? 😜 Guess ""you don't deserve it!"" 🤣 I've never used an apple product so i don't actually know. Yea it randomly starts wroking, randomly stops working like it is now. I am hoping telegram is looking at it. Hmm... which OS are you using? I still don’t see anything different. allergic to apples? lol jk i’m on iphone 13.5.1
its not working all the time
but sometimes it does
its working a lot more though I’m on iOS 14.2.1 and it has been a month since last time it worked. 99% sure this is an INTENDED MOVE by Facebook because they’ve done the same thing on twitter several years ago. why do u think that is? Because the feature limits visits to IG. I.e. they get less traffic -> less revenue. 
They blocked previews on twitter almost immediately after FB acquired IG, so it’s not surprising at all."
Instagram link preview;5;jpe8wb;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jpe8wb/instagram_link_preview/;4;This feature is really blocked now , anyone still accessing it ?;2020-11-07 00:49:12;"Not at the moment. It has happened in the past but has always been fixed. I still fear, however, that’s intended on Facebook’s behalf, because, how curious! on WhatsApp previews work correctly and, on the other hand, previews from other sites work correctly on Telegram. 
Hence, it’s Instagram and only Instagram’s fault, and it’s really troubling. (They did the same thing with twitter many years ago, literally just a few days after FB acquired IG) Damn I thought it was just a bug in my phone or my slow connection. I have a couple of days noticing that its now loading images or videos previews from instagram. It's still not fixed..."

Telegram Ordered To Pay $625,000 To Lantah After Dropping GRAM Trademark Lawsuit;49;jnzw6w;Telegram;https://allyourfeeds.com/blockchain/news/telegram-ordered-to-pay-625000-to-lantah-after-dropping-gram-trademark-lawsuit?order=recent;9;;2020-11-04 19:37:31;">The small tech startup owners claimed the GRAM trademark belonged to them as it has been registered under their name by the US Patent and Trademark Office in the late part of 2017.

Well Telegram fucked this up. [deleted] I mean, maybe. If they were working on the project prior to that they have just as much claim to the name. I'd say dropping the lawsuit is just cheaper than continuing. I mean, the article is pretty clear, anything specific you don't understand or you just didn't read it? [deleted] Laziness must persist!

Telegram planned to build telegram open network (TON) - blockchain controlled p2p network for decentralized form of proxy and hosting service where users would be rewarded GRAM token for renting out their free storage space and bandwidth. (think Pied Piper without middle-out) Lantah LLC had trademarked ""GRAM"" token name and telegram challenged the trademark in court. In the meantime, US Securities and Exchange Commission bravely stepped in and protected vulnerable investors from their voluntary risky investment, shutting down TON. ^^^EDIT:^^^if_not_obvious \s

Today's news: Telegram drops the lawsuit over GRAM trademark and has to pay costs and compensation to Lantah. > US Securities and Exchange Commission bravely stepped in and protected vulnerable investors from their voluntary risky investment

That is an uhhh interesting way to present things. Those poor multimillionaire investors who *clearly* don't know what to do with their money, must be protected. Especially ones that aren't in the USA and missed out on the opportunity thanks to the SEC. I'd love a proxy that pays you for sharing your bandwidth. I use one, but payment is very low Enabler! I'm quite certain that they are being sarcastic Yeah, and geofencing would become extra difficult. I had high hopes for it even as a payment system. Integrating stablecoin exchange and fiat payment processor telegram would create western decentralized version of we-chat, with clean API, and stickers! It's a shame..."

Did she delete Telegram or block me on her phone?;0;jnrvmq;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jnrvmq/did_she_delete_telegram_or_block_me_on_her_phone/;10;So I have this friend who lives states away that I met online who has completely went silent on me for 6 months due to the stress of the current situation with Covid-19. I found out about Telegram from something else and when exploring I saw Add Contacts From Phone on and added her/connected, but never messaged her. It said she was Last Seen A Long Time Ago. I get on tonight to see if she's been back on, but she's no longer listed under my Contacts. When I click Invite Friends it tells me she has 13 Contacts on Telegram, but when I typed her number it says she doesn't have Telegram. Did she uninstall the app or did she block me on her phone?;2020-11-04 09:40:57;"[deleted] sounds like her account was deleted You right if she deleted her Account he would see ""Deleted Account"" on her profile so that he would know that she deleted her account
But if she blocked her he wouldn't be able to just see her profile picture and her last seen would turn to ""last seen a long time ago"" Turns out for some reason everyone on my phone contacts is missing now, and when I try to invite someone on my list no names show up I hope so. I'm holding out hope she will come back to me at some point. The month before she went  quiet on me I sent her an Instacart dinner order with Flowers and wine from Publix because of stress from Covid. She was ecstatic after being stressed out. Between then and two months her life flipped upside down. I want her friendship back in my life. Don't be desperate man, nice gesture but I'd let her come to you at this point. If she wants to say goodbye I just want answers.  This friendship was beyond anything I have ever experienced. Best friends for 3 years talking non stop. She would call me every single day a lot of times 2-3 times a day, before work/lunch/leaving work. Average phone call two hours with longest call being 8 hours. A lot of times when she would go out to eat she was always on the phone with me the entire time she ate, and on the phone when she went shopping. She started buying birthday for me and Christmas gifts for me and my daughter. Sent my daughter souvenirs when she traveled to Egypt. She makes 100,000 a year while going for her Master's and I take care of my elderly disabled parents with no degree, and she turns to me for work/career advice and school. She drove 3 hours to see a concert, and drove with a teddy bear I bought her for Christmas strapped to the headrest of the passenger seat. I knew her family would be affected by Covid and she would be responsible for helping them so I sent her the delivery as a pick me up. If you actually read this you can see why I'm desperate for this friendship. I'll never experience anyone like her again, and she's secretly won my heart even though I never can act on it I don't want to lose her. I did read it. And I just read it again. I totally get what you're talking about here, but I personally think you're going about it wrong. She likely downloaded Telegram like vast numbers of people did when the coronavirus began, found a better app and moved on. That being said, if you've reached out to her on Telegram I'm assuming you've tried other avenues of contact. Perhaps she hates you, perhaps there's good reason to. If the camaraderie were mutual, wouldn't she have reached out by now? I don't know you, I'm just making rude assumptions. But if I were in your shoes, I'd go directly to the source of the confusion and find out what's keeping her from getting back to you. I've actually given her space out of respect. She's very weird in the sense I know the darkest of the darkest, lowest of the low, things people would have killed themselves over less. Sometimes I know her own body better than her if you know what I mean. Sometimes she can so silent over minor things and shut everyone out Including her very painful family. I gave her over 2 months of space after she said she needed it which was a month after her surprise. I finally reached out on her phone and just asked what the heck is really going on. All she replied was that her mom just had back surgery, her life is flipped upside down and her energy is on her family! She was getting ready to take her very last class for her Master's before our break and supposed to graduate in the Summer. She had an A in every class for her Degree and got an Honor Society invitation so she was doing great. She's not on the graduation roll call for her school so something serious happened that interfered. She grew up as a Muslim immigrant child in America that wasn't allowed to have feelings or emotions because she would suffer abuse and never has truly learned how to cope with them. Missing childhood basically. When we were together even though distant she got to be that whenever she wanted. I bought her a Scarlett O'Hara Barbie for last Christmas because it was the one thing she wanted as a kid she wanted most even not having much. When she opened it her face lit up like an 8 year old girl and it was the best present ever she said. Last Fall, I literally shipped her a box of leaves, pinecones, and Hot Cocoa because she can't experience Fall where she lives, and she missed it. We had that type of relationship. Thank you for entertaining my stupidity I see. Maybe I pegged you wrong (not that you care), I hope you can get in touch with her and resolve whatever might be going on soon. Best of luck to you man No worries I didn't take offense to anything you said.I hope so too. Thank you for letting me vent. I know it sounds freaking insane to say about someone you haven't met, but like I said we've been so close that I know her little annoying habits as if we lived together. I know her through and through and I would marry her if I could. Things she has said and done if I did them I'd be accused of being romantic. I bought her 24 Roses when she started her new job last year, and she kept the gift card hanging on her wallboard for over a year. Absolutely nothing special about the card, but she kept it where she would always see it."

The ""subscription"" is for receiving messages, and typing /off will stop the bot from sending messages to you without you sending a command first. There is no money involved.

To pay money, the bot would have to send an invoice, which would trigger a payment process that occurs outside the chat screen. Don't worry, it's a standard message for all bots made with Manybot platform. The ""subscription"" only means that you will receive broadcast messages from bot's owner.

Just nevermind. If you don't want to receive messages from that bot, just block it and delete chat."

After switching from a good battery phone to a more ""modest"" battery phone, I realized how much the telegram battery was being consumed.

&#x200B;

this capture is from a 3º program, but the data is the same from settings.

&#x200B;

I have tried everything from my telegram account, disable the service in 2nd plane, remove self-discharge photos-video with data and wifi.

&#x200B;

I also removed many channels that sent many messages a day, leaving it practically empty. But even so it still consumes a lot of battery without using it.

&#x200B;

Curiously, while using a huawei, it warned me that my telegram was consuming a lot of battery, a few days later I gave the mobile to my girlfriend and with her account she has never warned her that her telegram is consuming a lot of battery.

I start to believe that my account has some bug and I was thinking of deleting it. I have tried to use another client as a plus messenger but it also consumes a lot of battery even without using telegram.

android 10 - one plus 6 - telegram last version";2020-11-03 04:39:05;"My phone (Android 10, Xioami 9), telegram take 4% battery on average. At least it's *only* 19% for you. I'm regularly getting 25-50% battery drain just from this retarded messenger on a Moto Z2 Play...   

And when I installed it on my old Moto G just to see if it was any different, telegram hung and froze the entire phone regularly. As in phone not responding properly to input (short tap on home button, and it acts as if i long-pressed it etc), ""app not responding"" popping up for all kinds of system apps and telegram, insane battery usage (50-90%!) and warming up, and in two cases it froze the phone for so long the internal watchdog timer rebooted the phone! I've dealt with my fair share of trash apps before but Telegram definitely takes the cake It's the same on iOS unfortunately. Why do the Euros use commas as decimal points instead of periods? Well, I see it's not going well for you either.

I have tried to do several things such as removing channels, disabling multimedia auto-delete.

It's a pity because I really like telegram and I have always defended it against whatsapp. But if a single app overloads my phone so much it's not worth it. We do as well in South America and actually if you look at the map, its like half world do with comma and half the world do with dot

You can delete other people's messages in private chats;3;jmtqyz;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jmtqyz/you_can_delete_other_peoples_messages_in_private/;5;"OK, THIS IS A RANT. IF YOU DON'T LIKE READING RANTS, DON'T READ THIS POST.

I just discovered this feature. For some reason, it never occurred to me to try to do it, although this exists since about a year ago.

What this means is that a person can delete MY MESSAGES IN MY DEVICE in our conversation, without me knowing about it. This can be used to change the narrative about past conversations, to gaslight and manipulate. And this is really serious.

I love Telegram in every aspect possible, and I always recommend it over other messaging apps for casual use, but this is really a game changer for me, in a bad way.

This is supposed to be a privacy feature, but giving the control over my messages to someone else is not exactly whay I expect as privacy...

This is just my opinion, but I would consider this feature cool in a secret chat, as I understand the benefits of it, but in a normal private conversation? NO WAY.

I will still use Telegram for groups, channels and secret chats, but for normal stuff and conversations with friends, family and partners, I can't go with this.

The situations where this feature could cause a lot of harm are too many to ignore them.

Am I the only one who sees this as incredibly bad? Did you know this existed?";2020-11-02 21:57:03;"I love everything from Telegram, expect that thing Really? I actually like it this way. Privacy focused, so you trust your ""friend"" and your ""friend"" trust you, against outsiders.

If you can't trust the other side of the screen, why you keep the chat?

Even if you say that can be deleted, you can edit them too, then its expected the chat may change.

Secret Chats are awesome, but the normal chats need to be safe place, so IF something happens with some device and another individual get access, thats the ultimate chance to keep things private.

To keep some messages unchanged, try forwarding them to Saved Messages. I agree. But this is not new, and will not be changed. The devs have stated this is the way it is now. For """"""privacy"""""". Yeah this really sucks. I wish they would change this to just being able to delete your own messages and delete theirs from your device, but not from the cloud. Like discord"
Is it true that telegram does have e2e only on secret chats?;50;jmtl88;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jmtl88/is_it_true_that_telegram_does_have_e2e_only_on/;49;It seems like a silly question and I might get down voted. But still I am asking. I have heard that telegram only have e2e in secret chats while whatsapp have e2e in every where. But why is that so.? Can't telegram eneble e2e every where?;2020-11-02 21:49:05;"WhatsApp claims to be end-to-end encrypted, but their code is not open to independent review. So that encryption is only according to them.

Let alone that end-to-end encryption is only while it's being sent; chats are backed up unencrypted after they've been delivered to the phone. And the backdoors it has. Voice/video calls are encrypted as well, people tend to miss that. [They address this in the FAQ.](https://telegram.org/faq?setln=en#q-why-not-just-make-all-chats-39secret-39)

When something is end-to-end encrypted, the private key has to stay on the local device. So backing up the chats would also have to back up the according keys. End-to-End encryption has nothing to do with the strength of the encryption; cloud chats and secret chats all are just as much encrypted, the only difference in secret chats are encrypted with keys Telegram does not have access to. You can't have E2E encryption on a chat with a server. Many people don't recognize the difference between E2E encryption and Encryption. 
.
The cloud chat is in fact encrypted. But it can never be E2E. True, however they claim that normal chat are also encrypted but in their cloud. You’re right, it’s only E2E in secret chats. But what’s wrong? Is Messenger or IG E2E? No!!
WhatsApp sucks also for being E2E, more than a security feature, it’s also a BIG limitation not to be feature rich. Why do you think you can’t use WhatsApp desktop or on another devices without phone connected to internet ? Because it’s E2E. Also because that company sucks and makes nothing by pleasing its billions of users. 

And don’t feel disappointed, WhatsApp backups rely on third party cloud providers and are not E2E encrypted 😉 Yes and yes they can, just look at Keybase Short answer: Yes

If you want full **e2ee by default** use Signal It's pretty clear only secret chats have end-to-end encryption since they have so many great working native Telegram clients on basically every platform. You wouldn't be able to seamlessly access your chats everywhere with end-to-end encryption enabled. WhatsApp has end-to-end encryption but they have bad clients only which have to connect to your phone in order to work. Most of the Telegram code is open source so people would be able to review the encryption strength of Telegram, even of the ""normal"" chats. In my opinion you can trust Telegram enough and the amazing clients are a big plus. Yes. yes, otherwise the cloud download of the chat would not be possible. Telegram has e2e everywhere. The difference between normal chats and secret chats is that the normal chats are sent like User-Server-Reciver. In secret chats it's sent from User to user. [https://telegram.org/faq](https://telegram.org/faq)

So basically:  
Voice and video calls are always E2EE, the rest IS still encrypted, but in the cloud. It allows us to use Telegram on multiple devices and securely backup our messages. You can start a Secret Chat that IS E2EE. It's still extremely secure, it's all in their FAQ and Advanced FAQ + if you have any complains you can e-mail them at [security@telegram.org](mailto:security@telegram.org), they respond very quickly.   


But tbh, if you're caring so much about your security and privacy that E2EE is a must-have, you shouldn't use a centralized messaging platform :D So that argument is invalid. For 99,99% users Telegram is muuuch more than they need. Balanace between complexity of code which would likely cause more bugs and lower performance. It also makes sense since Telegram is a cloud based service so sharing information between cross platforming would likely add unnecessary development time.

If you want e2e then use the secret chat with a person who care about it too along with some IP hiding service as Telegram logs IP up to a year I recall. Calls and video calls are also e2e. If every chat was e2e, you couldn't have them on more devices (unless they synced after every message sent/received...), because well, that's the whole point of e2e. But you can trust Facebook, why would they collect private data. 

/s > So that encryption is only according to them.

https://twitter.com/moxie/status/717375035946577922?lang=id

You go ask him, he created one of the best E2E in the world, acknowledged by many.

Conversely, he bashed Telegram as well in his twitter in that link. ""Only"", uh. Cloud chats are at telegram disposal and they might have been profiling you for years, hell, for what we know they might have been selling your data too. Also they can bullshit about how much the data is encrypted on the server all they want - if the server can access it and turn encrypted gibberish to plain text data for your client to consume and display, there's a way for potential attackers to recover the data in a scenario where they gain access to the servers. Which for what we know, might have already happened. I don't want to be the guy that wears the tinfoil hat, but all the talk about telegram cloud chat being secure is just pr stunt that nobody should ever trust. If you have to trust the server, the service is compromised from the beginning. Also, consider that if Durov ever runs out of money and is forced to sell the service (which I would rather see shut down and I'm confident that's what durov would do, if he's actually loyal to his values, considering how many thousands of terabytes of data people gave telegram over the years), whoever buys it will too have access to years of chats history we're happily donating telegram over the promise of being private and secure

Edit: this sub is incapable of accepting the truth, but I take it, I've been a bit salty with this comment. Telegram is guilty of years of misleadingly self-advertising itself as a super mega secure encrypted messenger where allegedly nobody can read your messages, and this resulted in this widely widespread idea that your messages are not accessible even to Telegram engineers. This is both the result of Telegram being one of the first commonly adopted messenger in the market with e2e encryption (even if it wasn't the default), but also this misconception comes from Telegram not being very transparent with its users about what kind of encryption it uses (standard MTProto is TLS-like encryption level where stuff is encrypted in transit and accessible to the server who can do whatever it pleases with the data) and heavily using the word ""encrypted"" as to imply you were the only one able to read the chats. Incompetent media coverage (especially in 2013/14 till now) did the rest. I applaud Telegram for being stoic in its fight against oppressive regimes, where people need to organize and coordinate anonymously and en-mass, and I believe Durov is driven by the right values, but I do not trust no engineer that says that his structure is so invulnerable and fail-proof that sensitive data doesn't need to be e2e encrypted excuses. Matrix/Element has e2ee while keeping history and being user friendly So could block chain be used? signal does e2ee group chats. in my experience it is horribly unreliable with more than 10 or so users (unhelpful error messages, out of order delivery, missing messages, etc) That's right. A short but concise answer > Why do you think you can’t use WhatsApp desktop or on another devices without phone connected to internet ? Because it’s E2E

this is simply not true. signal is e2ee and you can use it on your phone and/or desktop. it doesn't work with whatsapp because whatsapp is shit K thanks for explaining These fucking backups are a pain [deleted] What? Keybase can do what you claim is impossible [https://signal.org/blog/there-is-no-whatsapp-backdoor/](https://signal.org/blog/there-is-no-whatsapp-backdoor/)

Doesn't he also claim Whatsapp has no backdoor?

/s That was four years ago, when he helped implement it. Since then, nobody reviewed it and nobody checked whether the system they put in is still intact. At this point in time, there is no guarantee WhatsApp has proper E2E without a backdoor anywhere. I dunno why everyone seems to miss this, but Telegram state that messages (keys?) are sliced up and stored across several countries / jurisdictions intentionally, so that someone who, for example, raids them and takes a room full of servers still wouldn't be able to access user messages. May be you are right, may be not, but in all the years Telegram exists there was 0 incidents of any privacy issues from the team themselves. As Durov stated himself: cloud chats are just more user friendly for 99% of users. Can't say same about WhatsApp/Viber/Skype. Telegram is just a good chat app with ability to create super large groups/channels with more privacy options then other similar apps and with built in options to bypass country specific internet restriction for apps. For privacy related questions sure it's better to use fully open sourced apps like Signal. This sub is blind with the e2ee issue. If Keybase does it, I'm sure Telegram can. Love (not) how you're down voted when you are the only one who says it like it is. Telegram fans don't seem to want to hear the truth. Have you avoided your medicine lately? Jeez! You’re right it’s not true, but not totally false. E2E definition gives you the answer itself. It’s from ONE device to ANOTHER device only, not many.  Things made by Signal (prefer it) and WhatsApp are tricks to do it multi-device.  

And please confirm it: before using Signal in another device or desktop, you have to make any kind of sync to have your messages there, isn’t it? Yes, but they showed e2ee and sessions on multiple devices is possible. And so far (years after implementation) there's no proven WhatsApp's backdoor. > Telegram state that messages (keys?) are sliced up and stored across several countries / jurisdictions intentionally

As far as they do not release the servers sourcecode, this will remain a proof-less claim. I would love to be disproved though. Anyway, even if that actually was the case, the server has ways to gather these keys and decrypt content. It's constantly being done, because of channels/groups analytics, reported content that is submitted to the platform moderators, and more - the server handles plain-text/unencrypted content all the time, an hypothetical malicious attacker can find out how it's done and potentially gain access to this unencrypted content. But how hard would it be? The task is probably a pretty hard one on its own, but we don't know how much harder tg's infrastructure is actually making it. Again we're left with the only choice of trusting Telegram's claims that storage encryption keys are being split across the globe and that no internal/external attack has ever succeeded and Matrix does it while being federated Well, no. End-to-end encrypted group chats exist, also in WhatsApp.

To make end-to-end encryption multidevice you need to always have group chats (each client is a participant). _Element chat_ does that. you can't see old messages on new devices True.. yet, Russian federation requires telecom companies to store encryption keys and provide them to the federal security service upon request. telegram is banned in Russia because they refused to do so, yet miraculously Whatsapp is alive and kicking in Russia. 
This is just one example. it is also a pain to use imho Guess why? E2E 🤷🏻‍♂️

Signal DO respect the principal of E2E (I mentioned above). And what’s the price? You won’t have your messages synced everywhere in all devices as in Telegram, so we can indirectly “blame” E2E for that. 
In Telegram your have everything synced, what’s the price? Not e2e, but I still trust it muuuuch more than WhatsCrap and feel safe using Tg. >  telegram is banned in Russia 

No. It was, but now it's no longer banned, for no reason of course. Suspicion is still valid for Telegram as well. Do they give Russian Fed the keys they want?

https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295535/russia-telegram-ban-lifted-security > telegram is banned in Russia because they refused to do so, yet miraculously Whatsapp is alive and kicking in Russia

Do you know why? Because Telegram can actually access all the cloud chats content with 0 effort and hand it to the government, while on paper centralized e2e messaging platforms such as WhatsApp has no way to access user content, except for metadata. Not trying to defend WhatsApp, I would never use or suggest it over Telegram, it's just that your claim is ignoring the context: Telegram can actually access all the messages sent using the service In element you can set e2e encryption and you can see the previous messages on a new device message synchronisation is overrated. i wish i could set auto-destruct on regular, non-secret chats in telegram To be fair, the ban there REALLY didn't do anything but make people frustrated at the people that implemented the ban. If I remember correctly, the Russian user base was increasing at almost the same rate as it was pre-ban after a dip while they were working on proxy infrastructure.

But I don't have a source for that right now, so take that with a grain of salt."

Short answer... I do not want telegram vibrating my phone.  *EVER.*  Vibration to me means something important, so phone calls or texts from my troops, not the telegram messages with my friends who can wait until I have time.

But even though in-app, I have vibration disabled and priority set to medium, telegram keeps vibrating when I get notifications.  I've gone into system settings and keep making contacts silent, but I've now noticed that people in the notifications dropdowns are actually duplicating.  Let's say we have Joe and I set him silent, then he messages again and it vibrates... I go and look, now I see Joe listed twice in the system settings granular notifications list.  Prior to this version of Android, when granular settings didn't exist, I could just turn off vibration completely for telegram and notifications were fine.

I had this same problem on my Galaxy Note8 prior to this and it never worked right, so I had to completely turn off notifications entirely for telegram.

Screenshot in secret chat;4;jmqmru;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jmqmru/screenshot_in_secret_chat/;21;Someone took a screenshot of the image that I send even after I set the timer to 30 secs in secret chat.How.is that possible?;2020-11-02 19:26:03;"They might have a client or device that does not honor an apps request to not allow screenshots.

Telegram tells your device to not take a screenshot or record the screen in secret chats and their phone might not respect this, taking the screenshot anyway. iOS allows them to take screenshots, but shows a notification that they did it. It is just a deterent. it doesn't stop them from actually taking a screenshot. Telegram for Android is able to block screenshots (possible via any Android API). But iOS doesn’t have/offer an API where screenshots can be avoided (it informs you at least)

So when it says that a screenshot was taken, the other person is using an iOS device

Ps: talking about official clients Secret chat doesn’t disable screenshots, it just say you that someone did it What kinda client? You mean 3rd party apps? It does, but some clients/devices might not respect this setting/request.

Android on Huawei P20 for example blocks taking screenshots in secret chats. I mean that person showed me the pic that they screenshot .How is that possible? For example, yes. I do not know which clients would allow it tho, in case you're looking for that.

Most reliable way to take screenshots of a secret chat is to take a literal photo with a camera or second phone. Or iOS client As I said you can screenshot in secret chat. That’s like Snapchat you can screen but it say you did it Maybe that's how they took it using a second phone. Does every iOS permit this? Like, can any iPhone screenshots secret chats? But how? I tried to take screenshot in secret chat using my phone but it's says restricted . Than it would be undetected Yes, as in iOS it’s impossible for an app to disable screenshots. However, it would notify other side about that Which phone do you have ? It runs on ANDROID ONE(asus max pro m1) Telegram can block screenshot on android but on iPhone nothing can block it But the person who I was talking with was also using android .Now I am confused .

Not much. It can see your unique user ID, your public first name/last name, your language code (I think it's based on the IP location you were using when you registered your account, and your system language), and it can access your profile pictures (if your privacy settings allow it).

A bot can access your phone number only if you share it. Also remember that it may be able to see your messages in group chats (group chats where you're both in, of course) if the bot is admin there, or has the ability to receive all messages in groups (and not just `/commands`)"

Telegram is wasting time;0;jm6en5;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jm6en5/telegram_is_wasting_time/;9;"Telegram is waisting there time with these small updates like multiple pins. Are these important? 

With the given situation around the world and the competition, it would be really practical to add basic features like Group Calling in Video and audio. elevation in their stand out features like Channels to be more public and reachable like a official way to find channels or even bots.

Or a hard platform cleaning; because there are a lot of porn channels and most recent hit deepfake bots!

I think they are wasting there time and it is opportunity that they will miss out. 

Opinions??";2020-11-01 20:43:50;"Multiple pins are actually extremely useful, for example in groups for phone ROM development there are lots of pieces of important information that get easily lost in the chat. I'm sure this is true for many channels. Relatively simple improvements like this are what makes Telegram awesome. Constant smaller updates are better than occasional huge ones. 

There's a lot of ways to find channels and bots, just google Telegram channels directory. I think that group calls are in fact their priority right now (as it should be since they're so late to the video call bandwagon), the smaller and easier updates in-between are just filler There's probably some truth in this but personally I can say that a) I have plenty of options for group video calls right now, and whether Telegram adds them tomorrow or in three months, it doesn't matter to me. Nor will people I know use Telegram less because it doesn't have them (yet). YMMV.

Personally I'd much rather have them fix the problem with battery drain. You know that they have multiple teams so if they add multiple pins it doesn’t mean that there is no team working on group calling I mean channels and bots are their highlighted features, aren’t there should be a more official way to find them; I mean I don’t like to google and find some random link to telegram. how can it be sure? Could be a spam bot. I think you understand my point here I’m looking forward to video group calling. I think it should be ready by the end of the year? I second this. For me, it's the fact that font settings don't apply to the chat list!! Fonts here remain tiny for my eyes with no ability to change them at all!! Changes only apply to the messages themselves. How could they miss this? ""I don't like to google"" is a keyword here. 

They have an official directory of approved stuff. There are non-profits that maintain directories to support the project too."

"Image uploading is broken after the update, it now only shows ""compressed"" option only and it defaulted to ""send as file""";9;jlmtnv;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jlmtnv/image_uploading_is_broken_after_the_update_it_now/;15;;2020-10-31 20:53:46;"Where? In Telegram Desktop? It work like a charm. Once you select an image to sent, you'll be asked to select if compress the image (sending not as file) or not compressing it (sending as file). The ""send as image"" option disappeared and it sends ""as file"" now, please help. Any way to download the 2.4 version until this is fixed? Compressed vs uncompressed also doesn't do anything at all for images. Telegram will *always* compress images and *always* resize down to 1280 or whatever their dimensional limit is on images. If you throw up a 50KB .png that's 200x200 pixels it still gets recompressed as a jpeg regardless of settings. Even when the file format change yields a *larger* output file than the original, lossless quality png. 

I do not possess the vocabulary to adequately describe how utterly stupid Telegram's handling of images is. Even before the update, uploading them as a file attachment would then also break in-line rendering of the images, making people download the images manually and open them in other apps and it would break the album/grouping feature.

**edit:** [Video proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk9Riz11HLo) for those who think that the issue doesn't exist. Oh dear, oh dear! I actually had a similar bug where a photo was sent as a file whether I checked the box or left it unchecked. OP should try restarting the app and sending a few test files with the box unchecked, then checking it again. Worked for me. But that's not true. I'm using Telegram to upload photos from my phone shot in 3000x4000, and they are 100% the same after downloading from Telegram (check by hash sum) >uploading them as a file attachment would then also break in-line rendering of the images,

That's as it should be, if you choose to send them uncompressed then they should be treated like any other file attachment, don't forget many people are still paying for their data.

What you have shown in the video though is clearly a problem. [Here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk9Riz11HLo). Video of the issue in action. Telegram explicitly declares that the image will be sent without compression. Then in the upload preview the checkbox for compression is further manually toggled on and off to ensure no compression should be used and the image gets uploaded. Redownloaded afterwards and shock of all shocks, it's been resized from the original 1920x1280 to 1280x720 and with a lower jpeg quality preset, yielding a file size reduction from 539KB to 138KB. Feel free to continue telling me that it's not true, though. It's 100% true. Which client version are you using? On desktop (windows 10) the only way to upload an uncompressed image is as a file attachment. I've tested this repeatedly over and over with images of various file sizes and dimensions. Wait, it's simply a bug which broke sending ""as file"" by drag-and-drop. You can still upload image ""as file"" by using paperclip icon and Telegram will not compress anything on the fly. Just checked with the following steps:

1. Took a 8000x6000 (48 MP) photo with my phone
2. Uploaded it to Google Drive
3. Downloaded on my PC (I'm currently on Linux, however I can repeat the same on Windows)
4. Sent photo ""as file"" using paperclip icon with Telegram Desktop 2.4.5.
5. Renamed the file on my PC
6. Clicked on uploaded file on Telegram. Since the local file doesn't exist (it was renamed), it was re-downloaded from their servers.
7. Saved photo somewhere
8. Checked MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 checksums for both files. 

Result: Images sent ""as file"" are binary equal with originals and are not compressed by any means. 

The image I used: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CrzxqBeSXPL00a8S2gt1ANBB-LtqGd3m/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CrzxqBeSXPL00a8S2gt1ANBB-LtqGd3m/view) I appreciate the workaround, and that method will indeed restore the old pre-update ""send as file"" behavior, but doesn't address the way Telegram handles images, which unfortunately remains as silly as ever. The latest update changes the ui to imply that images (image files sent and treated as an image rather than a generic file upload) can now finally be transmitted uncompressed when it is not the case. The old behavior was somewhat ""pants on head"", but it was at least more clear about what it was doing and file uploads worked as intended, though in a manner that was far less convenient for everyone involved. 

My primary complaint is that the update makes the situation worse by not only addressing the issue of no support for uncompressed images, but the client actively lies to the user by having a UI with options for explicitly sending images uncompressed, but then ignoring the setting used. So, your complaint is only about the recent update? Then please pardon me, I thought you were implying that Telegram did always compress images.

Yeah, the recent update sucks, but the developer already knows it: [https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/8943](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/8943) I'm sure this bug is fixed in version 2.4.6: [https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/commit/39777f61492c0655ff77232d72862c9a05ba6835](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/commit/39777f61492c0655ff77232d72862c9a05ba6835) The primary issue right now is how it's even worse after the update, but I will say that I was quite unhappy with the state of image handling prior to the update as well due to how aggressively it compresses images without any minimum size threshold under which it would let them go 'untouched' so to speak. This led to couterproductive edge case scenarios where you might drag and drop a highly compressible image that's stored as a png for sharing with someone, such as an application screenshot or image with similarly ordered content only for Telegram to take what is already a tiny file, transcode it to jpeg and you'd end up with an image with a large amount of artifacting and a *larger* than before filesize. There are apparently no sanity checks in place to avoid this nor are there any sane lower bounds on triggering the logic for whether to attempt to shrink the file size of images.  
[Extreme edge case demo file](https://i.imgur.com/gkra4yz.png) if you want to test this in action. Uploading via the normal method and allowing telegram to ""helpfully"" (not so much) attempt to shrink it yields a, mildly put, less than desirable outcome.

Outside of uploading as a generic file it did indeed always compress images whenever you let it treat them as images. While you could upload as a ""file"" this also meant losing the tiled view gallery grouping of images and iirc not even the expanded slideshow/film reel type view would work, meaning you had to manually download each file and view them separately, which made sharing of images quite the annoying process. The near full screen slide show type view at least works now, which admittedly is a big step in the right direction. Other than fixing the drag and drop bug what remains now would be to also allow for more compact grouping into tiled thumbnails when using the grouped attachments mode. It's already generating small thumbnails for images uploaded via the normal file dialogue, so there's little reason to not also allow tiling them like normal images in album mode. In busy group chats or when someone sends more than just a handful of files and/or images the default presentation of grouped attachments can easily push an entire page or more worth of buffer off the screen."

Who created them? 
If you go to telegram.org/apps and stare carefully, you’ll find the one that ends in React, so you can trust it as it’s mentioned on the official Telegram webpage.  The other one is part of a contest (https://t.me/contests) organized by Telegram. The objective is a webpage that will replace the current one. 
And if it were not known by Telegram, it could still be used because each non-oficial Telegram app is “powered” by Telegram API. And yes, the official tg webpage is https://web.telegram.org, but as i said, it’s obsolete and will be replaced, that’s what the contest is for :) Thank you!!"

Hopefully, someone will read and consider to fix.

Pictures link: https://imgur.com/a/YUmJZ0C

# 1. Thumbnail of uploaded PDF files.

**Problem:**
- Telegram for macOS and iOS/iPadOS allow you to upload PDF files with a preview pictures (thumbnail-like) of the content of that PDF file. That preview picture is seeable on Telegram for Android, Telegram Web, Telegram React, Telegram Desktop, and the Telegram for macOS and iOS/iPadOS.
- But if you use Telegram for Android, Telegram Web, Telegram React, Telegram Desktop to upload those PDF files, you just see a dull icon.

**Request:**
- Allow all the Telegram client to upload PDF files with thumbnails the way Telegram for MacOS and Telegram for iOS/iPadOS do.

# 2. Edit files on Telegram for iOS/iPadOS

**Problem:**
- Telegram allows us to edit a posted PDF file (or any non-media files) by replacing the posted file with another one. But on the Telegram for iOS/iPadOS, if you edit the PDF file, you cannot get the document picker anymore. You will get the media picker instead.

**Request:**
- Return the document picker to Telegram for iOS/iPadOS when you edit posted file.

Makes telegram's live locations much better than whatsapp's How to get this update

The new version with these features is already available for all our Android users via Google Play or APK. If you're on iOS, you'll get the update as soon as either a) Apple finishes reviewing it OR b) you decide it's time to switch to Android. 👀

Now we'll get back to working on our costume. We're going as the Ghost of Group Chats Past: 256 members, no moderation tools and completely covered in green slime. See you on the other side! So is Telegram X on Android dead? With these improved animations it's getting closer to the feel of X but missing the thing that keeps me on X, which is the option to use a different set of emoji (being on Android using the system default Google emoji is nice)  instead of the iOS emoji in the regular telegram. I really want them to merge Telegram X with Telegram on android. Getting updates like this would be faster and in my opinion, the experience of using X is better. Have you noticed that now only one link in a group description is clickable? I don't understand why they did such thing Regarding pinned messages in a group, does anyone know why I can't pin a message that is around 2 months old?

Also a previously pinned message that becomes about 2 months old unpins itself. Is there a way to stop that behavior? Still waiting for secret groups and read receipts for groups (now it shows a double ✓ when someone has read a message, which is useless). Read receipts is a hard to implement feature for telegram since they support multiple devices at once. I heard that whatsapp is multiple devices support. Let’s see the way they handle it The new picture upload is terrible; when previously when you dragged and dropped a picture on desktop ""send image in a quick way"", right now what happens is it sends the picture along with the name, rather than just the picture as it still happens on mobile. That's horrendous and I don't understand why this got changed. And that’s because they build their iOS apps way before android and they design materials along with it. To be fair, the iPhone app is superior in terms of design and it's not like they're saying iPhones are bad. It's just that Apple takes ages to approve updates for some reason. >	OR b) you decide it’s time to switch to Android. 👀

Sure. Let me just pull a few hundred dollars out of my top hat and go buy a new Android phone. > a) Apple finishes reviewing it OR b) you decide it's time to switch to Android. 👀

I rather wait. Unlikely anytime soon as both are developed by two completely different developers on Android True, apple apps design is better in every app (I've had both OS) but they do dislike apple 😂 Luckily, iPhones hold their value pretty well in case you want to sell it to get an Android phone 😉

Just kidding, people should get whatever phone they like best. I love Telegram and I'm an Android user but I think they're going a bit overboard with all this anti-Apple thing. That at least gives me context to why it isn't yet. Let's hope those teams can merge internally as well. [deleted] Totally agreed, cooperation is better than fighting. Amazon cuts out a deal with Apple and they are chilling while Epic Telegram and other go against Apple. I think this will end pretty badly for Telegram since so far only Telegram pointed the finger at Apple and Apple will act arrogantly when they receive a chance and it will be bad fo this amazing platform 😕 Exactly. All because Durov is salty Apple takes more time to review app updates because a) there’s more apps in the App Store; b) App Store doesn’t have such $1000 scam apps, wonder why? c) developers prefer to update on iOS first as well. Therefore it takes like half a day longer for Apple to review updates, but he’s gotta go all out and even include “How to update?” in the blogpost, which is basically just “get an Android” propaganda. Smh. As far as I can see Apple really haven't changed their methods much (I think). It's just that Telegram is tired of putting up with them (which is also understandable).

But Pavel has to accept that people are going to use whatever phone they like best... they're not gonna switch to Android (or the other way around) because an app developer tells them to. I sure know I wouldn't switch to iPhones just because Pavel told me to... indeed that would probably lower my opinion about Telegram.

And I say this as a happy Pixel user who doesn't like iPhones, iOS or Apple products in general. Or maybe Durov is going a bit overboard with their childishly and propaganda instead. A-not really, due to Apple's stricter app guidelines and development expenses (the yearly development fee and the need for an Mac OS device to develop for it) the amount of apps in the App store is significantly lower 

B-saying it doesn't have/had isn't really true, it simply happens far less often than in other platforms (which is why you rarely ever hear about such apps)

C-While I do agree that durov's behavior when writing that was extremely immature and wrong I somewhat understand his point of view, sure, app reviews take time but considering Apple's high income they should in theory be able to afford hiring more reviewers to speed up their app reviewing process, being fast doesn't always have to necessarily mean comprising security.

[deleted] Yeah I think it's good that they point them out.

But I'm worried that they're actively trying to make iOS users feel like second-class citizens, or even slightly mocking them for using an iPhone. That's not how you convince people. Apple is way more private than Android. Agreed, Telegram is still growing compared to its own competitors, these fights will apple will only lower the usage of Telegram because I will never move back to Android just because I wanted to use Telegram. Its better but there are pretty convincing competitors. Its better if Telegram focus on their growth rather than fighting against the platform which has more than 1B active users. Also Epic Facebook are fighting for their revenue. And that’s the truth [deleted] Not disagreeing with you (to a degree), but can you explain your knowledge on what freedom I’m “limited” on using the iOS platform? [deleted] While yes, it is a limit, It isn’t one that impacts me, or most users. I can’t think of one app, that I can’t get now, that I would need to go through the trouble of side loading. In addition to compromising security for. [deleted] That’s not a limit, and we’re waiting for approval for the update, which every app has to go through. It’s a process, which google also has with the play store (maybe not as strict, but there’s a benefit for this process too). A computer is not the same situation. As far as I’m concerned your comment about limiting is just the same thing every android user says to make themselves feel better and like they know something. Typical response.

I love android, I used to be a developer on the platform. I am an apple user, and enjoy it just as much. People like what they like, they are both excellent platforms for consumer to use, and they both have their downfalls.

EDIT/TLDR: To each is own. But make sure you understand what you’re saying when you make comments. I buy iPhones because I just want my to “work.” If I needed the “freedom” for the sake of “can’t tell me what to do” then I’d get an Android and all the security and privacy issues that come along with it. 

I bet you don’t wear masks either because it’s your right. >	But jokes aside, would you buy a computer with Windows if you could only install things on the MS Store?

This is exactly why I don’t recommend a Windows machine to some users. 

A lot of them are tech illiterate. They’ve never used a classic PC (Mac, Linux or Windows). So for them an iPad with the advantages of being streamlined into a single App Store is awesome. They only need a web browser and a few social media apps. 

Use cases vary. [deleted] If you think a smartphone is in the same as a computer, this discussion ends here. You need to pickup a book.

Again, I am not loosing any “freedoms” pal, you’ve failed that argument miserably.

Hope you have a good day & weekend! It was fun. [deleted] I find Android users sure do try much harder than iOS users to make you feel inferior and explain to you why you’re “wrong.” [deleted] That’s fine. I actually develop for Android but when it comes to my phone, I just prefer iOS. 

All my streaming devices are Android TV or Fire TV, I am familiar with it and I do enjoy the freedom it allows. But for my phone I don’t need all of that and with the amount of time I spend on it I choose the privacy and security it offers versus Android. 

No hate against Android. I enjoy both but for different tasks. 

Same as my daily laptop- Windows10 but I develop and work in Linux. (the Linux projects I work on are tied into the Android apks) It’s not a fact! This is your opinion. Loosing my “freedoms” because I “cant” side load an app update that I’ll get in a few hours is not a limitation. You seriously need to educate yourself. 

Again, you have your opinion and that’s fine. It’s not a fact though. Like I said, both platforms are great. That’s it. You’re not selling anyone with your opinions lol [deleted] You completely lost me with your nonsense bro lol you have yet to prove you’re point as to how I’m loosing my freedom, and at this point I really don’t care to know. Like I said a few hours ago. Have a good day bud! It was fun. [deleted] We finally agree. :-)"

It is an insanely useful bot. install Telegram X from an APK I switched to @DeezerMusicBot and it seems actually better since the music files it sends don't have any annoying text attached.

Also the Spotify sourced the songs from Deezer as well, so in the end I don't think there is any difference. You need to find and download old version of Telegram (5.7.1 or lower) that does not have such restrictions. 

Alternatively you can search for ""patched"" or ""tweaked"" versions of Telegram, but this may be unsafe and risky if you don't know what it is. [deleted] I don't think any of existing Telegram clients that can access your current account which is linked to your location and the server can bypass this. So I don't know why they work on your PC. How is this blocked on Android but not on web or PC?, at least it is a workaround. [https://telegram.org/apps](https://telegram.org/apps) Did you try the one on F-Droid? Should be the same as the sideloaded one, but I heard the one on F-Droid has less Google bullshit, whatever *that* means. *This* sounds like whatever that means. Did it work on pc? Becuz till i remember it shouldn't be working anywhere web.telegram.org if you wanna use it, it is not blocked there, and it has a mobile interface. They don't provide APK for Telegram X, and development has stopped since May. At least I can use Telegram's PWA Yes me neither can't access from my pc or telegram web Check this out:   [https://imgur.com/s6huEeT](https://imgur.com/s6huEeT)

I downloaded Telegram from the Microsoft Store and it also works on this release of the app. And Telegram Web doesn't show this message at all, both on PC and mobile. Because on PC Telegram doesn't rely on any appstore such as Google Play or Apple app store. I already did that, no suitable apps. DMCA'ed accounts are flagged as such by the server, that also attaches to them the reason why they have been blocked, and also the target platform. So if Telegram-FOSS didn't remove these checks the app does on those flags, it's highly likely they are blocked there too Although it's FOSS, it still has that notice, not bypassable. It will work on PC, both web and app, but not the one from the Microsoft Store (I think). **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

Also note that Telegram needs to be installed for each user. My wife has her own Windows account, and therefore she needs her own Telegram. She never updates hers, and when I update mine, it doesn't affect hers at all. At least that way it keeps things separate.

I don't know if I'm just dumb or something but on my Android device I have yet to figure out how to get the dark mode to activate when I set the system theme to being dark. Though I've been a Telegram user for years, their ""auto dark mode"" seems like a joke and I literally always have to manually make the switch between light and dark themes. 

Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks!";2020-10-30 08:14:31;"Do you have the option ""System default"" on? (Settings > Chat Settings > Auto-Night Mode (press the option, not the switch) > System default) 

If you do, then make sure the theme you have is a lighted one (the one outside). Then, when you switch on or off the dark mode on your device Telegram will adapt to it. Jesus, I never would've guessed that there isn't just an on/off toggle to that option. Thank you so much! Your welcome! And believe me, that's kind of concern. I thought one day that there are people that may even never know there's an extra setting there.

You might have accidentally tapped on voice message icon Did you tap to record a voice message and then closed the app to the background? This might be the reason; your system detected that the app was still trying to record your message. Another scenario would be when you're listening to a voice message and you keep your phone to your ear, Telegram will start recording your voice message reply automatically (you can deactivate that in the settings). [deleted] Telegram doesnt record you without you wanting it. Maybe you used the microphone or something like that. The telegram app is open source so it would be stupid if they have implemented a function like that Permission logging feature should exist and can be accessed from the Settings app (on an un-skinned Android 10 at least) under Privacy. But you cannot normally get copies of the recording(s) The notification details said it was background use. I know why I'm asking, but it seems redditors are ready to assume I'm just dumb. Except the Google app IS recording everything. How else would it be able to record you saying ""Ok Google"" before it detects you saying it? (you can access recordings of all your voice activations through Google Takeout). Now it doesn't KEEP the recordings, discarding everything after it doesn't detect you saying saying ""Hey Google"" in the chunk. However, it very much is recording, and sometimes sounds that happened before you call the voice assistant get recorded, and sometimes it has false positives, activating and saving audio, even though you didn't want to. You mean it's actively listening for any sounds resembling things like 'Ok Google' but it's not recording it? Do you mean that they do not store the audio feed from your mic after their softwares (either locally or remotely) process those to identify the hotword(s) in order to respond to those? So, what is Telegram waiting for me to say? I'm concerned about this. I use Telegram every day, so I should see this notification everyday yet I don't. It just showed up last night. Shouldn't it alpear every time I send a voice/video message?

After opening the notification details, it said this was a background usage. So, I'm not buying the ""maybe you tapped your recording button by accident"" comments. I know why I post, and its not for random redditors to assume I'm wrong. Telegram doesn’t record any of your sound in the background. Some phone’s might incorrectly detect background usage, info about that is in the Telegram FAQ > it seems redditors are ready to assume I'm just dumb

I don't think it's that anyone thinks you're dumb, I think it's that you didn't share much information, so people have to assume your level of knowledge on the subject. Storing that amount of voice data would be astronomically stupid. Sending 24/7 recordings to their servers from mics from every person with a phone would, and I'm not exaggerating, blow up the internet; or, at the very least, their server's networks and the ISP they're connected to. Hell, even doing on-the-fly detection of conversations is extremely stupid, as it would *destroy* your battery life.

Having set up a system like this for my own personal voice assistant: yes, it does send the mic input constantly through the app, but it's ejected just as quickly as it arrives. The moment it thinks it hears ""Ok google"" (the hotword) it starts streaming the remaining query up to Google's servers for processing and to get the reply. By default, those are stored for a few months, but Google lets you prevent these being stored on their servers at all with a setting. This is a more useful comment. Thanks. You are welcome"

Groups are group chats - anyone can talk, unless specifically restricted by the owner or admins, you can't hide the list of people though you can hide who the admins are.

Channels are like one-way communication - you and any admins you set can post anonymously or sign the posts, the rest can only read them and comment, if you have enabled that function. Nobody can see the list of people in the channel except for the channel creator and admins. Not sure if I get your question, but channels already default to those settings. Only admins can send messages, and regular members can't see the full list of members. Thanks bro"
Telegram Call Quality vs WhatsApp / Other Messengers;0;jjocuk;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jjocuk/telegram_call_quality_vs_whatsapp_other_messengers/;6;"Has anyone noticed if Telegram is better for voice calls than WhatsApp or other free messengers?

If so does anyone know technical differences in the various Apps with regards to audio calls?";2020-10-28 17:05:36;"Telegram calls for me are the worse out of any of the popular messenger. Google duo is the best in both audio and video calls, by far. As much I use Telegram, for calls I still prefer FaceTime Audio or video. Audio call quality used to be a lot better. I've had some good video calls on the platform since the feature launched but it might have already gone downhill. I tested voice call quality on Signal, Telegram, Duo and Viber. 
Signal and Telegram have the best audio quality if the connection is stable. For example if you talk over each other on Signal, the conversation is still understandable while on Duo you barely understand the other side. Also, for me Duo tends to lose parts of words on good connection while that's never the case with Signal. Some words definitely sound muffled on Duo. Signal is crystal clear. 
However, Duo is usable when the connection is bad while with Signal you can't even make a call. Telegram is also bad when the connection is bad.  
Viber had the worst audio quality in my tests (voice sounded least realistic) but I haven't tested it when the reception is bad so I don't know how robust it is. 
So if you want the most realistic voice and intend to call in areas where the coverage is good, try Signal or Telegram. They use the same audio codec I think. Use Duo if the reception is bad or you're on 2G. Did you Test Telegram with the Peer to Peer setting turned on or off? It was on. I didnt change it."

Can Telegram cause long distance charges on my phone plan?;1;jjj366;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jjj366/can_telegram_cause_long_distance_charges_on_my/;5;I think I know the answer which is no but I just want to be sure. So if I'm at home on wifi and use telegram to make or receive a call from Canada to the US will there be any long distance fees or any effect on my phone plan at all?;2020-10-28 10:00:12;Nope. Telegram calls are entirely IP-based. No call on telegram ever incurs charges because you aren’t making a call, you’re using data. Only cost associate could be the cost of the data, which on WiFi is probably zero. It works in pretty much the same way as WhatsApp. You'll never incur monetary charges as it only operates through data, not your cell phone's minutes. So if your on WiFi and you proceed with a long distance call, it won't use up your phone's data either as it will instead be running through your WiFi. Thank you for the quick response. Thank you. I appreciate the quick response.
Automatic Account Deletion;0;jjj188;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jjj188/automatic_account_deletion/;4;[deleted];2020-10-28 09:55:00;"You have to open one of the apps in which your account is logged in at least once every X months, otherwise your account will be deleted. I interpret this ""you have to log in"" as to at least open the app and show the chat list.

If an account gets deleted it will show to the other chat party as ""deleted account"", but the chat would not be deleted [deleted] I think you have to open one of the apps and go online at least every X months otherwise your account gets deleted, I don't think it's sufficient to have the app installed without opening it [deleted] If you are only logged in to the app on your phone and you don't open the app for a month (and the account canceling policy is set to a month) I think your account would be deleted.

What I can tell you is to log in with your Telegram account to another app (for example Telegram desktop on your computer) so if you lose your phone you can revoke the access to your account on the phone app using your pc while still being able to log in into your account using the computer.

Tip number 2 is going immediately to your cellphone provider to get your lost SIM card deactivated and get a new one if you lose your phone as your phone number can be used as a phisical verification form to access your Telegram account. To protect even more your account you can set a password to log in to Telegram from new devices, but be careful not to lose this password!

Should you turn off the permission that normal users can add members?;7;jj8wou;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jj8wou/should_you_turn_off_the_permission_that_normal/;5;"Hello!  
I wondered, if you should turn off the option that normal group members can add their friends. Some people may abuse this feature to add hundreds of people into a group. Those added people will then see a ""report"" message. If they click on the report button, does the group itself get reported in this case or does this start a report against the user who added the person? 

Some people say you should turn this off, because it could lead to a deletion of a group and some people say that in the case members are added against their will by a normal user and these members click on report the report will go against the person who added the other person. 

The German support of Telegram couldn't help me with that question, too, which is why I'm asking here. Maybe someone of you figured this out.";2020-10-27 23:14:30;"Yes,turn it off,it's called quality control I think it's best to turn it off because you never know if someone adds a user who might start spamming or just trolling. While it's easy to just ban that guy and delete his messages, it's best to keep control in the hands of group admins. If they need someone invited, they can ask and ping the admin to do so. I recommend it.  If you want to let members invite other people turn on the link and tell people in the group what the link is.

That way, people entering the chat took action to join and don't have a ""report and leave"" button, and if the link ends up in places you don't want you can always kill it and roll a new one.

I run a number of groups and I've learned through pain that you never want to add anyone directly to groups.  Send them a link. To Stop spammers from inviting more spammers to your group, you better turn it off I leave it turned on for friend groups, because it's way more comfortable and I know almost all of them. Besides, I'm a good resourceful mod and I can deal with spam waves.

However, I turn it off for big groups, especially when they're controversial or NSFW, because if someone takes offense, or wants to spam and scam people (common in crypto / finance groups), they will come in and you'll never know who they are and it'll be hard unless you're lucky to find the logs for when they entered.

There's a group I have that was public and it was terrible spam. I removed its public link and made a channel with its name, and published the invite link there. I also removed adding because people added bots to spam. All in all it was a good choice. I have a strong enough influx of people.

However, I have a medium group, around 120 people, where I have add members enabled, but it's a very friendly group and I also have 10 admins. I haven't had trouble during the year it's been active. (The biggest trouble was someone insulting someone else and getting banned lmao)"

It's not an issue. Each secret chat is like a tunnel between two devices of the two intended accounts. You can have more than one tunnel between two devices though. It might be because one is their phone and one is their computer. A secret chat is encrypted to 2 devices. So if you want a secret chat with someone and they are on two or three devices it would be one per device. Unless they only used one for secret chats.

Others are saying that you could create an additional secret chat even with just 2 devices. If you create a secret chat it makes a new one. That's just how they work. Thanks for the info!! Thanks for the info!! Yeah that makes sense. Thanks for the info!!"

(Plus, I never understood how people have that demanding attitude that they \_should\_ be able/allowed to delete things from someone else's phone etc. - but i guess it has already been like that with email;  Someguy calling customer support: ""I sent them the wrong email, can you delete it?"" - Me: ""No?"" - Someguy: ""WHY NOT, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE!!!!!"") yup, it works regardless Even if you forgot to check ""delete on both sides"" ...

"Is there a way to stop the desktop client from showing ""last seen recently"" to the other person when switching windows?";0;jicf8u;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jicf8u/is_there_a_way_to_stop_the_desktop_client_from/;4;"I like to use the desktop client of telegram as this allows me to use the keyboard however I dislike the fact that when I switch windows it shows ""last seen recently"" fairly quickly. Actually it's the person I'm chatting with that dislikes it as it gives them the impression that I am not paying attention to them or I am otherwise busy, which I am not, I simply wish to make use of the time that they are thinking and typing out their reply. I have spoken to them about this but regretfully my explanation is insufficient.

At the moment the only way I can prevent telegram from telling the other person that I am switching windows is to also open telegram on my phone, which helps kill it's battery. Any suggestion would be welcome, even third party programs that would  switch to telegram for a nano second and back or a memory hack that makes the telegram client think it has focus would be appreciated.";2020-10-26 13:55:01;"maybe use telegram web instead of desktop client and switch to a different tab. The only way to solve it, would be making a userbot that will keep your account online all the time.

But honestly, it would be just better if the other person just understood how Telegram works. And even better if they would just get over the fact that chatting is not everything people do in their free time and it doesn't mean anything wrong.

However, as a partial solution, add them to exceptions in ""Last Seen"", inside Privacy and Security tab. They will see you online more often and also the exact time. Mind the fact that friend of yours also needs to do it. Open the same chat on your phone and keep it open. I will give this a try but usually I switch out to a game instead of just a browser tab. I hope the web client behaves differently. Thanks for the suggestion."

This is the react version mentioned in another reply) try changing your DNS use a proxy what about link mentioned here? https://github.com/zhukov/webogram/issues/1974 This is the official web version by the way Good bot For the one you made, can I suggest to put a link to the source code on the homepage?

Zhukov is Telegram developer so his webogram is the same as official one (it's the same thing really). However it's not maintained anymore.

Why the hell the Upload Speed is so slow?;0;jhs49k;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jhs49k/why_the_hell_the_upload_speed_is_so_slow/;7;At least put some CDN's to improve this or something, can't believe in 2020 TG have this limited speed.;2020-10-25 14:49:54;"I believe it's partially in part due to their allowable file sizes. They slow down upload so you don't hog all the bandwidth or upload tons of stuff to their servers unless you really really have to. Speed is limited by Telegram clients for the already mentioned here reasons. There's a project on github that allows you to upload files bypassing this limit. The author reached ~240 Mbps using it.

I have about 10 Mbps for uploading via Android official app right now, but maybe more than that, my VPN has a 10 Mbps limit. Can't check without VPN because Telegram almost doesn't work at all without it due to the government's attempts to suppress the protests. Do you mind if you tell us your upload speed uploading to telegram and your raw upload speed?

&#x200B;

Mine is 200-300Kbps uploading files to telegram and 8Mbps raw upload speed. Link to the GitHub project? I get about the same on a 15Mbps upload.

My guess comes from being a developer. I'd do the exact same thing. Allow big files, make uploads slow. That way, only people who really need it use it and you don't shell out thousands in bandwidth to asshats who abuse the system. https://github.com/SlavikMIPT/tgcloud I agree. It wasn't this slow before, but when I realized that there was basically ""no storage limit"" I was being an asshat and abused the system, then it suddenly became slow.

&#x200B;

The upload file size limit to telegram is 2GBs and if you abused the system that would take approx. 15 hours to upload 2GB file...

&#x200B;

This maybe off topic but, if people want storage just go for google drive it just cost less than a dollar or if people don't want to pay just use multicloud."
Is it possible to message new people on mobile without providing access to contacts?;2;jhs18y;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/57bm7x7ba8v51.jpg;4;;2020-10-25 14:42:16;"I'm not sure why Telegram even wants access to my contacts.

That's what my original message is about - not sure how to use the app without handing over my social graph.  


Worth noting - Telegram works just fine on desktop. No requests for a book of contacts. I signed up on Telegram's Linux distro and then downloaded the app to my phone. They allowed me to see the rooms that I'm also using on my desktop. Absurd but it works.

But the real solution is clear - just use Signal. They actually respect privacy."
Hidden user IDs, apparently;1;jhosl8;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jhosl8/hidden_user_ids_apparently/;9;"In the process of administering some groups I have run across users with ""blank"" display names, which when in combination with no @username, means it's difficult to kick or ban them. (I can do it by replying to a message though)

Then there are users that seem to not only have no visible @username, but their actual numeric User ID is not ascertainable either. For example, even if I forward a message from them to @UserInfoBot, it cannot find their User ID.

How do we deal with such users? These things seem like serious Telegram bugs to me. Some accounts like this are spoofing popular bots and so on.";2020-10-25 09:26:24;"This is a feature, not a bug: [https://telegram.org/blog/unsend-privacy-emoji#anonymous-forwarding](https://telegram.org/blog/unsend-privacy-emoji#anonymous-forwarding)

If you turn ""anonymous forwards"" on, your user id will be removed on any forwarded message. This doesn't hide your ID completely though which may still be accessible when chatting directly.

Dealing with such people in groups is easy: either reply to their message (I do it to restrict specific users) or simply delete message with ban (or even report), as usual. Get Plus Messenger or just a Userbot, which will show u the user id in their profile or per command.

I never saw one without id. This is impossible. Show me... 🤔 Thanks for your reply.

The account in question at the moment hasn't sent any recent messages but is ""lurking"" in a group impersonating a popular group bot. (Which also happens to be in the same group)

So there is no message to act upon at the present time.

(Update: I used the Plus Messenger client to get the user ID so I could ban the user. Thanks for all your suggestions) Show you what?

I certainly cannot show you the @username or User ID, because I cannot obtain them.

I heard that one of the 3rd-party clients had such a feature, I may try that. I could join your group and will get the id. Nice try. :-D

Not interested in other people finding the IDs, *I* want to learn how to do this.

This is not the first time I have tried using @UserInfoBot to find a user ID and it could not be found.

Theoretically I could also use a group bot to find a user ID as well but I'd rather not have that process printed for all to see via in-group commands, as this appears to be a malicious account.

There is obviously some ""loophole"" here. This bot doesn't work since you can disable message forwarding 

Adding rose in the group or getting third party client would be the way to do.

Don't understand why printing id would be bad. Probably your very new to telegram haha... Since everyone can get the id with just a custom client which is even supported from tg. Nor the id is anything privacy related. I use the FOSS client for Android specifically for privacy reasons.

Unless there is a very important reason, I would rather not install these other clients, especially from organizations I do not know.

But in this case I may temporarily install this client on an isolated device or emulator because of this problematic user.

Does the Plus Messenger show you the message ID of any user regardless of whether you have opened a chat with them? Dude, you are using telegram thisnisnt privatr by design... Hahahah omfg. I'm out bye."

New to Telegram, but have a large Facebook audience that is very interested in me creating a channel. Seeking advice.;50;jhi064;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jhi064/new_to_telegram_but_have_a_large_facebook/;13;"Hello,

  
I have a large and very active Quotes page and group on Facebook for a popular author.  


I recently made a post asking if there is any interest in starting a telegram channel, and had an overwhelmingly positive response. Hundreds of comments practically begging for it.   


I'm new to telegram, and have only been familiarizing myself with it in the last few days. I'm very impressed, but I'm also very green.   


I have the ability to create a large channel very quickly with my facebook audience, and I'd like to avoid any rookie mistakes when running a channel, if possible. What bots should I run, what basic rules should i set, etc.   


I'm here seeking advice and tips, and I really appreciate any you have to offer!";2020-10-25 01:20:19;"I think with channels you can't do much wrong. Groups are hard because you need to fight against spam / advertisment / etc ... I'd recommend making a public channel with a memorable invite link. then making a pinned post in the channel with a link to all your other socials (optional: a way to contact you on Telegram - depends if you want ppl to be able to message you on TG, it can get very annoying).

I'd also look into using IFTTT and seeing if you can set it up to automatically post a FB post in the TG channel, so it's all automated. be sure to test in a private channel separate from your main one, so it doesn't mess with anything on the main one. Recommendations for group and channel management.

Check out this chat with thousands of people. You can use the search function to find bots that do anything. Otherwise, ask in the chat.

@BotListChat

You can also use their bot which is an index of bots.

For groups, I recommend the captcha bot. Also the banhammer bot or the bot called Rose. They allow you to manage your groups very easily and, if you ever make more than one, to have a list of banned people to be banned there too. You can also establish a warn system to ban after 2 or 3 warnings and send a message with the reason for the ban.

For the channel, I recommend controller bot, and maybe others that I'm not aware of, that allow you to add reaction emojis and other things.

If you contact me on Telegram, I run many chats and am a bot builder. My nickname is @bestulo. I can give you some advice and could also work for you as a power mod. Good luck and ask any questions. A few suggestions and features.

1- put the telegram link of your channel at the end of every post, this way if someone copies your content to share somewhere, the content always has the reference to your channel (e.g. [t.me/my\_awesome\_channel](https://t.me/my_awesome_channel)) and it's kind of a standard for telegram channels.

2- Telegram has configurable polls, bold or italic or monospace font, scheduled posts, and more. Use them to your advantage.

3- Telegram also has albums where you can send up to 10 photos in a single post.

4- You can see some interesting stats if your channel is bigger than a certain size.

5- use the link feature to avoid putting large URLs in your posts; it's not professional.

6- You can connect a telegram group to your channel where people can discuss the posts and it also adds a 'comments' feature to your channel, which means people can comment on the posts. But be careful, managing a telegram group is actually can be tricky but the telegram has some good features for that too.

7- don't forget there are so many different types of media in telegram: audio, voice message, video message, photo, file(can be anything), video, sticker, animated sticker, gif, location, live location, contact card, etc. Each one has different features and look. Almost everything can have a caption, the only exceptions I can think of are stickers and video messages. The channel can have multiple profile photos and each one can be a squared photo or a squared gif. (for geeks: the gif type in telegram is not actually the gif photo format, it is the silent mp4 video format which its video has been encoded with AVC)

I am sure there is more to this. If I remember anything I will add it here. might not apply to your desire for this but if you do round videos you automatically generate a [telesco.pe](https://telesco.pe) url Channels are a very good idea, I'd just personally stay clear of groups. With more than a small group of people it just decends into anarchy IMO. I haven't followed many larger groups but I found about this today:
https://smartphones.gadgethacks.com/how-to/slow-down-telegram-group-chats-catch-up-follow-along-0254575/

The admin can add a limit of a waiting period reducing spam and hopefully incentivizing better written messages Thank you! IFTTT? 🤔 Thank you very much! > optional: a way to contact you on Telegram

You can also put that in the channel bio, by the way, as well as a quick description. I'd also recommend a hashtag system, like #inspirational, #funny, etc. Just so people can navigate easier. idk how to describe it lol, but i use it to automate stuff. it’s a website and app called IF This Then That Oh ok haha, thanks!"

Something is amiss here.  I've been brigaded on TG and ""restricted"" twice, and the behavior is exactly like they described (you cannot initiate contact with strangers or add strangers to chat groups).  

Since I was a chat moderator for a dozen groups this was very inconvenient, but not fatal.

I was still able to participate fully in all chat groups I was a member of, and even join new groups and channels.  

But if a member of one of my groups asked me to contact them to help with a problem over private message, I had to ask them to reach out to me instead.  And I could not just add them to another chat if they asked, I had to set up a join link or promote someone else to moderator to do it.

Not being able to post at all isn't normal ""restricted"".  Either I am misunderstanding the issue you have, or their volunteer support team is. He did not block you in his chat he reported you to the telegram. Such an action puts you on their warning list and blocks you from any activity for a limited time.
You can check with @SpamBot I said when will the price be $400? The price was going sideways. It upsetted the admin so he muted me. apparently I posted in the wrong Telegram group. Apparently theirs a group just for price discussion. It was so trivial and I had no idea they had a channel dedicated to price talk. So they muted me for 24 hours and somehow muted every single group which is completely unrelated to the group I got muted in. I lost my ability to post a message in the public servers telegram chat. I was told by a mod I was muted because they didn't like my joke. But what's interesting I just noticed I can post in some servers. Theirs like 4 I'm muted in. Does this mean those 4 servers are owned by the same person? So I annoy someone with a joke he doesn't like and he can put me on Telegrams warning list? Now I'm a known trouble maker in the system for telling a joke? He reported me and in 4 mins Telegram made their decision to ban me from speaking in multiple channels? 

I messaged an admin he said they muted me. 

I noticed several severs unrelated I can't leave messages in I'm muted. But on some servers I can. Does this mean the servers I can't speak in are owned by the same person? Yeah that guys life just sucks if he’s taking something so trivial and meaningless and asserting such control over it. He’s got a little dick too. I’ve seen it. It probably means you have been restricted from posting in those 4.  If they are related they might be owned by the same person. 

 It's more likely they use a common bot to do their permissions so they can just feed it a username and restricts then automatically lifts the ban at a set time on all their chats. I do not know for sure but if the bot I gave in the previous comment does not recognize you I am probably wrong and you are right. That is, the groups belong to the same owner"

If you can't access the sms code and/or it's been longer than 6 months that account is gone and is not recoverable. Where is the US SIM card? With you in Europe? Or in US? Suggest you FedEx the SIM to a friend in the US and let them receive the SMS code and send it to you to activate on your Portuguese phone. I can't receive any US messages with my US Sim card If there is a way, idk now to do it With me Then you need to figure out why that is the way it is. You can't recover your TG account without receiving that code. There is simply no way to do it. If there was, that would make the security of TG pointless. So spend the $20 or $30 and mail it home to a friend. Problem solved.  (Even less money if you trust the national postal services, which are usually reliable, if slower) That means, I'm going to lose my account in five months. Not if you figure out why it doesn't work. Have you tried moving that # to Google voice? Assuming you can still control that #, that would be an easy way to fix it. Wait, what? How can I do that? Google is your friend.

There's a tricky way to achieve what you're trying to do: search from outside and from within your archive returns different results (at least on the Android app), Telegram will look for your query in your unarchived or archived chats based on where you're using the search. So if you want to exclude a channel from the results, simply archive it. If the ducks channels all already archived, you either unarchive the chats you're interested in, or, uh, give up All right, I'll give it a shot. Thanks.

There are no rules for telegram groups. Group admins can do whatever they please within their groups.

Forever. Until deleted by group admins or yourself.

> How long will the group itself last?

Forever, again until deleted.

> I heard that it would delete if unused for 6 months.

Telegram ACCOUNTS get deleted after 6 months of inactivity (ie not logging in). This is the default value and can be changed to 1, 3, 6 or 12 months.

> I am planning to use telegram groups for storing some 50 GB of data, it seems like a good option for doing it. But if data is going to be deleted there is no point of doing it. So, asking in a telegram group of reddit.com. Hope I get help.

You can do that in chunks of 2 GB files. That'd work and there are entire networks of channels that upload movies. It will be deleted if you don't log into your telegram account for 6 months. But I think you can change those 6 months to 12 months in the settings. To piggyback off your comment - OP doesn't need to make a group to store files, if they just want to share them with a group of people. They could make a private channel and invite anyone who needs access. This way the files won't get lost amid people messaging. Also, making it private means that copyrighted content won't be found by the copyright holders. Precisely, good addition. Thanks"
Channels not showing on Telegram Web;3;jgemb4;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jgemb4/channels_not_showing_on_telegram_web/;6;"Hello all! I have noticed that since yesterday, when I access Telegram Web, my channels are not showing, only groups and private conversations are listed. The channels appear normally on my mobile app.

I have tried logging out from Telegram Web, clearing cookies from browser, but nothing works.

Has anyone noticed the same behavior?";2020-10-23 05:53:00;Telegram Web seems not to be actively mainained any longer and using native apps is recommended. If you still want a web version, use [https://evgeny-nadymov.github.io/telegram-react/](https://evgeny-nadymov.github.io/telegram-react/) (it is mentioned on [https://telegram.org/apps](https://telegram.org/apps) and is considered the official). The latter, however, doesn't work on mobile devices. Didn’t know that, thanks for the heads up. Do you know if the Linux native app is any good? I’m a Linux user, and I have experience with the Linux apps being the ones that receive less attention on the development. Telegram Desktop ([https://desktop.telegram.org](https://desktop.telegram.org/)) is a multiplatform app for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Been using it for years and despite sometimes there might be some Linux-specific bugs, the app overall is awesome. And my personal experience with it is 99% the same on Windows and Linux. So, I have installed the Desktop version for Linux, but the problem persists. I still can't see my channels. Sometimes they show for a while, but after a couple of hours they stop showing. I have tried logging on my account on Windows 10 too, with the same result. Has anyone been having the same problem? That's really weird, didn't ever encounter this bug In case anyone enconters this problem, I solved it by uninstalling the app from my phone and installing again. It looks like it was a problem in the mobile app, and reinstalling it solved the issue.

Your question about which groups to join is too general. You can search for groups related to your interests, and they'll have a link that looks like https://telegram.me/groupslink. Clicking on it will join the group via the web or desktop client (I strongly recommend Desktop).

I'm not sure what you mean by a drop. Where did you hear about it? Telegram is basically just like WhatsApp, it's not ""real social media"" like facebook, instagram or twitter.

But you can join groups/channels that interest you by searching them up through the search icon in the top right of the app. And these really depends on what you are interested In.

Try going through r/telegramgroups
There you can find groups that might interest you. Where do you think you are? r/TelegramGroups?"

\- telegram devs constantly change their location based on the rights enforced in the country, they moved away from russia because russia wanted the userdata, atleast this is how the story is told, not sure if this is true

\- based on statements, the data is save on the telegram servers is save, which would make it much more secure than whatsapp becausew of the metadata they steal, but signal and others are still better

\- to your last point: you need your real number for signing up, but after this you can give yourself a unique username and hide your number

\- in my opinion it is the most feature rich messenger, which i think is more importan, because if someone wants to hack you he can anyway, so you should try it out I too didn't like giving my phone number, but it's purely to prevent random spam and bullshit. Once you have logged in with a number, set a username, email address and password, and after that you can use the number for login purposes only at new locations, long after you've ditched the phone number.

If you're logged in to telegram when it would try to send you an SMS or call for verification, then it will instead send the verification details to you on telegram, so you never need an active number past that first step, as long as you keep something signed in to telegram. As safe as much as you trust them >telegram devs constantly change their location based on the rights enforced in the country, they moved away from russia because russia wanted the userdata, atleast this is how the story is told, not sure if this is true

That's not quite true. The main part of the team was and continues to be in Dubai, they do not move anywhere all the time. Some employees are in other countries. For example, the former voip dev did not move anywhere at all and lived and worked from Saint Petersburg. 

Durov's move from Russia is not related to Telegram, but to VKontakte. Developing Telegram was just the result of these situation, according to Durov."

[Telegram FOSS](https://github.com/Telegram-FOSS-Team/Telegram-FOSS) **Changes:**

*Replacement of non-FOSS, untrustworthy or suspicious binaries or source code:*

* Do location sharing with OpenStreetMap(osmdroid) instead of Google Maps
* Use Twemoji emoji set instead of Apple's emoji
* Google Play Services GCM replaced with Telegram's push service
*Has to show a notification on Oreo+, ask Google*
* **SECURITY:** Old BoringSSL prebuilts are replaced with the newest upstream source code built at compile time
* **SECURITY:** Old FFmpeg prebuilts are replaced with the newest upstream source code built at compile time

*Removal of non-FOSS, untrustworthy or suspicious binaries or source code and their functionality:*

* Google Vision face detection and barcode scanning (Passport)
* Google Wallet and Android Pay integration
* Google Voice integration
* HockeyApp crash reporting and self-updates
* Google SMS retrieval. *You have to type the code manually*

*Other:*

* Allow to set a proxy before login
* Added the ability to parse locations from intents containing a geo:<lat>,<lon>,<zoom> string
* Force static map previews from Telegram Yes, but, unlike the FOSS version, it uses Google/Hockeyapp stuff for notifications, crash reports, analytics, maps, etc. My bad , I misunderstood the question , what you need is a different app package name so it can be installed on the system independently side by side. But that's the solution. Instead of trying to install FOSS version beside the original, install the original but the beta, which has different package name."

You say that you do not have any contacts in your Google account, but are there also no phone numbers in your local contacts on your phone? You say that some people have been notified of you joining Telegram, so there must have been these numbers in your contacts. These people now have a message history with you which you can't undo afaik. (You can delete a whole chat and also have it deleted on the other party's account, I don't know if this will prevent them from contacting you again, though) Was the person who messaged you also notified? I do have them on Microsoft account. The person who messaged me was notified, yes. There is also at least another one who was notified as well. Having a chat history - so THAT is what caused it... I've had a few chats that I've never deleted, and their phone number are now owned by new people. I always wondered why I can't stop seeing their phone numbers (and by extension, can't stop them from seeing mine). 

That kinda sucks - I wish I can prevent this from happening. Ok, so your question was: ""How is this possible?"" - This is your answer. You granted Telegram access to your contacts and it uploaded them to their servers to check who of them also uses Telegram and to notify those people about you. It doesn't matter on which account the contacts are, if they are sync'ed to your phone, they're in the contacts you granted Telegram access to.

If you do not want this to happen, you have to deny Telegram access to your contacts (which you already did). This however comes too late for the contacts that already have been uploaded and notified. Oh, I see, thank you. So a couple of more questions. 
What if someone who already had Telegram didn't receive the notification? Will they still be able to see my number? And what if someone who was in my contact list joins Telegram now? if they didn’t receive a notification, that means they’re not a contact/don’t have your number saved, so they won’t be able to see your number. 

if someone joins TG, then if they’re not in your contacts, they won’t see your account because you have gone by phone numbers set to my contacts - and you have no contacts. if you did have them in your contacts, then you’d get a notification they joined TG."

Does Telegram have access to my messages;30;jfvrjz;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jfvrjz/does_telegram_have_access_to_my_messages/;48;The distributed network of servers makes it hard for governments to request the encryption keys, but does Telegram have internal access to messages stored in the cloud?;2020-10-22 11:25:33;"In theory yes, unless you used a secret chat

Not sure how much of a pita it would actually be for someone at telegram to actually gain access to a specific users messages in practice though Obviously yes, unless you are using secret chats & are making sure both sides have the same fingerprint The short answer is ""yes""

The owner of a computer system generally has access to all of the data stored on it - this goes for any type of system. Email, Messaging, Cloud Storage, etc.  Unless they are specifically using user-supplied encryption keys with client-side encryption (Such as iCloud does, if I recall correctly) so that the data is stored on their servers encrypted with a key they do not have access to. Yes. All the talk about keys being kept somewhere other than the data is pretty much just marketing talk. Telegram hold the keys so they can read any and all messages at any time, as well as hand them out to anyone they decide to. Note, I am not saying they have done that or that they currently do that or even that they intend to do that. Just that the technical ability is there and it is very easy to use.
For the provider not to be able to read your messages you need end-to-end-encryption (E2EE). Telegram’s “secret chats” are E2EE, but of course you lose some functionality (no backups, no multi-device). Other apps such as Signal are always E2EE. General consensus says the answer is “YESSSS” Short answer: **YES**

(exception for secret chats)

The system is not end-to-end-encrypted (E2EE), therefore stored at their server with some key. You can trust telegram, but in the end it is possible and they do have access.

Solutions that have E2EE where you and only you own the data:

* Signal
* Elemento.io / Matrix

You'll face the challenges of end-to-end-encryption:

* You have to manage the keys backups yourself
* You lose your own password you loose everything It does. Telegram is known to be pretty bad for planing terrorist attacks as authorities keep showing up exactly at the right time at the right place. Having the access to your msgs is the whole point of telegram But even without a secret chat the government could access my messages right? Because there's no encryption unless it's a secret chat Well... there were cases in the past where employees of internet companies did that. Read specific messages. Look at nudes etc. Listen to the fox *ACKTHUALLY,* [iCloud is not a zero-knowledge service.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_backup_services#Comparison)

Let alone that it is a closed-source model. And I wouldn't put it past a company like Apple not having backdoors in it either. This is not a marketing talk at all. This is actually pretty important legally. No single subpoena can make them hand out both the keys and the encrypted data. > Yes. All the talk about keys being kept somewhere other than the data is pretty much just marketing talk

It exists solely to provide legal protection against subpoenas. I mean, you don’t know that it’s easy to do this. That depends wholly on how employees may access the keys, whether there’s a log of all access given, internal policies regarding that etc. 

The sole fact that the company has the keys somewhere doesn’t mean that it is „easy“ for an employee to actually get their hands on chat logs. For those who constructed and administrate the architecture, perhaps, but the blanket statement goes a bit too far IMHO. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

Not the same thing at all. I am presuming this was access to someones email. If TGs encryption is segregated like it should be it would take more than 1 employee working in concert to access a specific persons messages. Listen to me Am deaf, what does the fox say? There's *no way* the Five Eyes could get data from out of their country! /s The problem with subpoenas is that they apply to where the company is based. They can then impose sanctions, according to the laws of that country, all the way up to seizing everything, throwing everyone in jail and shutting them down, if the laws of the country where they are based allow this and the prosecutors want to go this far. 
On the other hand, having access to the keys means that the company's owners/directors can hand out data if they ever decide they want to. Of course I'd expect there to be policies, rules, sanctions to employees if they overstep, etc. 
The problem with e.g. Google isn't that anyone working in Google can access our data, but that Google itself has full access to it and can (and does) hand it to authorities and anyone who pays enough.
The same problem exists with Telegram. The key point is that Telegram owners/directors can at any point decide to access and/or hand out user data, for whatever reason that might happen. The difference with E2EE platforms is that owners/directors of those could not accesss/hand out user data even if they wanted to or were made to. But being non encrypted doesn't it make it more hackable? All hail the fox. “All hail the fox” if you say so :D Yes please. They cannot subpoena anything that is beyond their jurisdiction. Here you have explained how they do it:

*> Cloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by* ***different legal entities*** *spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.* Seems like some people at google can/do:

The rest of your post is still correct though. All data is encrypted, but if you’re not using secret chats then Telegram COULD decrypt it. We have no way to know what happens behind the scenes as the server code is unfortunately still closed source.

When I use normal chats I tend to clear for both participants pretty often, hoping that all data is really gone from their servers too.. Govt is probably more likely to get access to your device or device backups than it is access in to telegrams cloud.

If you're doing things that require that level of security I'd advise not using a mobile device and using a security focused linux distro like TAILS combined with PGP. We have no way to verify that’s true until they release the server source code. Don’t get me wrong, I only use Telegram, but that’s just how things are as of now. How do you know the messages you delete aren't still on their servers? Do you have any source where it confirms it's encrypted? I understood that it's not encrypted by default, unlike WhatsApp, unless using a private chat Making code opensource does not verify that as well as you have no way of verifying if the exact code is actually run there. OpenSource does not verify this in any way. Also, based on the nature of this. It may be dependent more on infrastructure and configuration than on actual code. I highly doubt that they store messages in plain text, they would be lying to all of us about it and the project would die if anything about that comes out. With that being said, again we don’t know for certain what happens on their servers and how they handle them, we only know that so far there hasn’t been any (publicly known) private data leak caused by them. Use secret chats whenever you can. On what planet are you living? It is encrypted. There are ways to make that verifiable, but I guess that when they’ll release the server code they’ll also give people the possibility to host their own, so that would be good. Just assumptions... Generally, even if it’s not completely verifiable that the same code is running on their hardware, I think that having it open sourced is better than not having it at all, no? I did my research and that's the info I got, that's why I'm asking for a source to get proper information. Thanks for the overwhelming politeness How would you do it? This is a big problem in information technology. Sorry, but thinking they would transmit chats unencrypted is just nuts. As far as my memories go, last unencrypted protocol for instant messaging was ICQ. and it was 20 years ago. [https://telegram.org/faq#q-so-how-do-you-encrypt-data](https://telegram.org/faq#q-so-how-do-you-encrypt-data) No! Whatsapp was unencrypted when they started. You could easily read messages from people in your Wifi. If that's true, then well it is nuts. D:"

'Underage children' is in the text to the side but no where in the actual body of the Article. >I know that telegram is free and full of resources but there should be regulation to the platform; at least for some level,

No, I don't think Telegram should be in the business of saying sending photoshopped nudes is no longer allowed just because they're made by creepy people. Child pornography is already banned on the platform.

What does this have to do with Telegram besides it using a Telegram bot anyway? This could just as easily be accessible somewhere else. While I understand where you are coming from, I am absolutely against more censorship methods because you won't protect anybody since these people will just use another platform. Isn’t it about reputation!? I think telegram still need to reach to a lot of people since it’s “unlimited cloud storage” will not last forever. 
This will be another way of black marking this amazing platform. Since media heads are publishing on this news. 

For reference research about the way jack bought back twitter to its solidity after becoming a platform of bullying and fake news. true, but I'm talking about this platform and its quality.

take this example, google offers many features but I don't trust it, but apple doesn't offer many features but I trust apple rather than google with my data since they have a reputaions and good practices when it comes to privacy.

All im telling that Telegram should be the Apple when it comes to messagings. if you understand [deleted] What the hell does Apple having allegedly good data privacy protections in your eyes have to do with Telegram censoring photoshopped porn in private messages? Probably, but my point is we can't control the things that will bad user bringing to the platform. but the things they will do reflect on the ""product"" eventually legal regulators will force Telegram and it will effect on the platforms developlemt and the growth, that will effect the users that value this platform, like you and me. 

and also do you think, our privacy is protect in this platform that contain bots that will get any input from a user and create a nude image? Damn dude I said it as a example of product reputation 😂😂 you can’t even stick to a topic The comment you replied to specifically asked you to clarify a topic change.

I don't think 99% of people using Telegram care that someone made a bot that people are using to do creepy things, and I don't see why trusting Telegram with your data like you do with Apple has anything to do with that.

It's like complaining to your ISP because you can access a website with weird shit on it, and blaming them for not doing anything about it. Who cares?"

Even on my super old phones with Android ICS Telegram doesn't drain that much Well known issue, that's the problem with Telegram on iOS. Their problem, not yours.

If it bothers you much, uninstall it and just use their Desktop version. It says 17 hours in background of last 24 even though I haven’t touched it and have as much turned off as possible On my old Moto G, telegram makes the entire phone hang for minutes at a time (as in: not or wrongly responding to input) and drains 50-90% of the battery if I don't force close it all the time. Telegram made the phone freeze and lockup for so damn long that the internal watchdog timer force-rebooted the phone twice already... never seen an app be so shitty in my 9 years of using Android phones.  
And on my current main phone it drains 20-50% battery depending on how much I use it, even though it doesn't (visibly) hang or lock up the phone. I'm guessing more CPU power makes it less noticeable that the app is so shitty... except for battery life that is. It's actually the same for some users on android 11 too.  And how would he use desktop version on the go? Not just 11. Same on Android 10, 9, 8 and my oldest still working phone on 6 as well. On the latter Telegram makes the entire phone hang for minutes at a time, eating up all the battery. I mean okay it's an ancient phone with a puny little Snapdragon 400 (1.3GHz Quadcore) but... jesus fcking christ it's a messenger, not some highly complicated 3D game.  

When the phone hangs for so long that the phones internal Watchdog timer force-reboots the device thinking it's unrecoverable, you *know* the responsible app is pure trash...

Has anyone tried making Instant View work with Reddit?;15;jexbrc;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jexbrc/has_anyone_tried_making_instant_view_work_with/;13;"I send links to Reddit posts to friends on Telegram frequently. I wonder why there is no Instant View support. Is this something Reddit is opposed to?

If not, I could give it a try. Just asking if, maybe, someone already has.";2020-10-20 22:59:17;"It's not reddit that is against it, it's Telegram that is. Instant View is meant to be used for articles, not for social media, because social media is mostly based around user comments etc and those are changing all the time and Instant View is being cached on Telegram server once in a while, so it would quickly get outdated. I would love to see that but given how the focus of reddit is the content behind the shared links, the media or the comment section, I don't see much value. The vast majority of content here is media and links. It could be a really good idea, but if you want to send images over Telegram, you can also use reddit clients like Sync for Reddit, that allow you to send the image or media itself, or also send a ""preview"" of the Post in reddit, that'll look somethink like [this](https://i.imgur.com/T9dVCOf.jpg). If you have iOS, I can send you my own shortcut, it converts any media post to a single link to the media itself My primary use case is sharing memes, which are pictures, so ... Please do. I use Android but an example of a working solution to the problem would be nice. You can share the direct link to the image, telegram's link preview will show the image [https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/i0ooqa/shortcut\_for\_getting\_reddit\_media\_link/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/i0ooqa/shortcut_for_getting_reddit_media_link/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Does not seem to work with Reddit for Android. As in the link still leads to the post, not the image. Also, the text is still valuable. I'm talking general solution here, not just for my only use case. Thanks. The thing is, this has worked earlier, I don't know till when. You could just send a link, and when you click that small image in telegram it would show you the full image.. then reddit changed a bit of their code so it only shows a cropped image now. Their web experience is also awful, just to make you use their app. After all, all they want you to is download their app. Hmm, sharing the url thread in Telegram usually generates a link preview containing a small picture that can be opened as a normal image from the mobile apps, if the post is a direct image url or an imgur gallery/album. But yes that doesn't always work.

As for ""instant-viewing"" reddit urls (the comments thread), currently instant view does not support threads (which would be needed to show the comments forest), so there isn't a good way of displaying a reddit page using IV as of now. Plus for large threads, reddit doesn't show you the full forest of course (some conversations are hidden because few votes or are just to deep in inner threads), and Instant View is not exactly meant to display content that cannot be entirely consumed from within the apps. In fact there's no template that require you to leave Telegram to continue to read something or that requires you to load extra content. Since Telegram's IV pages are generated server-side, it's true that Telegram could simply try to fetch all the content of a thread but that would require a bit more resources and also waiting time, because you have to potentially fire quite a lot of requests to reddit and also wait for an answer. Also another technical difficulty to overcome is that the Instant View for any given article is cached on the server, meaning that if I post an article on Telegram, Telegram generates its Instant View content - and that Instant View content will be used for anyone else that posts that url for the next n hours/days. That means that if someone posts an url to a reddit thread when the thread has 2 comments, everyone else posting it on Telegram would see an instant view containing only those two comments (when maybe now there are hundreds).

Don't get me wrong it would be cool to read comments threads from Telegram, but there are a number of technical difficulties to overcome to make this work Share the image not the link.

If this isn't possible with the official app, it's definitely possible with Sync for Reddit and other apps."

I believe they delete everything on your side however.. [deleted] when you try logging in w a banned number, there should be two options on the pop up - help or close. click help and select an email client of your choice, then email the prefilled form to the prefilled email. Only just delete your account, any conversation with another person remains, although they will no longer be able to find you. all of your personal files and private chats will be deleted. Obviously what you have previously written in groups stays No So when your telegram account got banned (deleted) and you got it back, you lost all of your chats and convos? [deleted] Right but if the new owner of my number gets the number unbanned from telegram and they login, would they all my old chats and messages or would it be a new account for them? No to what exactly? Yes, when you re-register you won’t have your old conversations anymore.

If you want to delete them completely, you can delete them for both participants before deleting your account. [deleted] Thanks for the reply Ry. Just to clarify, I never voluntarily deleted my account, Telegram legit banned me for some reason. I am just worried that if someone gets that disposable number and gets my number unbanned from Telegram, they may see my old convos.

Does this clarification change what you wrote or is this exactly what happens in this scenario? Every digital services do this. You sign up and agree to their EULA, so it happens from time to time to unexpected people out there, it's not exclusive to Telegram. If someone creates new account using the same number they get fresh user ID - fresh account Mhh interesting, first of all get in touch with them to see if the ban can be revoked.

I think that if they unban you, you won’t have your conversations back, and I guess that the same applies to someone else using that same number too because they would be creating a new account, or they won’t be able to since it’s banned. Telegram bans are temporary anyway, so you'll get your account back in a few days most likely Hi, just to clarify I didn’t voluntarily delete the account but instead Telegram did and they banned the number. 

If a new owner of the number tries to get it unbanned, are are successful, would they get access to my old account with chats and messages or a new account? 

Btw how do you know? You work for Telegram or this has happened to you? 


Thanks for the help. The issue is I don’t have access to the number associated with the account anymore. So I’m worried if it does get unbanned, that the new owner will see my old chats and messages. I do not work for Telegram, I used to work on the multiple bots and had access to multiple numbers - whenever you registered new account on same number it received new user ID.

If you got permabanned the account is basically deleted, but if it was some kind of ""soft"" ban and you didn't have cloud password set-up he might be able to restore the account and see the chats Ah. Yeah that's a problem, you can't prove the account is yours Not sure if it’s a permaban or soft but, I asked my non contacts if they can still see our conversation on their end and they said they couldn’t. I asked my contacts if they still see our convo and they can. So for some reason all of my non contacts have had their conversations with me removed on their end.

Do you know why this may be? You keep the chat even if the second side's account got deleted.

If the account shows up as ""Deleted Account"" then it's gone. [deleted] This is were my knowledge runs out, years back you kept the conversation if the other party deleted their account, I suspect when they implemented the ability to delete the chat on both sides they restricted it to contacts only, I don't honestly know"

Im also very interested and would love for their server's to be open, but I guess, since you can post alternative Telegram clients, those can connect instead to other servers and maybe they don't want that? Idk Yes, and it would make it more trust full. Lot of my contacts do not trust Telegram as data are stored in a black box. Opening it will serve Telegram vision. 
They claim to be open and that no government can interfere but no prove of it as long as the server aren’t open source No, you can’t run your own telegram server, it doesn’t support federation (yet?)

https://telegram.org/faq#q-can-i-run-telegram-using-my-own-server You will not know what is actually running on telegram servers anyway even if the server becomes open source. Why would you need federation? I mean your whole backend.  
Modify the client to connect to it.

Sure it's not viable, but its far from impossible That's why you absolutely need end to end encryption if privacy is a concern. Otherwise the security model is ""Trust me bro"". Because of government block of telegram server for example. end to end is pointless without client being open source, because you have no way to verify it's implemented as advertised (or at all). Sorry I guess I'm just too dumb I agree. Isn‘t Telegram open source? The client itself? Yes, the client is open source. You can build verifiable builds yourself to make sure that what is put on GitHub is the same code offered in binary on the official site."

Why does it alert people who have your phone number in their address book that you joined?;19;jdw6m2;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jdw6m2/why_does_it_alert_people_who_have_your_phone/;19;"Seems like a huge privacy violation to me. I don’t want everyone who has my number to know how to find me. I’ve blocked some people from reaching me on my phone, but I joined telegram and one of them saw. 

Is this going to be addressed in future updates?";2020-10-19 08:54:50;"[deleted] to encourage people you know to contact you via Telegram instead of SMS or other services It hasn't been addressed for years, so probably not. How is the notification a privacy violation? You can see at any time which of your contacts has telegram or not Unfortunately this is common behavior, so does signal and even services that don't allow searching by associated phone number can often be coerced to give avay the account.

If that's a possible threat (or you don't like it), always use throwaway numbers for registration (or google voice if you really need to keep the number) and set up second factor other than sms. 

For telegram, you set a password and if someone tries to access your account from the number used for registration, you can change it anytime. Just remember to stay logged in in two places (eg. desktop app and phone, send a few messages from both just to be sure) so you don't loose your account by accident. What bugs me most is that it notifies me about contacts that were in my address book at some time, but not anymore.  Maybe they are still in the iCloud contacts or something, I'll have to sort that out. I thought they addressed this when the Hong Kong protests was a huge issue. There is a setting under

Privacy and Security>Phone Number

Where you can specify who can find you by phone number. You can set that to ""My contacts"", which means only people YOU have in YOUR address book will now be able to find you via phone number.

For an added layer of security, you can scroll down to

Privacy and Security>Contacts

and disable sync, so it will no longer add people in your address book to telegram's cloud. You can then choose to delete people individually from Telegram's contact list or simply delete all your synced contacts at once, preventing anyone from finding you by phone. Just like there's a checkbox to not sync your contacts on sign up, there should be a checkbox to not alert anyone or anything with your phone number when you join. If you have to create an account and then go into the settings to restrict who can find you by phone number, it's too late. Don't allow it the permission to access your contacts. I think if you block your entire address book and install it no one would be notified. 😂 Yeah I think only a minority of users have a problem with it. I like knowing when someone has joined Telegram. That's some BS honestly.

They should have it set so only if you both have each other's number you get notified.

Another thing that bothers me is you cannot block a phone number. Meaning that person can just delete their account and make a new one and viola they are now unblocked. Go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Delete Synced Contacts.

This should do the job! I get that. The problem is the reverse though where people who have me in contacts and allowed it to sync were notified I joined. Absolutely, happened to me a few days ago. I was contacted by two people I didn’t want to speak to. The issue is on the other side: if you're in someone's address book, and that someone has given Telegram access to that address book, Telegram will happily notify that someone about you being on Telegram, without your consent.  You blocking Telegram from accessing your own address book doesn't change this. Perfect, thanks! It is NOT the reverse, though. This is a feature that is specifically implemented because the Chinese authorities found out that they can crack down on Telegram users by syncing thousands of phone numbers and see who pops up. This setting makes user discovery a two-way street. Both users need to have each other in their address book.

By allowing only your contacts to find you, it doesn't matter who has your number. YOU also need to have THEIR number synced in order for them to find you by phone number. 

I also mentioned deleting your synced contacts, since that would also prevent any further discoveries by people who are currently in your contacts, but who have not signed up with Telegram. Exactly this. I didn’t allow contacts access and still was found by someone who has my number in their address book. Huh. I had no idea. Thanks for explaining!!"

Telegram has been running this [JavaScript](https://t.me/contest/196) contest were participants are required to write their own web client from the ground-up without using any existing library. The same way the other official apps are built: by relying on the least number of frameworks possible (well on a second though: tdesktop is an exception because to write a cross-platform client you're required to use some cross-platform framework). telegram-react is heavily based on, well, React.

Is there a limit on number of users? Use a bot like [@Combot](https://t.me/combot?groupstart=start) (analytics is free of charge) to get statistics on who is more active and who isn't.

Lost my SIM card, can I get access with my username and password? Am i screwed?;14;jdaj10;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jdaj10/lost_my_sim_card_can_i_get_access_with_my/;14;"Years ago I joined Telegram while traveling with a prepaid SIM card. When I returned to the US, I put in an AT&T SIM, but never changed the number with Telegram. Yesterday I reset my iPhone and now Telegram wants to send me a code on my phone. But I don’t have the SIM anymore and if I use the new number, I can’t see how to link to my old username and get my contacts back. 

How screwed am I? There must be a way to link back to my username. Otherwise, I think I’ve lost dozens of friends because we only connect on Telegram.

Help pleeze.....";2020-10-18 08:15:39;"Where you just using it on the phone?! I have telegram on the phone and 5 other pcs (gaming pc, work pc, work laptop, personal laptop, htpc) 

Code gets sent to the other telegram connected clients.

Other than that - no idea ask phone operator, if you can recover your sim. If you have at least one client being active (send a message to Saved Messages) you will get the code to authenticate via the App. If you don't have access to your account (ie not logged on anywhere), you're screwed.

On telegram you always log in with phone number, the code you receive and (if set up) the 2fa password. You could have lost this account any time the SIM number was issued to a new subscriber. If you were logged in on any other device you’ll be able to get back in to your old account, e.g. on your computer or tablet. If you manage to get back in it would be a very good idea to update your contact number. This is actually really good advice, it's easy to get the same SIM you used to have from most operators, might just take a few extra bucks. Although I'd still switch the account to your permanent number once you got the SIM sorted out. The carrier is a Cambodian company, no chance to get SIM back. I just picked up the prepaid sim at the airport. So no detailed record. what message should I send to Saved Messages to get a code? Anything. Doesn't matter.

As long as you DO have at least one client logged into your account AND the account has been recently active (e.g. sending a message), Telegram will send the login-code (the 5-digit number) to you in the app (I get the codes from `+42777`, this might differ for you).

If you do NOT have access or the account was inactive, the code will instead be sent via SMS to the SIM card. If you're lucky your ISP might restore it or grant you access, but I cannot guarantee what happens (neither do I work for an ISP, nor do I know which ISP you're with). There is no way to recover access to your telegram in that way, don't believe in rumors. What? You mean you can't recover your account by correctly logging into it?

They said to make the account active by sending a message from the account; presumably, use Saved Messages so you don't disturb anyone. No, you can, but not by sending a message to Saved messages. Just try logging in using the old SIM number and the OTP will be sent to the logged in client. You're objectively wrong.

I received a code via SMS to a number I didn't have access to anymore, used an already logged-in client to send a message to Saved Messages and immediately received the code from Telegram (`+42777`) in the app when trying to login. Precisely, thank you. Soryy, didn't know it works like that)

If you're downvoting, can you elaborate on why this does not fit on this page? It takes more syllables to say WTF than *""What the Fuck.""* It's to demonstrate that anyone can leak and publish your messages. Uhhh okay??  I'm not saying it, I'm typing it. Dude you are sharing private info.  You're fucking nuts Yeah that’s to be expected. You could just do screenshots as well or copy’n’paste every single message. But that’s not what you complained about in the post itself. You said you don’t believe Telegram not sharing a single byte of your information, which they indeed don’t. It was you who shared it, not them. Exactly; that's the message I'm demonstrating. I did not dispute the claim that they didn't.

The message of this demonstration is that there's nothing stopping from the other chat participants from leaking the entire conversation, even after the account's deleted. And they don't tell you if any of the participants have exported the chat. Lmao you think you're so clever Yeah. And that’s to be expected even in the most secure messengers. Telegram claims they don’t leak any of your data and they don’t. It’s people who do. That Telegram says nothing about. No, I don't *think* I am. Wasn't trying to exhibit anything clever. Correct.

But I've solved this problem by changing my Windows settings. I'm on my phone right now, but i'll try to explain. Go to the volume settings and find a tab that is probably called like ""audio calls"" or something. As far as I remember, for that you should open a small window that shows your input/output devices. 
When you find it, there will be options like ""lower volume of everything else by

50%

Set that to zero.

The catch though is that the people have to start conversations with your bot... Something like @livegrambot allows you to send broadcasts to all people who have chatted with your bot... 

However, why not just share the message within this 'community'? It's easy to see why telegram doesn't make it easy to message many people, ie spam this looks like a evil action but you can make a userbot for yourself, generating a list of that groups members and message them one by one. Why would you need to send a message to each member individually?

Just send the message in the chat and pin it with notification enabled.

As /u/-ItzMatt said, sending a message to 1k+ members individually sounds like an evil action that'll only get you spam-reported and eventually banned."

Not sure it's the case, though, just my 2 cents This could happen when they leave their desktop client open on chat with you. Been having this bug lately. I'll know for sure my friend isn't reading my message and it instantly says viewed. Started within the last month and has only happened a few times but it's definitely a thing Or he may have enabled in the privacy settings that nobody can see his “last seen and online”. The person has hidden his online status. if there are 2 ticks✔️✔️ the message was seen 100% Is it possible to hide even online status when you're online? Not with official clients. [That's not true. I have the official Telegram app... ](https://iili.io/3cceKg.png) You can only disable the ""last seen"", not the ""online"" status. You're correct. I was meaning when typing in particular user's chat, the online status will be shown for 30 seconds for that user. Sorry for confusion. Of course you can hide your status. This is not stupid facebook messenger.Don't you see u/aceoftoons screenshot. I have disabled online status. It says ""Last seen recently"" You can see in the description below the toggles in the screenshot that it says that you can choose who can see Last Seen and Online status it affects your ability to see theirs too. It definitely affects both you hid the ""last seen"" status and not the online status, although you put it so that the exact moment you were online does not appear to other people (it's shown in place ""last seen recently""), it doesn't hide you when you're online, just ""when"", when you are actually online, it will show other people ""  online "".  that's where online status comes in to hide that too. Mate, its literally written on the screenshot.

""You won't see Last seen and Online statuses for people with whom you don't share yours.""

If I hid my statuses from you and I chat with someone else, you won't see me as online. I have a second account, so I tested this a little, now let's say I have an A and a B account.

I set that nobody should see B's last seen & online status, didn't change anything with A's setting.

So here is what happened:
opened telegram on both devices(logged in each account), it showed B can see A is ""online"", A saw B as ""last seen recently"".
Now A sent a message to B, B didn't read it, and B is still ""last seen recently"" to A, as soon as B read the message, A can see B as ""online"", then after seconds later, B was back to ""last seen recently"".

This time B sent a message to A, while A is in the chatlist, as soon as A received message, in the chatlist, there is no little green dot indicate that B is online, but A open the chat with B and read its message, A can see B ""online"", seconds later, B was back into ""last seen recently"".

In conclusion, once you set your account's last seen&Online as nobody can see you, others will only see you online after you interact with them.

It was tested both on ios devices, so there may be a little differences on other platforms Yes, that is correct.."

Telegram bug on iOS 14;4;jbt87d;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jbt87d/telegram_bug_on_ios_14/;10;"Is anyone experiencing messages delivery delay in ios? Im using telegram on my pc but when I receive a text iOS app will receive the notification with a noticeable delay!

Anyone else is experiencing this?";2020-10-15 21:26:31;"Intended.

Notifications are delayed for 25 seconds if you used any other Telegram app 30 seconds before that. This is done to ensure that the devices in your room do not turn into an improvised orchestra. Ah I didn’t know about it, did they officially announced it? 

Isnt it would be nice to have active notifications on the device that currently use and silence notifications for the rest orchestra lmao, that’s a good way of putting it. Indeed, this was the case with Telegram since I can remember. Definitely not new and also a very good feature! This isn’t working as intended or I’m looking at another issue. Currently, there’s a 10 second delay for notifications on iOS client. The delay is intentionally added by the client app. The client app receives the silent push instantly when the other party sends the message but it waits exactly 10 seconds to post a local notification with the decrypted message content (I’ve monitored apsd activity on my device). This happens even if it’s the only client app logged into the account. 

Even if you consider the case where the user has many client apps logged in and this is intended so that the user sees the message within the 10 seconds on of their client apps and other client apps can decide not to post the local notification, it’s a poor design choice. 
This delay shouldn’t be applied if the user is actively using the client app. This 10 second delay is really bad when you’re talking to someone and swapping between apps. It’s bad user experience. 

About the design you mentioned in your reply, that certainly isn’t working, because it still applies the 10 seconds delay on iOS client regardless the usage of other client app (within the last 30 seconds). This annoyance doesn’t exist on Android or tdesktop however. 

I think the 10 seconds delay is a really good design IF the user is actively using another client app. But I really hope the iOS client app waking up from background to post local notification doesn’t count as activity, making the design flawed. There’s no way to know which device you have on your hands at a specific moment, that’s the reason there’s not a delivered status (as two checks in WhatsCrap) This was said by the ios client dev in the chat. Starting with version 5.0 iirc, there was no delay in the old objective-C client. But their “seen by” is still out there over us It's not accurate. What if you took your phone and left home but haven't run Telegram app on it yet? Telegram will think that your last session was on pc and won't send a notification to your phone? That's why it's just a delay, not a completely disabling of notifications. If you don't read it in 25 seconds on pc, you'll get it on other devices. But if you read it on an active device before that, the notification will not come to other devices."

Telegram Stickers Intellectual Property;2;jbmq5h;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jbmq5h/telegram_stickers_intellectual_property/;1;"I have just received a notification from the @TrendingStickers channel in which they release tons of stickers. I think they're affiliated with Telegram, but I'm not really sure. I mean, they release tons of stickers, they have to get some funding from somewhere, but that's not the point.

Some of these stickers depict original designs, many are related to popular culture characters and, in this case, they've released stickers from BoJack Horseman.

* Do you know if they have to request permission from the intellectual property owners?
* Does this fall under some kind of ""fair usage""? If this is true, could they, e.g., release a ""Sexy Mickey Mouse"" or ""Frozen doing drugs"" sticker set? I'm sure Disney wouldn't be happy.

I understand that they've obtained permission for doing that, because as the FAQ says:

>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them. But **sticker sets**, **channels**, and **bots** on Telegram are *publicly available*.

They probably don't do it.

>Does this fall under some kind of ""fair usage""? If this is true, could they, e.g., release a ""Sexy Mickey Mouse"" or ""Frozen doing drugs"" sticker set? I'm sure Disney wouldn't be happy.

They probably could release such sets.

>I understand that they've obtained permission for doing that, because as the FAQ says

The FAQ specifically mentions copyright. So if the sticker set includes a direct screenshot of a copyrighted work, it can get taken down. If it's an independent artist's drawing of a character, and that artist allows it to be used or uploads it themself, it probably won't. DMCA applies only to copyright, not trademarks, and Dubai/Russia/etc. doesn't really care about U.S. trademark law. Typically a character's design is protected more by trademark, not by copyright, so artists are free to do what the want as long as they aren't directly using copyrighted images, stills from videos, and screenshots from a copyrighted game. Names by themself also aren't protected by copyright.

I'm not a lawyer so maybe I got a small part of that wrong, but that is my understanding."

Even if you deselect you are notified anyway. I like Telegram but this notification is annoying I have raised this problem on multiple forums. No, there is no way to do that. An alternative suggested was to use Telegram by username instead of phone number. You could try that. Just a voip number to create ur account Nope, no way That doesn't work because they don't have to be in *your* contacts to get the notification, they just need to have your number in *their* contacts.

There's a privacy setting that determines if other people can find you with your phone number, but that's enabled by default and you can't turn it off until after account creation. At that point people who had your number in their contacts already got the notification. For yourself you can disable it in notifications settings It only stops the actual notification (vibration or sound), but you'll still get a new chatroom in your app with the recently joined user. 

The actual notification nudge is what it means by ""notification"". Isn't the phone number required? Dayum, sucks. Gotta be one of the most undesired _feature_. You mean ""contact joined telegram"" , under events in telegram notifications and sound settings? If is that I have it disabled since ever but always get notified nonetheless Thank you!

Now to reply your question. Is Telegram secure? I have no idea but so far if their system was compromised and if any leaks appeared here and there, we would have known it already. 

Is Telegram private? I believe it’s private enough for me and my family to say all the stupid shit we want without having a massive company to snoop on us.

Now I know very well that Telegram possess both the text and the decryption keys (although never on the same area) and they potentially are able to ready everything I’ve ever written.

As far as I know, telegram has not been formerly audited by an independent firm yet

Edit: grammar well they would pay 400k anyone who could hack into an account. Sooooo One can ask the reverse question, how bad is telegram's encryption, is it easy to have information stolen? I trust it to be safe, for now.  Some of my friends prefer Telegram, and others Signal I use both for personal conversations. I only use WhatsApp to order food from restaurants. Lets see what happens if The Earn It bill makes its way through congress. Things could get interesting. It is more like a conspiracy theory, but I used to believe in it’s security after a story when Russian intelligence asked Durov for keys for Telegram’s encryption and spend a lot of resources  for banning the messenger in Russia when he refused to give them the key (actually, he even sent them a physical metal key in an envelope as a joke). But then, after a fail Durov’s with a cryptocurrency Telegram suddenly was unbanned here and even became a base for a video service sir smart displays, made by a bank which is almost belonged to the government. So it really looks like he had some agreements with the Russian intelligence.

But once again: it’s just a conspiracy theory and I don’t a specialist in data security Use Telegram if you enjoy its features like Channels, for example.

Don't use Telegram in chats you don't want to get exposed to 3rd party. Switch to something else like Signal hell even WhatsApp. Telegram is generally regarded as an insecure messenger by those in the security community. In the recent BLM protests, law enforcement was able to successfully gain access to protester's messages (they weren't encrypted 'secret chats'). Encryption isn't enabled by default - why? This is one of the big reasons why Telegram is regarded as being insecure. If you go to privacytools.io you'll get a lot more info and some much better recommendations for private and secure messaging. . anyone with auto update has weak security.

its the easiest vector attack. I have signal and Matrix. Just to be ultra-safe We could fund via crowdfunding a proper formal audit of both protocol and applications.

they currently refuse to add a “don’t alert contacts that you joined TG” toggle when signing up, so the chinese govt can just add all HK numbers to multiple accounts and see who signs up to TG. then it’s easy pickings from there, since the HK govt is buddy buddy with the chinese one. 

so i wouldn’t really count TG for them as a pro... They don't do it anymore. The latest [crypto contest](https://core.telegram.org/contest300K) (as Telegram called it) they still [link in the FAQ](https://telegram.org/faq?setln=en#q-what-if-my-hacker-friend-says-they-could-decipher-telegram-mes) ended 5 years ago (see [here](https://telegram.org/blog/cryptocontest-ends) and [here](https://telegram.org/blog/cryptocontest#end-date)). The first contest [ended in 2014](https://telegram.org/crypto_contest). There have been no other contests about testing Telegram's crypto. Plus the contest was only about e2e encrypted chats (secret chats) - which is only a subset of the whole protocol.

And in general a ""cracking contest"" is not a proper replacement to a professional audit.

enjoy your metadata being mined by FB and given to governments so they can arrest you for messaging X at Y time at Z location. This comment is very misleading. Encryption IS on by default - it cannot be turned off at all. Now, E2E encryption is not on by default, because Telegrm offers features that wouldn't be possible with E2E on everything.  So you have the ability to chose. The security of E2E cannot che questioned, as Telegram offers open source verifiable builds.

The law enforcement part is also quite misleading, they didn't ""gain access"" to anything. This has nothing to do with the security of the app itself. The police asked to be added to a group and used it to identify protesters, and even then they could only see public information (profile picture, profile name). This is social engineering, it would work regardless, encryption has nothing to do with it. btw how law enforcement able gain access?

by requestin to the telegram directly ?
or cracking by they self ?

And people should not claim this is for having chat in every device without your phone, because other services like Matrix are still fully encrypted and there's no need for your phone to stay on.

Saying encryption is on by default but E2E encryption is not is splitting hairs. E2E encryption IS on by default by every messenger trusted by the security community - just not Telegram. The law enforcement part is NOT misleading because no one has figured out how they hacked it - not sure where you got your info.

If you are an activist or a journalist, don't use Telegram. If you're just some dumb schlep who wants to play with a shiny Whatsapp alternative, use Telegram - but don't expect security or privacy from anyone who knows what they're doing. Pretty sure that they asked to be in the group and someone let them in. Matrix isn't E2E encrypted by default either. I believe they facilitate a key exchange between devices for encrypted chats as well, which is much riskier than telegram's model of, you have 1 encrypted device. use your brain.

i also stated that the option only appears after your account is made so anyone making a new account is still screwed, cause they can be found when they initially make it. https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/01/22/whatsapp-facebook-backdoor-government-data-request/

bonus: https://medium.com/@gzanon/no-end-to-end-encryption-does-not-prevent-facebook-from-accessing-whatsapp-chats-d7c6508731b2 Cloud storage, multi device support etc I'm sorry, I mean no offense, but this just tells me you have no knowledge whatsoever in this field. Have you read the articles you sent? ""Hacked a Telegram group"" Hacked this, hacked that..? My 2 cents: the reliability of an article is inversely proportional to the number of times it mentions the sensationalized word ""HACKED"".

Please understand that these articles are aimed towards the masses and bear no resemblance of actual technical information. The fact that you quote the verge, known for its absurd lack of technical knowledge, further proves my point.. (OT: Have a look at ""the verge pc build"" on yt, it's always fun to go back to :D)

Also understand that ""social engineering"" is not a Telegram vulnerability. You can say the same of anything you hear about Iran ""hacking"" profiles. Fully controlling the sms system in the country and using it to intercept login codes of ignorant users that didn't set 2FA Passwords is hardly a Telegram vulnerability, and would work on any app that doesn't force 2FA on people (or even then, it would work for weak passwords).  


Edit:  
Forgot to mention the ""splitting hair"" thing:  You can read about exactly why E2E is not on by default in my other comment above, I posted 3 links about this that explain it in depth. if yes , we can state that there r no issue on telegram security, right ?

thats human error Oh, yeah, it's definitely worse to have multiple devices encrypted than just one??? Honestly, it feels like people here don't want to realise the reality of Telegram's poor encryption methods. [deleted] That is definitely not the easiest vector attack. That would need an FBI team, and honestly, no first world country appart from Russia would do something so horrible to their own companies. So no proof. All data is for criminals.

Trash job you have there.

I'm still waiting to be arrested for talking to Y @ Z location. Again, check matrix.org. Fully encrypted and it's able to do all that. No offense taken, as it's obvious to me that you actually don't know what you're talking about. I'm not seeing you actually refute any of the claims of hacking. I'm just seeing you trying to gaslight me by disparaging my sources. That's not an intelligent rebuttal. If one goes to privacytools.io (a well-respected security and privacy website), one will see that they actually encourage people to leave Telegram in favor of a more secure and private alternative, such as Signal. Other respected privacy sites have similar things to say.

In a last-ditch effort to appeal to logic, I offer the following link: https://restoreprivacy.com/secure-encrypted-messaging-apps/telegram/

I'm officially done with this conversation. I've done my part in warning people not to use Telegram. If they're too ignorant to heed the warnings, that's not on me. Adios. Yes, it was just social engineering, it worked on Telegram like it would have worked on any other app. Have you ever heard of minimizing your attack surface...? That fancy key exchange system is something that can be exploited compromising your messages. clueless.

ignorance is bliss.

go vote for puppet Biden. not even asking you to listen.. its your right to be blissfully ignorant. Its less depressive. naive..

they do it routinely using warrants.. they did it to some mail service a few years back.. they fished everyone

it is not so horrible.. most US companies comply happily.

auto update is soooo easy for them...that's why they love it... New android os PREVENTS You from install if you refuse to accept auto updates. 

frying the frogs slowly. so you want a document of a government saying “yes, we arrested this person because they messaged [person] on WhatsApp at [location] around the time [civil unrest] was happening”? 

let’s pick this apart for a second. why do you think the government would want to give away how they’re finding dissidents? why do you not think they would pick up a person and charge them with lots of BS charges to scare said person? do you honestly think they will just arrest you, a nobody, for talking to someone at a certain location instead of going after organizers or people caught in the crossfire aka easy pickings? 

you must be very confident in your government if you believe they will follow every single law to the T. and i can tell you didn’t read any links i posted in any detail lol, but ok, your loss. keep using insecure messaging services owned by facebook. Ok this will be a lenghty reply, sorry for that, but you seem reasonable so i think it's worth it. I think there might be a misunderstanding here. I don't ""refute"" your claims/sources because the burden of proof rests on you. You seem to be confident that the ""hacking"" has something to do with Telegram vulnerabilities, yet I've already told you how one could easily use social engineering to achieve those results, and in fact, that's exactly what happened. 

Just an example, so that it's clear. let us assume a group of protesters in Iran did not set a 2FA password. They use a public Telegram group to coordinate efforts.

Now, I, policeman of a corrupt oppressive gov., join this group under false pretenses and see that one not so tech-aware member is using his real name and photo. Now, me being the governament, I just check what phone numbers he has in his name, redirect the telegram SMS login code to my own number, and log into the account. The user in this example isn't very smart, he didn't set a 2FA password, he didn't check active sessions, he didn't check the warning of a new login. Now the cop can bypass the encryption and read, for months or years, everything this user says. Would you say this is a Telegram encryption vulnerability?

&#x200B;

Another example that I have personally encountered, as a software engineer who is passionate about reverse engineering and security in general. I can link you an article a friend and colleague of mine made about this, here \[[https://blog.rico-j.de/telegram-session-stealer/](https://blog.rico-j.de/telegram-session-stealer/)\].

So to make it short, a very basic  software that would take all the session files from your computer and send them to the attacker, to be then used somewhere else. This obviously works for anything where you can log in that doesn't force you to re-log in every time. It also works for web sessions and cookies. Ips, machine ids, etc can be spoofed. 

&#x200B;

Obviously setting a lock code for Tg desktop prevents this (because it encrypts the session files themselves). But many people don't do that. Would you say a policeman sending malicious software to someone and stealing their session is a Telegram encryption vulnerabilty? Or human error, for running unknown software from strangers? This same software could steal everything from their pc, including encryption keys for other stuff they might be storing, unrelated to Telegram. Please also notice how Telegram explicitly doesn't allow E2E chats on windows, for this reason among others, trying to save the users from their own possible mistakes.

&#x200B;

So in the end, there being absolutely no proof whatsoever anywhere of a breach in Telegram's server/protocols/encryption logic, isn't the burden of proof on those making the claim that such vulnerabilities exist? Proof does not mean making an article saying that police obtained information obviosly (for the reasons stated above). I remind you once again that all they do in these instances is exploit human error: asking to be added in a group, obtaining OTP sms codes for people not setting 2FA, etc. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As for the security sites, etc: make no mistake, Telegram could give up many of its features, such as cloud groups, cloud 1-1 chats, could backups, authenticating via phone number, etc (I'm quoting from the ""cons"" of the site you listed) and become a 100% E2E, anonymous email login, forced 2FA app. My argument against this is: would users then be saved from human error? No, they would be in exactly the same situation they are in now on that front.

So what do they gain? For the safety of the existing E2E itself: Nothing, the app has verifiable builds already, you can compile it yourself.

For everything else: an arguably not useful additional layer of security (not useful because, once again, it has never been breached). But let's concede that more security is always better. What I'm asking you is: what do they lose in return? In other words, do you think Telegram would have climbed the charts, obtained almost half a billion users, if it was just another E2E random app? It is precisely because of all these features that Telegram managed to get so many new users, possibly brought over from less secure apps such as messenger, Wa, etc. 

All of this while remaining free, which is foundamental to achieve these numbers. (Please consider how accepting any email as login would significantly increase the number of fake, double, bot accounts. It would also make it harder to identify them - currently voips are allowed, but they have heavy API restrictions by default,) I would also argue that while at the extremes (gov. exploiting SMS) an email account hosted on a trusted host is safer than a phone number, on average (think phishing, social engineering, brute forcing, keyloggers, db dumps) an email account is less safe than your sim card. Sms login is not safe, and Telegram will move away as fast as possible as soon as a better user friendly alternative is available, but I argue that this is not the case right now, and people not setting 2FA have bigger problems in their personal tech security than this anyway.

&#x200B;

I think sometimes one has to make compromises to achieve the best possible result. I also do strongly believe that security wise, we are much better off now with 400 million people on Telegram than with 2 or 3 million on Signal."

Message Reactions (eg, Like, etc.)?;9;jaixc2;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jaixc2/message_reactions_eg_like_etc/;22;"Greetings, I'm looking for a cross-platform messaging app with features such as:

* Typing Indicator, 
* Read Status, 
* Message Liking (Reactions), 
* Video Messages (Video Calls would be nice too), 
* Low Storage Requirements, 
* and reliable syncing across devices, with also the ability to use the messaging service on Desktop without having to have one's phone connected to the same Wifi (so probably some sort of Centralized service).

As far as I can tell (I've not signed up yet to finally confirm) Telegraph has almost all of the above features. ***But I am unclear if it also has Message Reactions?*** At minimum I need the ability to **Like** a message (more Reaction options are welcome, but less necessary). I've seen the following online, but can't find confirmation whether Message Reactions have been publicly launched yet or not.

Alternatively, recommendations for other services with the above feature set are welcome too.

Thanks much in advance!

:)";2020-10-13 21:09:45;"Sounds a lot like Facebook Messanger but it doesn't seem to run very well on lower tier hardware.

Telegram afaik doesn't have reactions implemented (yet perhaps) but has by far the best cross platform support - it even runs smartwatches. Replying to a message with a sticker is the closest thing Telegram has to a reaction. If this is acceptable to you then you'll have a great time since Telegram Stickers are quite awesome and hardly beat by competitor. Don't know if it can be useful to your application but the @like bot let you add emoji buttons to your messages. Greetings,

Imho Telegram is the best instant messaging service. (One notable reason being that it isn’t owned by Facebook or Google.)

New features are being added pretty frequently, so we might get emoji reactions soon... 🤷‍♀️ 

In the meantime, as a workaround I use keyboard shortcuts to quickly send reactions as replies, which imho works allright as long as you’re not in a group chat. There is mention of reactions in the Dev docs. This is a strong indication that its coming. I think it'd be worth checking out Signal. It's got all the features you've mentioned. You can install on your phone first and then link it to your desktop and the two then send and receive messages independently. 

It also has settings to clear out messages beyond a certain amount of time or after a certain number of messages have been reached in a chat, to keep storage low. Although bear in mind that messages aren't stored in the cloud; only on your devices. You can delete messages or attachments from your phone and keep them on your computer though, to minimise storage usage on your phone whilst keeping a copy of all your messages on your computer. I'd love anonymous reactions.

Skype reactions are identifiable (who reacted with what emoji). But anonymous would be alot more straight forward and drama free.

Kinda like a passive poll on any post. Rumours are that reactions are coming soon. Might already be in the beta. Thanks for all that -- very helpful! 

Bummed though about Message Reactions... Perhaps someone else can chime in with details on when that might get implemented.

Facebook Messenger, Instagram, etc. are not the route I want to go in this case because trying to get away from social media. But I appreciate the suggestion! Interesting... Can you say more about how that works? For example, does that let me add an emoji to a prior message easily (similar to just adding a Heart or Thumbs Up in things like iMessage or Instagram Direct Message)? Oh, I just did a little further looking... It sounds like one has to call the bot for every message which you want to have buttons for? If so, that won't work, as I need this for conversations where being able to quickly Like a message is faster than typing something. That's encouraging! Can you point me to a link/webpage? The two ""method"" links I included above apparently (according to another user) are in reference to functionality only available to some bots. So I'm wondering if you've found something different in the documentation... Thanks much for the recommendation and those details and thoughts. I looked more at Signal a bit ago, and I much prefer Telegram's method of cloud storage and just trimming local storage without permanently losing messages or attachments. For my needs that is more important than the added security of messages only being stored locally. But thank you, again, for posting. I'll bear all of what you shared in mind if I change my priorities. :) Cool! Any sources you can point me to for following up on that possibility? AFAIK it's not roadmapped but it has been requested. Slack has probably the best reaction implementation of any of the platforms currently. https://core.telegram.org/method/messages.getMessageReactionsList Here is a channel about Telegram beta :  
https://t.me/tgbeta  

I haven’t read anything about emoji reactions coming though.

(Web preview here : https://t.me/s/tgbeta ) Thanks for Slack mention! Any particular sources you can point me to regarding Message Reactions not being roadmapped yet (just so I can follow up further)? The links in my original post seem to indicate that it is at least in-process... Do you know for a fact that is in relation to Message Reactions for general messages (ie, the user to Like a message)? Because someone else said that is for bots:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jaixc2/message\_reactions\_eg\_like\_etc/g8qt6u2?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jaixc2/message_reactions_eg_like_etc/g8qt6u2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Do you mean the 2nd and 3rd links? 🤔 
These methods are for bots only atm.  

They might extend it to normal users though, maybe making the emojis more subtle, as they’re quite big currently. That's not the bot API. that's the client API — for building telegram clients. One could get the impression that it's for bots from
>Bots can use this method

But the method is to read the reactions associated to the message. This could be useful for bots. Say if you had a analytics bot, you could have that bot tell you what the average reaction to your posts on a channel is, or which one had the most reactions, etc.

This link has been referenced numerous times in the devs groups I'm in, when people are asking ""how do I build a reaction bot"" with the accompanying advice being ""Wait it out, as it looks like telegram is working on implementing this as a native feature""

I won't say I know anything for a matter a fact, telegram could be working on something completely different than what we're all thinking of and calling it ""reactions""(doubtful though). But I'd hate to be the one to disappoint you if you commit to telegram just to find out they're not going to implement it. 

But for me; I'd bet a crisp $50 that they're going to implement it. Ah, okay -- that's helpful info. The first link though seems to indicate Message Reactions are in the works though... Thank you -- that's super-helpful, clarifying and encouraging! Hopefully, it'll get implemented soon and/or at least have some public timeline on when it might be coming..."
Initiating Secret Chat : Dangerous?;3;jahfht;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/jahfht/initiating_secret_chat_dangerous/;4;"Hello,

Thank you";2020-10-13 19:55:46;"No, there’s no vulnerability involved, you probably have a public username and people randomly initiate a secret chat with you. No vulnerability. Just block them as soon as you notice the chat if you don't want to see some weird NSFW stuff sent to you. If it continues then try to remove your username for some time or just change it. Maybe your username got in some kind of spamming list. Wouldn't initiating a secret chat create a peer to peer conversation?

And I am sure a lot of people here are the same. I've never had anything random sent to me. No. Content that is not public should not be moderated by Telegram, both because it's not their duty and because it would be a violation of privacy.

Telegram gives you every tool necessary to tailor your experience with the app based on your needs. Explore the Settings a bit. I agree, actions need to be taken. Let's protect Telegram's image and community! Shut the fuck up, i've been on telegram for 3 years and I've never received anything, the ones like you are those who throw shit at telegram without any proof and scare other people to join it. 🖕🖕🖕🖕 /r/eyebleach can help! (From its description: The catch-all community for sharing links which are beautiful, happy, adorable or tastefully sexy. After a long day of seeing what internet anonymity can do to people, you're bound to need some eyebleach.)

I've never had anyone send me shit, but someone did DM me and ask if I had anything in mind that I was looking for, I think they were trying to sell stuff. I just blocked them and it's been smooth sailing ever since.

That said, I constantly report bad shit I see, and I don't care who knows it. It seems like every group is getting spammed with that one 6–9 year old girl in the yellow shirt and underwear. The image itself is probably not illegal, but I still report it (right click the image, report message) every time I see it. Not the group's/channel's fault somebody reposted it, but Telegram can and likely will ban the person who's posting it. It's probably just one or two guys, anyway. Could even be just one guy. Pedophiles, per capita, are quite rare, and Telegram users are a small group (relatively, to say, WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger). So, I do not think there are *that* many of them. What it is, is a few commonly reposted pictures (like the one I just mentioned) and people selling stuff... which is probably just an FBI/Interpol honeypot anyway.

I wish we could see who's downvoting the anti-CP posts and comments. They use burner accounts to post the channels, so when they get banned, they still have their main, but I bet they're downvoting with their main (as well), so if we could see that (we can't, and I don't think mods/admins can either), we could out some pedophiles, who probably have personally identifiable information connected to their Reddit accounts in some way. I'm not a fan of doxxing, but rules go straight out when people go out of their way to harm children. Yeah, me too, and I have a pretty ""easy""/common @ tag and name. Well i wish i were you Stop beign mad. If cant take critism then ignore it I deleted telegram before it gets worse. Well i think kiwi farms can help i guess? I still get traumatized what did they send to me....i still think about that poor child... Maybe the OP joined some shady group which maybe was used as a shell to peddle those things and not getting caught. Are you just getting random messages?   


You can set for only your contacts to message you in the security settings. Have you joined some shady group? Stop being a pussy, if you can't take a reply then don't post Kids get abused all the time, all over the place. More so in poverty stricken regions/countries, but rich kids get abused, too. Many more are neglected or raised improperly (watch *The Florida Project* to see what I mean — 9/10 film IMO, sad/bittersweet ending but also pretty much expected outcome, no child abuse shown or even implied). Not much you can do about it. Seeing a picture of it doesn't change that. If you didn't pay money for the picture, you did not in any way contribute to the suffering of that child or other children in similar situations.

Telegram didn't invent the problem, and it doesn't contribute to the problem. Groups and channels designed to show that crap (""PYT""/""no limits"" stuff) get banned real quick, and I don't mean iOS clients won't show it, I mean Telegram straight up deletes the channel. The more we do that, the more these guys will go underground. They're already flocking to that other private chat platform, I forget the name, it's one of the ones missing a vowel (like ""Tumblr"" but not Tumblr). Will it protect me? I juat did reply you What PYT and No limits mean It will stop randoms sending you messages. Only people in your contacts can send you messages. If you personally meet someone that you want to message in Telegram, store their details as a contact. 

Stay safe. Of course No limits is no limits, it means you can post illegal stuff... at least until someone like me reports it and the group is deleted. PYT stands for ""Pretty Young Things.""

Both are code for CP. If you see either, that's what the person is saying.

If you click on their Reddit name, you will see that link is basically all they've posted, and their account is very new. Did you realise that all of them have arabic name? I mean not to be racist but most of them are arab.."

VoIP account - Account B 

he saved Acc A as a contact, phone number and all. that means if you message him from Acc A, then he’ll see the name he set for Acc A, plus phone number and all that. 

if you contact him from Acc B, and he didn’t save Acc B as a contact, then he will only see the display name and username (if you set one) you set on Acc B. no phone number or anything will be displayed. but if he saved Acc B as a contact, then he’ll see the name he set for Acc B.

Telegram doesn't show original channel for forwarded messages with audio;16;j9r01t;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/j9r01t/telegram_doesnt_show_original_channel_for/;16;"I found a strange behaviour with telegram app.

When someone forwards a message with auido attachement from one channel to another.

Users of the second channel are not able to see where the message is originally from(""Forwarded from..."")

Does somebody know why is that happening and how to fix that?

[ Original message ](https://preview.redd.it/ph1g2i0q2os51.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc534075395972e9710ed4118df16d96a065558a)

(I know it is intended because forwarded music files used to have a forward header that the clients just ignored, but then the devs removed the header servers side as well) Like add a bot to a channel where I will forward?  
Do you know what's the bot exactly? I mean that's fine in general unless you have ""Forwarded from"" sign. With other types of message(a picture for example) works good, but audio.. What is the purpose of this change then?

And btw it's not quite correct because I see inconsistent behavior on different platforms Yeah as u/roman_gr mentioned. Some users can still see ""Forwarded from"" for audio messages. However the same messages can be seen without ""Forwarded from"".  
So I'm not quite sure why such behaviour can be considered as expected. question 1. yes

question 2. looks like it'll have to be a userbot. I was just testing the bot api and it looks like normal bots can't detect forward events like users can. Bots can only see the message incoming but no forward is detected in the case of these audios or stickers.

Userbots are more rare. I haven't made one in years and they're also hard to run, because they require way more dependencies. They're also harder to write because, since there are so many features, the code is not as straightforward.

If you really want that feature, you could pay to make one, I guess, because I doubt you'll find one that's already made.

edit: nevermind, normal bots CAN detect the forward metadata from sticker forwards, just not from audios. I'm not sure anymore that userbots could do the job. The purpose is not allow third party apps to show a forward header on messages that are not supposed to have one.
If you mean why they don't want those messages to have a forward header: I don't know. Just to be sure, I assume with ""audio messages"" you mean music files, not voice notes: the behavior I described only applies to music Thanks for explanation.

I can implement a bot/userbot myself but the problem is I can't add that user to all channles which want to repost mine. I have control over my channel.  


For me it sounds like a bug from telegram, not sure why I can't find any usefull info in the internet I checked that I can see the header on the client I forwarded the post on but not on the other clients It even removes the small name caption to the bottom right. Meeeehhh. Maybe we should report this bug and see if they fix it? Does the header disappear when you close and reopen the chat? It might be a visual bug (the Android one has one like that) I have reported.. But haven't seen that they respond to any kind of questions.  
Let's see maybe this time Try report on Twitter and ask a question. They're more talkative over there."

Delay in receiving notifications;25;j9q4bn;Telegram;https://v.redd.it/c0hp4m7hsns51;12;;2020-10-12 15:38:40;"I have the same, and support confirmed me is totally intended: it's made to save energy. Notifications are encrypted outside Telegram, in the Apple/Google Push Notifications system, and decrypted on device. This is perfect for security, but has its cost in terms of energy, of course.  


The notifications appearing is delayed, hoping the user sees the badge counter before the notification arriving, in this way the encryption and decryption of the notification is avoided and the app directly decrypt the message inside itself.  


This is particularly useful and accentuated when the message arrives while the device is unlocked, and there are other active sessions for the same account receiving the message. there is a delay in receiving notifications on telegram. Also if i get a text right after i close the app or a few seconds after, i dont get the notifications. And if i receive multiple texts from the same user within seconds, i receive the banner notifications after a long time, usually 1-5 minutes. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I have tried turning the notifications off and on again. I have updated the system and app. I have checked if background app refresh is turned on. I have tried everything that was said in various support groups and the faq. But its still the same. This only seems to be an issue for my telegram app. How do i fix this? Telegram on iOS has too much problems with notifications. The worst part is that after you receive a push notification, if you open the app you still have to wait for it to connect and download the message. I think I’m alone with this Is there a way to avoid this? Does this also affect Telegram calls? I find that I am unable to receive Telegram calls if the app is not open. This happens to me as well. I have the desktop app and the iOS app and when I get a desktop notification it takes a good 3 to 4 seconds after to get the message notification on the iOS. If u lock the app, I think it just shows the name of the contact and not the message. I don't know if it will bring notifications faster though. No having other account sessions and having the device unlocked, you should have so much less delay, but not zero delay. It's by design, I guess. No, at all. That's intended. So this happens to everyone?"
Deleting a channel;2;j9nw0b;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/j9nw0b/deleting_a_channel/;5;[removed];2020-10-12 12:39:02;"[deleted] I can't really speak for Telegram servers. I've seen deleted channels stay on my list of chats until I decided to open it. When I did, it loaded the contents for a split second before displaying a popup saying that the channel was deleted. I thought maybe it was loading an already downloaded cache, but I clear it often enough, so I don't think that was it. If anyone knows for sure what is going on here, I would love to know. 

Either way, as far as any common user is concerned, it should be gone - or at the very least inaccessible. Maybe try desktop manage channel, delete channel, it might delete the channel completely.

I haven't tried, but the only way to completely delete a group is by using a desktop client, so I assume it's the same for channel. I see, glad to know I'm not the only one looking for this, I couldn't find anything on the Internet.

So this way messages themselves are fully gone (never done that myself)? I see, thank you for your reply! [deleted] Understood, thank you!

If it bothers you then you can turn out the animated emoji in settings iPhone also gives a haptic feedback in a moment of slapping Do you seriously not know what the peach and eggplant emojis mean in popular culture?

Peach is often used as a euphemism for one's rear-end, and the eggplant can refer to a man's genitalia. Peach and eggplant are commonly used for flirting, nothing weird about it. These emoji are just like the other 20 or so animated ones. *SLAP DAT ASS* This is what is up with the peach emoji :

Didn't know that since I have the large emoji option disabled, but yeah I think it's pretty weird. The 🍑 stickers were already enough IMO. Thankfully I never use 🍑 alone, so I never triggered the animation on anyone's phone. ideal for gay furries. 99.999% of anything I send is non sexual (I have sent 1 sexual thing once and that was when my fwb told me that I looked good in my dress and I told her that I wished she was there to take it off... no response so definitely never trying again)
  
I could totally see asking my mom or someone to pick up peaches by sending a single peach emoji to them And if you do it gets turned off also on the other end of the chat btw faptic feedback [deleted] I know what they mean, but it seems to be a bit much for default action to be that. Also found out the eggplant wiggles. By holding the emoji , you can select bold ( or underline or anything like that ) . If you do that , the emoji won't be animated when you send it Eggplant emoji You are a homosexual woman? are you sure about that? how about in group chats how did it feel Best to avoid using it in conversations with your parents. Totally agree. But Telegram does the same on their marketing; it’s all hyper-sexualised. I don’t really get it. Doesn’t strike me as very professional. Yeah. What's next? Banana peeling itself? Nice! Thanks for the tip! 😊 1. mom receives penis eggplant emoji and replies angrily to her daughter in all caps

2. daughter replies, “mom!  i told you i was going to try my hand at making that baba ghanoush dish! and my message to you was clearly me asking you to buy a single, large, firm eggplant from the grocery store...”

3. confused and feeling sheepish, she runs to the grocery store and the two never speak of it again rude, even in a curious way. Consider be more polite, please. lol I read this as if you were surprised to encounter one of us in the wild
 
Yes I am looks like butthurts downvoted you for asking a question. Only for one to one chat of course [deleted] 
>professional

It's not. That would be awesome. if you send a banana + open mouth emoji telegram actually replaces it with deep throating pron gif It was a genuine question. You had said you wore a dress, and you said your Friend With Benefiets was ""she."" Ususally dresses are feminine, so this entertained the question if you were a female yourself. I don't know why this was being downvoted; it is a genuine question that pertains to the thread.

It takes just as many syllables to say *""Friend with Benefits""* as ""FWB."" It’s just a turn of phrase. What I really mean (which you of course couldn’t have guessed as that’s not what I wrote) is that is makes Telegram seem a bit infantile; if you really want to reach mass market, having scantily clad ladies in your blog posts and having an eggplant that arises like an erect penis will hinder that mission, I would think. Which of the open mouth emojis? [deleted] 😮🍌 We probably have a different definition of mass market then. (i was kidding though)"

Since you have the messages on your end you simply have to press the three dots in the top right corner of your chat with her and select export chat history. Select whatever you want and export it. The messages will automatically get exported while for other media you might have to do it individually if it's over 8mb. Anyway, once it's done exporting it will end up as a html file and you can send the link of the file to her. 

Btw, I use telegram on desktop and am too lazy to check the interface on mobile right now, there may be slight changes.

If there is 3 groups that has 100+ members and I want to see the people who are joining ALL these groups. So instead of checking each one can I find a tool or a bot that checks this things from me? Is that possible?";2020-10-11 11:55:57;"Yes that's possible with a bot Not doable with a bot, as bots cannot access the member list.

You can use a Userbot to iterate over the member list of all chats and compare the results.

If you know for sure that all members are in a main group of your network, you could fetch that list only and check for common chats, as that gives you another list of all chats you have in common with them. Not with bots, they cannot access member lists. Why not, if bot can extract members username from a group why can't it do that. A bot cannot access the member list of a group. They can check a single user at a time, but they can't get a list of all users at once.

Bots can ask ""is this user in this group?"" and get the information, but they cannot ask ""who is in this group"". If this makes sense. That makes sense..and that answers the question then."

Wow Telegram is Number one in the German AppStore! Hope this will stay like that! But congrats to Telegram🥳;399;j8kyfq;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/9152y0l9x9s51.jpg;46;;2020-10-10 17:00:18;"Tons of Germany based friends who appeared on my TG during the past few days indeed. The reason for that is that a lot of Covid deniers and general conspiracy theorists use Telegram here in Germany. Two days ago a semi-celebrity publicly declared that they would no longer appear on TV, that the news can't be trusted, and that Telegram is the only place for ""reliable information"", sending people to their new Telegram channel (which now has 50,000 subscribers). A lot of those people probably just downloaded Telegram in the last 2 days, boosting it in the App Store charts. Anyway you can see everywhere negative things. There is no application without any negative things! I’m happy that my favorite messenger is in the top 1 Charts now! Congrats!!! 🥳
I love using the stickers in Telegram, they're just sooo awesome! Just wishing I was talented enough to make my own 😂 AS it should be, telegram is by far the most user friendly messaging app I’ve ever used, and dev team keeps making it better and better. You can learn so much PD from telegram. Telegram should be number one in the world! Telegram Uber Alles!!!! The fact people are joining Telegram is great, but I hope this will make telegram refine their apps for Apple ecosystem, which are currently not that great. Don’t misunderstand me, the platform is great: everything stays on the cloud, there are Saved Messages, bots, channels, stickers are on the cloud too eccetera. But the apps are bad: on the iPhone, if you tap on a notification, you have to wait for the app to connect, contents are not loaded in the background; also, the app doesn’t do ANYTHING in background, neither download or upload. iOS has strict restrictions, but the first problem can be solved with notification extension services introduced in iOS 10! The second one is common among other apps, but Telegram is the worst. Also, even without doing anything for the user, lots of people have noticed an exaggerated battery usage of the app in background and developers seem to not care about it. 
Whatsapp is far worse as a platform (everything is stored on the phone, one device per time, slow web version, manual backups on external cloud services, privacy issues ecc), but on a daily usage, it just works. Messages are loaded in background and if I close the app the second before it sends a video, it’s not a problem. Also, backups and WhatsApp web shouldn’t exist on a modern app, but they demonstrate a thing. You can have an app constantly download and uploading things in the background even on the latest version of iOS. For who doesn’t use it, WhatsApp web loads chats from your phone every time you open the site, so you have an app running in background basically forever. Something terrible, but if they can do this, why Telegram can’t send a photo or load a message? And the bug makes it consume even more battery than WhatsApp. 

Also, they always say “we are better because we have the cloud”, but the watchOS app doesn’t work without the iPhone. Why can’t I connect directly to your cloud? Watches have evolved a lot and there are cellular versions too. 

Everyone should use Telegram, but they solve some problems. Only in the social networks category and not in the overall charts section but still a good thing! Usually I welcome new users pointing them to useful channels / bots Telegram is freedom!!! Love it. Have been using it since forever. I love the bots too. You know why hehe. Lots of the time it cured my xxx addition 🤪😘🥰 In israel its in the top 5 Now is time to fix encryption. Also Telegram.gains momentum in Germany due to a recent celeb scandal. That sounds great! I have a ton of Contacts in Telegram from Germany! I don’t like WhatsApp at all Don’t let them go to possibly WhatsCrap again, teach them about self-destruction, cloud-based, multi device, playing games, themes, etc ;) Yeah, because of Michael Wendler, semi popular ""star"" that became a conspiracy theorist two days ago and sent everyone to telegram...

Now you can see, who the conspiracists are in your peer group a considerable amount of my friends joined telegram progressively when lockdown occurred This is really sad 😔 Well this just ruined the hype of seeing this lol It sucks that so many creepies are flocking to the app but maybe it will still bring some normal people, which is good. Besides, this kinda means the app isn't censoring people, even the, uh, weirder ones. Personally would be happier without them but it's still a net positive overall. Do you have the link to that channel? It should be taken down. It is really easy. You need just a version of gimp, not even that as long as the image you want is 512 pixels high or wide and the other side is no longer than 512 pixels. Right Right! The notification and watchos problem affect me too! They should increase the minimum SDK Version from iOS 9 to IOS 12! In the Android system I can totally understand that a lot of apps still has 4.4 support but in IOS you don’t have That Problem and IOS 12 Should be there with ease. Ditch Apple and their phones.

You can't even access some channels because Apple said so.. Slave. If the watch connects directly to the cloud, it won’t be able to work correctly with any secret chats. Egal. Does he has a public channel or something like that? If he does, I imagine it was taken down by Telegram (I quickly Googled that it was something related to the pandemic). Sad? Checkout ""officially correct propaganda"" ARD EXTRA documentary about covid19 https://youtu.be/WoRVAnLvpaY

""Keine Übersterblichkeit"", das sagt doch alles. The internet in general is a display of how awfully stupid people can be when they broadcast themselves and get a significant voice in the cover of anonymity. 
Telegram is no exeption but it is important that even the most delusional and stupid people have the rights to say whatever they want because if they arent allowed to do so it wont be long jntil no lne is.

On the bright side they are the canaries we can use to find censorship. Telegram doesn't take such channels down. They only take down channels like terrorist groups or hardcore porn. Oh, I see! I should definitely try that out, thank you! :) I am all for modern apps that use modern SDKs, but the main competitors (WhatsApp and FB Messenger) both supports iOS 9 and above. 
However WhatsApp uses new features from the latest SDKs, so it’s possible to offer features only if the device support them. 
That said, in my dreams the app only supports iOS 13 and above, to get advantage of the BackgroundTasks framework. It allows app to schedule tasks and, if the iPhone is being charged, they can run forever without power limits. Since telegram lets you send very large files, it could be useful. If you have more than five brain cells you can unlock them in like 10taps on your screen. A totally cloud based app may have some disadvantages too, I just ask for the **possibility** to connect to the cloud. If my iPhone has already cached chats, the most logic thing is fetching them from it, including secret chats. 
The problem with the watch app is that it does nothing without the iPhone: if it’s killed by the system, it has to fetch chats again. A small cache of ~100MB and the ability to connect directly would help a lot. Modern watches have 32 GB of memory, LTE and fast CPUs, just use them. But they could at least give you the option that you can use everything except the secret chats iPhone less on the watch! And for the secret chat they could still fetch them from the iPhone! Yea there's quite a few channels from more known persons here, all about corona conspiracy theories. Most known are from Michael Wendler, Attila Hildmann and Xavier Naidoo, ranging from 80k-100k subscribers, none of them taken down. Been going on for months now but it seems telegram doesn't care at all, because at least it gives them A LOT of new users from Germany. Germany has been really behind when it comes to telegram imo, everybody just used WhatsApp because they think it's good and basically everyone uses it so no reason to switch. Now with these channels, telegram has been in the top 10 across app stores in germany since it started, so maybe they just don't care about these fake news, but rather about people joining telegram. What really hurts me as a long time user, seeing this Falsch, das ist nicht im Ansatz so einfach. Die Menge an COVID-Toten ist einfach in Deutschland, anders als in den USA, zu klein um sich ein klares Bild zu machen. Fakt ist: Menschen sterben an COVID. Aber durch unser Handling der Pandemie sind eben nicht bis zu 400.000 Menschen, sondern eher do 10.000 gestorben.

https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/covid-19-uebersterblichkeit-wie-toedlich-ist-das.1939.de.html?drn:news_id=1189369 Covidists will reply that Covid deniers are terrorists.

Freedom of speech has a price. iOS 14 as Minimum SDK would be Perfect (IOS 13 Doesn’t make any sense) but the problem is that there are a lot of people that stuck on iOS 12 so IOS 12 would be great! Everything under iOS 12 is currently unnecessary. Then there is the WebApp +1 No. It can not fetch secret chats from the iPhone. Read up on what secret chats are. You guys are not making any sense. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaqhjwuXnNE&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaqhjwuXnNE&feature=youtu.be) I am talking that the watch could at least get the normal chats from the cloud It certainly could! But that would make the watch feel inconsistent, since it’s purpose is mainly to replace the iPhone screen. That is probably why the choice has been made that way.

How is this possible?

I run Telegram's official desktop client which I use to access both of my accounts. One of the accounts is registered with a number from Iran while the other's one is US and of course the Telegram's client is connecting through a proxy (Telegram is blocked in Iran!).

I came to a private porn channel which I can browse it through my US account while the Iran's one fails and displays following message:

"Apple didn't want Telegram to take down the 3 channels run by the Belarusian protestors, but just specific posts ""disclosing personal information"".";162;j826e2;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/mqip9hlmi3s51.png;25;;2020-10-09 19:28:43;"Doxxing is terrifying. Even if some people out there ""deserve"" to be doxxed I understand why there is a blanket rule against it. Nice loophole wording from Apple, I guess, but the post in the screenshot explains why it's irrelevant. If someone says ""hey, I'll take a glass of water, just don't put any water in it"", you're getting an empty glass. If someone wants a channel dedicated to doxxing to remove posts that doxx people... well, you want to remove the channel. I don't understand. WTF has Apple to do with a private Telegram group? Besides, most of the group users probably don't even own an iPhone... And they are being censored too? [removed] At the same time, there are channels with private information of opposition activists, and Apple didn't mention them for some reason. WEIRD, I KNOW?? Ok. Imagine we are Hitler's Germany. Is it worth to publish SS officers private info? The ones that kill and torture people. Because that's what is happening in Belarus in 2020. Umm, what? So you want to have one person deciding what's wrong and what is right? Censoring and terminating based on their opinion and morals? We already have platforms like that. But we don't have many platforms like Telegram No one should tell the authorities you should not start a mob intend of gutting some old nazi themselves.

If they neglect it without good reasoning however than it may be the only choice to get him to justice but still be carefull it might be incorrect information and you just killed and or damaged the reputation of an innocent person who had nothing to do with it. It is what it is. 

Durov 100% deserves this treatment from Apple. He's trying to be the hero while conveniently ignoring the issues on his own platform. Blah blah. Do your responsibility. You have no idea what's going on in Belarus. The police tortures people to death and there are 0 criminal cases opened about it. If a person who was beaten up and injured in prison goes to police, they open a criminal case against THEM for participating in an unorganized rally. The law is not working in Belarus and you most likely have no idea as it's on the same level as North Korea. And neither I, nor anyone is planning to kill any of these officers. We are gathering evidence - yes, photo and video evidence of the crimes they committed so we can judge them in the court of law after we restore it. All official evidence is getting destroyed by the authorities every day, all evidence from their video cameras, all paper with orders to shoot at unarmed crowd and torture people, put people like logs in trucks and piles and jump on them, put 50+ people in jail rooms meant for 8, leave people with broken bones and internal injuries without medical help in those rooms FOR DAYS. There are 100 political prisoners, over 11 000 were arrested since the beginning of protests in August, they UN has at least 450 confirmed cases of TORTURE, with evidence - and these are just the cases that got reported!

So you are saying it's important to keep personal information of people responsible hidden? So after the regime changes and all official evidence is destroyed, they can just continue their jobs without any repercussions? The state has tons of ways to accessing protestors' personal information. The protestors (who are being opressed and stripped from their right of democracy) only have tools like Telegram. I don't understand why people's private information needs to be made publicly available in order to try them in court for crimes. The point of doxxing is to give their opponents a way to harass/harm them before they are even tried in court. Don't make it sound like a noble cause. Doesn't make the protesters right. 
Pathetic excuse.

This subreddit is full with brats, I see. When an armed gang usurpes the power, they destroy all evidence of their crimes. How can you try someone without evidence? Without that data, we won't even know who to try. They all wear masks! When they try protestors on fake charges, the witnesses are masked cops with fake names! The judge who gives a sentence in this shitshow of a court goes on the list. All judges here are personally appointed by the president and can he fired by him at any time, so there's no justice at all.

Read the news about that's going on in Belarus if you don't believe a random person on Reddit. I'm guessing you probably come from a first world country as you don't seem to fathom the extent of human right violations here. Please educate yourself This is not about being right. The government didn’t gave a shit about people’s vote and this is one of the consequences. Give the information to a third party outside the country then. Why does it need to be distributed publicly? You know damn well doxxing is for the purpose of harassment and violence. It's not related to upholding the law, which is how you're framing it. Still not right. It's bad, full stop. Off with your stupid excuse. We did. [The EU has initiated sactions agains government officials](https://www.whitecase.com/publications/alert/eu-extends-sanctions-belarus-following-presidential-elections) and the lists will be extended as the situation is escalating. These telegram channels played a vital role in gathering evidence against them.

Like seriously, why are you making blanket statements without knowing any context? 

It's illegal and immoral to kill a person. Should you tell the soldier who's attacked by the enemy not to fight back?

The information that is published on these channels that you haven't even checked is the only tool that the Belarusian people have to record everyone who is breaking the law every day which results in death, suffering and unjust arrests. With evidence. There are no other tools as the law doesn't work. 

It's not some pissed off dude publishing personal information about his ex. Dont you really see the difference? Sure... you must be rightist. Let the government oppress us. You're right. I am against doxxing, not rightist. Stupid. When will you clowns understand?"

"""Apple is requesting that we shut down 3 channels used by the people of Belarus to expose the identities of their oppressors.""";199;j7guoa;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/y4t2p79mjwr51.jpg;45;;2020-10-08 20:00:44;"[deleted] How they are able to shut some channels in one platform and not in others? There is some explanation to that? Each channel has a IP that they can block per platform? I wonder how much Putin paid for that. Luka doesn't have the money for something like that.

Considering that all the channels exposing private information of democratic political activists stays up, and they only want to ban the channels exposing information about corrupt police officers, official and judges that are breaking about every chapter of the Constitution and every human right possible? 

Example: they arrest people on false changes when there is VIDEO EVIDENCE and multiple witnesses that the subject didn't do it. A police officer with a mask and a fake name takes the stand and testifies and the person goes to jail! So the name of the judge in charge goes on the channel. Officers that wear civilian and beat unarmed protesters are identified and posted there. People who tortured and killed peaceful protesters, judges who gave sentences on obviously wrong charges. People who were recorder on audio and video to have committed electoral fraud - all the members of the Lukashenko gang that break the law every day and hope to escape the justice. Their private information is the only weapon we have against them - and not to bring justice ourselves, but to use it as evidence in the future when the Law comes back to Belarus.

 
These channels are the only proof the Belarusian people have of their crimes as all official records are destroyed or not kept in the first place. 

So Apple, thanks for supporting a military gang that usurped the power and is currently in charge of the genocide of the Belarusian people. And by thanks I mean burn in hell This is why Apple is facing anti-trust pushback for the App Store - in places like the US. Unfortunately, in a place like Belarus, no one is in a position to really put them on the spot for such bullying. I wonder why they don't bully Facebook for all the hate speech that goes on via their networks... Oh wait, Facebook isn't small enough to qualify for such treatment 😒 F Apple! they are not supposed to know or censor what we talk in private conversations and groups. enter in that channel with any iOS browser going to web.telegram.org and you are good to go. exposing personal information to instill violence seems illegal to me. is that really what you all want? The mob doxxing people can't go wrong /s Technically, yes.

But don't give them hints This is one of the big reasons for shadow bans or whatever an app wants to call it. Otherwise a company risks having an app pulled from the App Store, Google Play store or denied access in the first place. 

It’s one of the reasons the GAB platform doesn’t have a dedicated app yet, they refuse to censor a lot of things that mean they can’t get a dedicated app in the App Store etc.

Apple’s own terms of service might stem from the fact they are held accountable to MasterCard and Visa as two of the dominating forces of financial monopoly who are held accountable by US law.

If you can’t process MasterCard and Visa payments, you’re pretty much screwed as a business as there aren’t many mainstream payment options outside of them - even the majority of the banks have to abide by MC & Visa conditions or many loose the ability to even be able to do inter-bank ATM transactions etc because of how MC & Visa “guarantee” the payments as a company.

In an extreme situation, if a company doesn’t abide by MC & Visa terms of service, they could find they don’t have a bank account anymore (pressure on the bank that relies on service from MC & Visa), or they can’t take payments at all. 

If I understand correctly, MC & Visa are basically a society, club or whatever you want to call it, that guarantees that if something goes wrong, they’ll be liable and foot the bill. This enables different banks to trust each other in instant payments, because the loss is less, and companies the same and down the line. 

MC & Visa have fairly strict rules on what you can and can’t do, because their name is being put to the product and or service. I don’t think they usually step in and cause waves but when pressure is put on them by a governing force especially their own government, they’ll step in and could refuse service all together.

So most will try and abide by the terms, unless you want to only be able to accept cash or crypto currency.

There’s a big divide on internet companies who will give to censorship and those who won’t. The ones who won’t, you’ll notice they drag their feet, even when legally obligated to do so, or they’ll hide things behind shadow bans, to dance around the rules. Well yes technically they can, But I don't think they dare to do it.

Apple can fight big development companies, but they won't try and hit google because they need them...

If google decides to remove google maps and other apps frm the App Store, apple will be having a hard time selling their mobile devices. They simply say, block those channels or telegram is off the app store. On iphone you can't really install apps without them being on the app store. Classic apple move. Kinda the same thing with NSFW stuff, right ? They don't. What they do is flag the channel. Every Telegram client (?) has a setting to block flagged channels. However, only the iOS client actually does it. The others, AFAIK, simply ignore the flag.

Also, there is a setting you can set in the web app or the desktop app to ignore the flag. I'm an iPhone user on Telegram, and no one's been able to show me an 18+/NSFW Telegram channel I can't visit on my iPhone. I'm not saying none exist, but that nobody's been able to find one. The challenge remains open. Since the apps for iOS and Android are two completely separate entities, they can just restrict access to a channel for one but leave the other with full access. It sucks and is total bullying on Apple's part. They would flag them, so when iOS client sees this flag it would refuse to open those channels Not trying to defend Belarus, but these are public doxxing channels. I'm terrified of getting doxxed and I'm okay if there's a hard rule against it. This does not necessarily mean that they know what you talk in private conversations / groups Agree with the sentiment, but Telegram chats, and most especially channels, are not private at all. Channels can be viewed by anyone. ""people"" People who don't wear any insignia or numbers who arrest, beat up, torture people. In USA if ahit like this starts people will be shooting those unmarked morons. So publishing their info in Belarus isn't that bad. That was super insightful! I had never thought about the dependency on MC/Visa that companies have. Actually you can, you just need the .php or .ipa file It takes just as many syllables to say *""As far as I know""* as AFAIK. Yup doxxing is a big no no. There's a doxxing channel that goes after journalists around here and it's not acceptable by any means. Agreed, but there has to be an exception to the rule. I am personally fine with doxing actual Nazis that are torturing children >Channels can be viewed by anyone _who are subscribed to those specific channels_

Different from Facebook, where the information just slaps you in the face, oftentimes you don't have to be following specific pages, groups or people - buy and ad space, target your public, profit Telegram chats are not private at all? Can you elaborate? Didn't something similar already started happening in the US? Protesters being kidnapped and forced into an unmarked van 
you'll also need an itunes replacement like itools or tipard But AFAIK is shorter to write... no? Why are you talking about speech on a written platform? That's incorrect. I don't have to ""subscribe"" (=join) a channel to read its contents. You can just open that channel and read away. Sure. Telegram chats are by default not end-to-end-encrypted. The Telegram servers, and therefore anyone with access to them, can read the content of all chats that are not 'secret chats'. 
'Anyone with access to them' means Telegram employees and owners, if they wish, as well as e.g. authorities given access after a request.
Note, I am *not* saying this is done routinely, or that it has even been done at all. I am saying that this is technically possible and there is no way of knowing unless Telegram choose to make such an event public knowledge. I used to install them using iTunes with no patches or anything, with no issue They probably read out loud to themselves, it's the only way they can understand what they are reading. This isn't 100% true. Some channels/groups you have to join to be able to view. >there is no way of knowing unless Telegram choose to make such an event public knowledge.

And indeed they do. There's a warrant canary on their website saying they haven't disclosed any data. They know that sharing the contents of a chat would destroy their reputation. There's no need to use itunes, which reports activity back to apple.

Loss of Notifications on Huawei P40 Pro;1;j6wo1f;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/j6wo1f/loss_of_notifications_on_huawei_p40_pro/;1;"Hi.

I've had a Huawei P40 Pro since March and, even though it didn't / doesn't have GMS / Google services, the notifications for telegram have always come through immediately without problems.

But something has recently changed. Suddenly, I won't receive a notification for a message and it's only when I open the app that I see there are unread messages. 

I have tried resetting the app and notification settings, clearing the cache, I have put telegram on the whitelist for power management and to allow it to run in the background but still the problem remains. 

I've tried disabling / locking other apps to see if there's any clash / negative interaction which is interfering, but again, no difference.

Does anyone else have any suggestions? Am I the only one with the unique combination of apps which has somehow cause a problem?

I would really appreciate some help / advice (preferably not to factory reset my phone!)

PS - I do use the tablet and PC clients for telegram. These work fine and I always shut them down after I have used them so it doesn't ""intercept"" the messages

Thanks in advance";2020-10-07 21:43:30;Try making sure the aggressive Huawei battery optimisations aren't killing your notifications?

Telegram-Desktop UX on Windows and LInux sucks. Why telegram doesn't follow fluent design on Windows or GTK on Linux but follows apple's whatever ugly ass ux on mac. someone gotta work on that it's disgustingAF .this is how a messaging app on Windows should look like;0;j6ujfw;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/0w8oivdfbpr51.jpg;17;[deleted];2020-10-07 19:54:41;"Please, anything but this design. Telegram desktop could use some improvement, sure, but it isn't bad.  
And this here is... not something I would enjoy using Honestly I absolutely hate the look of that example. I would stop using it entirely. Telegram's interface is fine. Because for windows and linux they offer universal app, that doesn't follow any guidelines. Mac has a native app on the other side.

It's not an excuse, just how it is. I don't think that any messengers offer native windows looking apps to be honest, that's too much work for a very small audience ;( Try Unigram for Windows 10! It's open source, fast and uses fluent design.

 [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/unigram-a-telegram-universal-experience/9n97zckpd60q](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/unigram-a-telegram-universal-experience/9n97zckpd60q) You need to learn how to leave feedback and suggest changes lol. You sound here like complete maniac that can't make a single sentence right no matter if you're right or wrong. Try again. It's because Apple puts really tight restrictions on what apps can look like. You can see it in Whatsapp on Android and iOS as well, in iOS it's completely white and basically looks like iMessage while on Android it looks really ugly and old!

I don't use Windows, do you have a screenshot of what it looks like? What are your main dislikes about the current design? Do you have any precise examples? because TDesktop is a cross platform app.

the dev doesn't have time to make the UI customized to each OS the program will be present on, plus it causes confusion when it comes to UX and makes debugging + support much more difficult. do you want Fluent design on Linux and macOS, or macOS design on Windows or Linux? I wouldn't think so. I gave up and just swapped to an open source community solution that works directly from your terminal emulator on Linux. I have to use `feh` to view images, but I use `feh`  a lot of the time anyway for other image things. I totally agree with you. Some devs always think they “must” create some “cute” UX and then regularly come up with something unusable. I wish somebody made a Telegram client for Windows looking like MakeMkv. I get it you like windows7 look and feel and hate how win10 turned out to be .but if a app release for a platform it should follow native design language and respect that.  I absolutely hate the ugly design they use now I use unigram everyday, I think is cool but I really don’t know if the design is good enough I like this project but the design looks really similar to the current one It looks like Telegram Web, basically it is Telegram Web. Same as Linux it's a photo copy on both platforms absolutely don't follow any ux guidelines. Their client on Android looks so much better though I actually like how windows 10 looks. I, however, don't like it when apps try to force the look and feel of an operating system onto something it doesn't belong. Fluent design in most apps looks like trash. Well if Microsoft decided to improve that hopes it get better . Let's take Android , iOS and Mac the apps are uniform and respect os designe languages . It's not forcing but if apps follows native UI it's feels native and uniform overall a better user experience . I use Linux if I change the theme all apps respect and follow it expect telegram it's looks so out of place and kinda 2010 compared to other apps"

How can this happen?

Does it mean I'm in his contacts list?

There is a slight chance I had him in my previous contacts list in my previous phone when I had Telegram. Would that explain it?";2020-10-07 17:58:54;"Background: Telegram has a feature called ‘Sync Contacts’. When this is turned on (it’s on by default), every time you add a contact to your device, Telegram also syncs it with their server. Subsequently, if you delete the contact from your device, the contact is still treated as a saved contact by Telegram, because of this sync feature. 

This is a slightly annoying feature that frustrates many. People don’t know about this option and this is why they’re confused. This is why, when that contact who was deleted from a user’s device joins Telegram, the users still get a notification. 

You can turn this feature off in Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Data Settings. Hey, this can also happen in following case, suppose you add someone elses simcard(for testing or some reason) in your phone and telegram is already logged in. In that case all the contacts in this other simcard will get synced. Thank you very very much, I was SO confused! What happens if you are notified about a person you've actually never heard before? This keeps happening to me. Every so often, I'll get ""X has joined Telegram"", only thing is I've never heard of X. Never had them in my contacts, don't know who they are. You’re welcome! Also, bonus tip: It’s not enough if you merely turn that option off. To remove the contacts existing (which you don’t want) completely, you will have to delete that contact WITHIN Telegram. When this happened with me I had an old contact that changed their phone number so my notification was for the stranger using the old number of a contact. There‘s also a „delete all synced contacts button“."

What if we could organize our groups/channels/strings into a kanban board layout and give the ability to add custom fields to the description. 

I think it would be several levels of amazing to see Telegram start a business subscription at a super low cost ($4.99 per month or something) and give a software upgrade/unlock features for: 

 Drag and Drop Kanban Board for Chats (custom boards and able to expand into tiers)
 Custom Fields

I think he/she means when you are typing both your hands are placed on keyboard, it would be exhausting to move one hand to the mouse to right click every time you finish a message just to enable spelling, it was supposed to be automatic. I mean human are lazy, if you can do it in one step, there is no way in hell you want to do it in two steps, right?
This is one of them user experience rules? There is no way to ""enable spelling"", you have to right click underlined words to correct them individually.

There's also no autocorrect like there is on mobile. And personally I rather use Ctrl+Arrow keys to jump to where I misspelled and correct it manually."

Why this on IOS14?;63;j63vbx;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/kyapanlptgr51.jpg;19;;2020-10-06 15:08:42;"Things like Chromecast, Spotify Connect or VLC file sharing need that to work. In iOS 13 apps had to ask to use Bluetooth in order to get access to local network; in iOS 14 Apple speared the two options. Telegram never asked me that permission, but maybe you was trying to stream something to a device near you. Do you have a VPN running on your iPhone? Telegram needs it to make calls work. For example there is no need to call over internet if you are under the same corporate WiFi. I was trying to solve a battery issue so i reset the network settings on my iPhone, after I restored all the parameters for my home network and cellular operator this popped up at telegram's first launch (didn't happen before the reset, it just inherited the settings from iOS13).

it's a new security feature in iOS 14. It might be some kind of ad this is letting you know they would like see (to have access to all of your devices.) lol this is such a brilliant app I wasn’t trying to do anything, the message just popped up out of the blue. I don’t understand why Telegram (my fav app btw) should want to see/use any devices connected to my network. Yes VPNs do not affect a LAN connection. I am not sure, I tend to Telegram as an app and their owner too. I guess they just didn’t finish to adapt the app to the IOS14 limitations. And I think that this is just the beginning, I’m expecting a huge mess happening next year when Apple’s anti-tracking features get deployed. So many other apps will get into real trouble, and not just the free ones. Looking forward to that! [deleted] I had a similar issue with almost every iOS app in iOS 14 when I was using a full tunnel VPN. For some reason, iOS keeps thinking that apps try to lookup network devices when a full tunnel VPN is connected. I switched to split tunnel which fixed the issue and meanwhile I'm not using a VPN anymore (I was just using it for DNS which I can do natively now).

Telegram doesn't connect to network devices and doesn't try to see them. You should just deny it and everything should still work. Most likely it will pop up for many apps, this must have something to do with an active VPN and the new data protection features of iOS 14. I‘m only sharing my observations related to iOS 14, active VPNs and the network lookup lockdown feature. Thank you for the advice, but since Telegram still works after my denial I am more keen to using the official version. Thsnks anyway 👍 This “new folder picker” is also in regular Telegram, just hidden in Debug menu. Tap 10 times quickly on Settings icon and select “Alternative Tabs”. Thank you for your explanation and yes, I denied it and it still works. Btw, it’s not exactly a vpn, it’s an app called Lockdown (amazing) that installs a fake vpn. But I guess the effect is just as you described. Lockdown is very good, similar to AdGuard when it comes to system wide blocking of ads and trackers. Meanwhile you can achieve the same without dedicated apps or fake VPNs, e.g. by using NextDNS and their native profiles for iOS 14. Sorry for coming in like this, but can you provide a link to the Lockdown app? I tried looking for it but there's a lot of them with that name or similar. [https://lockdownhq.com/](https://lockdownhq.com/)

You should also consider these alternatives:

\- AdGuard for iOS Pro (or premium subscription)  
\- Just using the AdGuard DNS profile for iOS 14 at no cost will already filter ads, trackers etc. on your iPhone pretty well ([https://adguard.com/en/blog/encrypted-dns-ios-14.html](https://adguard.com/en/blog/encrypted-dns-ios-14.html))  
\- NextDNS - highly customizable, also works with profile only so no app required. You can filter trackers, ads, malicious content, do child protection and whatever else you want That's even more than what I was hoping for. Thanks you so much!"

Request: allow all telegram apps to show conversations in other messaging services.;2;j62u3i;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/j62u3i/request_allow_all_telegram_apps_to_show/;3;"If telegram could show all messages send in services of its competitors, like WhatsApp and signal and the like, then this will allow users to have more choice in which service we use. The reason for this is that it is less cumbersome to have multiple services since you can manage them all from one app. More people having multiple services makes societal shifts in services more likely. It also means people without smartphones who cannot use whatsapp have a more convincing argument when they ask others to be compatible with multiple services.

&#x200B;

all in all, this feature could work against users dependence on the one service that everyone else uses, whichever one that happens to be at any given point in time.";2020-10-06 13:43:12;"That's (almost) the purpose of Matrix Protocol and Element.io ""this feature could work against users dependence on the one service that everyone else uses"" - Here's why it wouldn't happen. Facebook are not gonna let other apps help to stop you using WhatsApp. (I have no idea if its technically possible as well).    

I do think the smaller fish (Telegram, Signal, etc) should make importing messages as easy as possible. At the moment you are able to export a WhatsApp chat as just text or text with media. I wish there was an 'import' section that I could import these chats to if the other party  doesn't also switch. If the other party does switch you can both import the chat and confirm you are OK with it, then in just imports into a normal chat. This way people can be happy to switch knowing that they still have a record of their old chats if its important to them. Of course you are right. The ""market"" has an anticompetetive nature, and I am suggesting ways to mitiate that. Of course those who benefit from it are not going to cooperate. However as you said the small fish might have something to gain from being on the users side, and maybe we can make laws in this vein as well.

""Server-side"" means it's controlled by Telegram server and no third-party client can ""fix"" this for you. Thanks. Comments with reactions would have been great. My guess is that Telegram will implement their own native reactions (there has been an API for that for months), making third-party tools useless A matter of when really. Their implementation of comments is still a bit messy. Not sure why a discussion group needs to be attached to the channel  everything just gets chucked in there - not very intuitive imo. Only Pavel Durov knows ""when"" :)

Regarding discussion groups: I'm pretty sure this was made to reduce server load. Since each comments thread needs to have some kind of ID and same features as groups, implicitly making a micro group per comments thread will greatly increase their overall count. And keeping all threads in the same group (though visually isolated) is really nice for server architecture.

Pardon my bad English Explained it well. 

Also the fact that every channel has to have a separate group for comments. Why can't multiple channels be associated with one group? Just more overhead. Can’t you set the same group for two different channels? No. When you try to associate the second channel, it removes the first one. Tested it extensively. Hope I've missed something simple."

Remember the [Blue Whale Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Whale_Challenge)?   
Well 100% someone's trolling hard. 

Just block the bot and you'll be fine. First of all bot can't send messages to anyone until he started it. 
And This bot just forwards message from some person. Assuming it's @Anonymous_telegram_bot or similar 

It's possible that one of your friends added it to the group, and is playing a dirty trick on you. Block the bot. for screen shots of the thing, i have it on [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TelegramBots/comments/j5iyd4/creepy_bot_messages/). unfortunately that's up to me cause i'm not the gc owner. i'm asking her to remove it though! thanks for your reply!!

blocked it as per the consensus here! c'mon, don't be like that. really trying to get some answers here :( also, do i wanna click on the link? i vaguely remember that name and i don't remember anything good being associated w it. sorry, idrk anything about like, bot making or coding in general. are you suggesting that, perhaps, the creator might have smth to do w this? 

&#x200B;

doesn't that compromise the telegram encryption? granted, of course, the gc owner already compromised it by adding the bot, which as its description reads, has access to messages.

&#x200B;

also this bot isn't new; the gc owner added it a while back for the lols. yup, it's that bot! this time round, its possible that one of them sent it given their last seen. when we got the first message, however, no one was online recently enough to send that. tried googling, found nothing.


also don't really wanna pull the old ""i dont think my friends would do this"" but they really arent the pranking sort. 


as for adding the bot, my friend (gc owner) added it for the lols way before we even got the first creepy message. 


just made a report to its creator(s). do you suggest that i ask the gc owner to remove the bot in case there's smth wrong w it?

edit for format seems like a general consensus here. i'm also wondering if the creator might have done something wrong or if the chat privacy has been compromised. Block it and move on. Is just a stupid bot. no. Making bots on telegram's easy actually since the API and code for Telegram's open source. As for encryption, no not really. It's more just logic, don't click links that seem bad/fishy/problematic and use common sense. 

100% the bot's just a creepy-pasta wanna be. In that case, yeah just block it and ask the GC owner to remove it, as others have said. Well, telegram bots can be used as an anonymous profile by the person who creates it.
For example if you ,let's say cat, create a bot and your friend,let's say dog, starts chatting with your bot. You can configure your bot to indirectly speak to dog without dog ever knowing the bot's creator being cat.

It can be a good prank if the premise is well thought out and executed properly but in your case, just blocking it will reverse prank on them.

Edit: Don't click on any link. aight! thanks, seems like that's the general consensus here! i'm also just trying to understand a bit about it so i can put myself as ease! >telegram bots can be used as an anonymous profile by the person who creates it

right, right. this makes perfect sense. i get it now, the creator (and who ever has ctrl over the creator's account/device, i'm assuming) would have the ability to send smth through the bot. so it doesn't have to be anyone in the gc at all.

thanks for the explanation!! >Don't click on any link

well, shit. clicked on what i assumed to be its creators website. got a 502 error though; hopefully that means i didnt manage to get onto the website. Uhuh, well, if you have a antivirus a full system scan would be nice.
Although I don't think anything got in. great, hi, you're still online. there isn't a block option so i just clicked the ""stop bot"" button. would that do?

sooooo sorry for having so many questions and thank you so much for the help!! There's nothing to apologise for :)
Yeah stop bot should do the trick.
After that go to your privacy and security settings, under blocked users the bot should be listed. thank you soooo much! it's in the list like you mentioned!

you've been a great help! even though i dont believe in the supernatural, i'm still creeped out by things i don't understand! your help has been great because i can legit feel my pre-anxiety physical symptoms coming in! they're gone now because of you! really can't thank you enough!

urgh, who would do such a cruel thing? imagine if the receiver believed in the occult. I'm glad, I get what you went through , my girlfriend gets creeped out by things like these as well and believe me it's a good thing, especially in this age.

\> Making calls.

I also have a lot of groups subscribed to which probably download smth on the background but maybe not... Have you tried asking support volunteers for help? Important is to have App Background refresh off and also sometimes just deleting and reinstalling might help. Trading View? Ah, I see you man of culture as well. Btw, same thing, I guess this is just how it is, you've got the best messenger in the world, but it eats your battery like that. Seems odd. I checked the battery usage on my iPhone X on iOS 13.5.1 and its just 2%. I use it a lot and it doesn’t use all that. Really strange. If you don't have apps working in the background, try the following: go to settings, select reset, then choose ""reset network settings"" and then do the same with the option ""reset location and privacy settings"". I guess ios has errors in network control and permissions. You Android and flush that iPhone But can I have same groups as I have on telegram? You made me discover that app. Thanks! Still looking for the best Telegram client, but Nicegram is really good. Have Link? I solved it by removing the background download option.  Thanks a lot 😃 I did not. Where I can find them? Thanks It is Telegram issue, asking Support is no use to be honest. tried everything. and yes background refresh and notifications are turned off App background refresh does not affect anything, it doesn't matter if it's turned on or off, the app uses another way to fetch messages. Also, even if you disable notifications for Telegram in iOS settings, it will still download messages in background. Haha, Ive deleted it. Gonna use it on my pc for now till this is fixed. I cant afford ruining my phone by an app that im using it for like 30 mins per day damn thats awesome lol, I really hope with 14.2 this will work. good Ive been using it for 3 years. Got this problems since one week Tried that as well. Did not help. Thanks you will have same groups and chats You won't get new features(like channel comments) right away though. That's the downside for any unofficial telegram client. Have to wait for the devs to implement them. Nice. Not working for me... tried that as well Settings > Ask a question And their support doesn’t accept new people hardly ever but takes literal months to respond. That’s so weird! Ugh [deleted] May be you have many old messages which demand resources for its bookkeeping? Have you try using one on another phone having no old messages? no problem for me, not use them anyways lol Try uninstalling Telegram, restarting iPhone and installing it by turning off the backround download option not available in my AppStore There's no Telegram X for ios anymore. Tried, not working"
How to host an AMA in a Telegram group;0;j506dx;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/j506dx/how_to_host_an_ama_in_a_telegram_group/;6;[removed];2020-10-04 17:54:08;"go to group settings and change permission of your group by clicking on toggle button in front of send message in ""what can members of this group do"" section, and promote the person to admin to whom you are going to do AMA with. Hard to achieve on Telegram with your requirements (muted group except two persons while keeping the same group where people usually send messages). Maybe a bot deleting all messages except from both of you, but I don't know which one, then remove the bot after AMA. And your AMA would look like messages and inline replies. Brilliant, thanks for this.  This looks as if this will work. That's a pity that you can restrict everyone from sending messages but you cannot make an exception for certain people Thanks for that.  I see other groups doing it all the time, I think the reply below should sort it.  Thanks. Thanks, I think the solution is from u/custom_wp below."

For end users, yes if you don't trust Telegram.

For end users, gone forever on Telegram servers (you might have an offline copy though). For them, technically, I don't know because I assume there's data redundancy.

Last night Telegram was down for about an hour in Europe due to hardware malfunctioning. Some iOS users who tried to access Telegram during this time may have been logged out and will unfortunately have to relogin.

We have already fixed the iOS app and the update is on the way to the App Store. We are also tweaking our networking software to minimize the risk of such issues in the future.

Telegram has a unique custom-built multi-datacenter infrastructure spead across the globe. This approach allows us to make things very efficient in terms of speed, security and cost, but can also pose some challenges in times of rapid growth. Each week, at least 10 million new users sign up for Telegram, and we are constantly scaling both our software and hardware.

Just look at the map ?  Really, you think it's a logical conclusion that Belarus would DDoS telegram because of EU and US sanctions?  Seems REALY far fetched and lacking a few important valid premises to make that argument logical.
 
Telegram is a platform the EU and other globalists would LOVE, L O V E to deplatform, they already do this with other sites such as voat, they're not exactly bit on free speech, LOL! Map shows only what the users had reported. Telegram is very popular in Belarus, hence the amount of reports. 

At this point, Telegram appears to be down worldwide, so that link is more of a popularity map. The map isn't an accurate judge because it doesn't take into account % of users per area.  It's out here in DC and NoVA, but not showing on map. of course it's not accurate as it only show clear outage in regions that has a huge telegram user base also what i said is speculation"

Hey guys. Anyone know how to fix this? Brand new iPhone 11 pro. Background app refresh is off. Telegram is closed and still drain my battery like hell?;1;j4ezj4;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/hhfruic1tvq51.jpg;15;;2020-10-03 16:27:31;"Telegram supports VoIP notifications, which can receive messages while it’s in background. It’s not controlled by the “Background App Refresh” switch. telegram is the most battery-draining app on my phone, mainly because I really do use it a lot.
If you didn't use it as frequently as I am, besides what you did, you can turn off its notifications for a day to see if it changes. 

Sometimes when an app is acting weird draining lots of battery, restart the system(phone) may fix it, I won't say it will fix it for sure, just a way you can try. Hope it helps. In my case it consumes battery in the background only when I leave the application open in multitasking, if I close it I have no problems But after each use i am closing it, I mean i close it with swapping Well i use it a lot too. Everything is turned off. And after each use Ive close it completely. Restarted the phone did not help. Well ive always close it and still There is a background process that continues to receive messages even if the app itself is closed. Mine is currently 44%， so I guess this is normal？ “Closing” the app will cause more battery use than letting it run since it’s anyways running due to the background process. So when you force close the app it will restart almost immediately which drains battery (loading the app from flash into RAM again).

Similarly other apps you might use a few times per day (let’s say Notes for the sake of argument) shouldn’t be closed. If there is space in your RAM and Notes can be still cached after some minutes or even hours and you access it again it doesn’t have to be reloaded from flash storage hence saving battery by not force closing it manually.
Let the operating system take care of the RAM. Well how to turn off this. Its killing my phone Well for me its not normal. App that I use like 1 hour per day, to drain 44% of my battery per 24h I know, but this is not the problem I don't have an iPhone. Have you tried clearing the cache, reinstalling the app, etc? Make sure you are logged in on another device before you uninstall though. Okay, only one hour 44%, that’s a lot, mine is 3hours 44% Yeah lol"

Check among the archived ones. I have the problem sometimes when I read the update news on another device. I have to open the chat with the update news again, then the message disappears. muted chat?

[Q] Instant translation of messages in Telegram groups?;8;j3rdrj;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/j3rdrj/q_instant_translation_of_messages_in_telegram/;11;"Hello! 

I was wondering if there is a function or bot on Telegram that allows me to see instant translations of messages that I receive in a foreign language. 

Any help is welcome. Thank you!";2020-10-02 12:16:53;Try with @YTranslateBot works inline and bot chat In this particular case the translation should only be visible to the person who needs the translation. I moderate a telegram group where not everyone is a Native German speaker. Ideally, a bot runs in the background that enables every group member to translate messages to English without it being shown to the rest of the group. Facebook has a translation feature for posts and comments which I find very helpful, I miss it in instant messengers. I don't think it is possible to send messages to a group that only one user can see. The only way would be to send the translation via private chat, what I think will not be practical. Just found The TranslateMe Translator App. It's an additional app you need to install on your phone that accesses telegram. It works fine but I hope telegram will implement this feature in their own app soon. Thanks for your help though! Google translate with open popup text Translation It could do the job You can use plus messenger or telegraph both have instant translation option Plus Messenger has built in support, there's a few other too but I haven't tried them. In that case a bot won't suffice, you will need a 3rd party Telegram client with built-in translation such as Catogram or Plus messenger Could you please share what bot you are using for translation?

It's up to you/owner to assign a title or continue without it. Bro it's intended to be like this, you're anonymous to everyone that's not an admin or doesn't know whose the custom title assigned to It's by design, Telegram support told me. The custom labels are not on mandatory and is useful to diversificate anonymous senders in a way that is not common. You’re concerning that the group member already know you as certain admin title, so even if you name is hidden, members can still identify you as which admin. Just ask the creator to rename admin titles then. That will definitely solve your problem. It's not primarily designed to hide who wrote the message. It's to keep users from reaching your profile via the message and to be able to write on behalf of the entire group.

The admins are the ones who control the admin titles, so if your title gives away who you are and you don't want that, change it. It's your own fault. The feature was explained perfectly, so you should know that already."

[https://telegram.org/blog/filters-anonymous-admins-comments](https://telegram.org/blog/filters-anonymous-admins-comments?ln=f)";2020-09-30 19:21:56;"still waiting for message reactions👀 Comments seem like a good idea and I bet reactions are next. Or these are an alternative to reactions because comments are a bit more in-depth, instead of just someone pressing the eggplant emoji on a post. So excited for anonymous admins! Looks like they tolled it out with Belarusiand in mind Having threads in normal group chats would be so helpful. Currently it works only with supergroups which are linked to channels. In the new search engine I can't search for certain words and phrases in all channels I'm subscribed to. Now it only searches within chats and I need to be able to search in all channels at once like before. I can't send audio messages in desktop version( Am I the only one having this bug? So since this update I'm experiencing a few issues in Telegram for iOS:

1) The share sheet is not working anymore, Telegram is not listed as an app to share files etc. to in iOS  
2) Message previews from lockscreen or inside iOS aren't working anymore, every push will only say ""you have a new message"", but without the sender or content being displayed

Tried the reset options in the hidden menu but nothing helped. Anyone else? just fix watchos app, it’s a mess How do you use the anonymous feature? Please, provide switcher in settings to hide comments. I've connected the discussbot to see its features and such and I've noticed it automatically turned my into an anonymous user in my group. I'm not interested in being anonymous, how do I revert back? I removed the bot. The only thing I feel like is really missing from Telegram Reactions to comments would fit nicely IMO They are no alternative because they can't be used in groups, only in channels with a connected group Yeah I disappointed it's not available on normal groups. The developer is aware of this bug and will fix it later today: [https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/8673#issuecomment-702035162](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/8673#issuecomment-702035162) Are you sure it was DiscussBot who ""turned"" you into anonymous user? Anyway, please go to admins list, tap on yourself and remove ""Send anonymous"" permission. Don't forget to save/apply changes. Together with conference call. Yeah, they could combine them. Although that does make me a bit worried about things getting too close to Facebook in terms of design, lol. If they implement reactions next, we can expect threads across all groups. This has been a great year for telegram anyhow. Oh, thanks! Yeah it was the only thing I did, I've invited the bot, I've linked channel to my group and tested the comments feature. Now I've removed the bot and deleted channel link and I'm stuck in anonymous mode now.

Thank you man. I've never messed with admin permissions, so it must be one of the above actions or bot that did it. I don't like reaction feature and don't understand how it's relate to the view thread option? Did you try steps I mentioned above? Not directly related, of course. But reactions and replies work alongside each other. Kind of like facebook posts. No one can guess how telegram is going to implement it, though. Yeah, it exactly what you've told me. The admin permissions were changed to ""Remain anonymous"".  It's a new feature, I didn't know it was even a thing. Did it work? Did you manage to disable this setting?

Also, just curious: do you see ""DiscussBot changed {your} permissions"" in Recent Actions? That's really strange and this bot shouldn't do that. Yep, I changed it back to off. 
Nope I don't see any in recent actions.

[Q] How to disable/adapt Instant View for ads/premium content;0;j2kyel;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/j2kyel/q_how_to_disableadapt_instant_view_for_adspremium/;5;"I'm working in a newspaper company and we have a Telegram group that links to news as soon as they are posted in the website. The problem with this is that if people use Instant View, all the advertisements we have are useless and if the news published is one only available to subscribers, even free users can bypass it using Instant View.

Is there any way to ensure the access of the users and the visualization of the ads? If not, how can I disable Instant View?";2020-09-30 15:13:44;"\- The goal of Intant View is to stay focus and get a clear page that is nice to read, there is no way to ensure the visualization of the ads because Intstant View has been made (among other things) to not display them  
\- Instant View is a telegram feature, and the Instant View are gerenated on Telegram servers, it's is impossible to disable it Well, Instant View probably (!) was designed to provide ad-free experience feature along with in-app reading (it's my own thought, I'm not affiliated with Telegram).  

First of all, the best thing to do might be contacting Telegram in Twitter. They can disable the ""official"" template for your links.  

However, since Instant View is somehow an ""open platform"" located at [https://instantview.telegram.org](https://instantview.telegram.org/), any person can make their own Instant View templates and adapt your website pages to Instant View format. And I don't think Telegram can disable it (though they probably can achieve it via some server-side toggle). 

You may try to mess with DOM of your HTML pages or implement other anti-parsing methods, but remember that it will also reduce your website accessibility.

As a footnote, again, I suggest reaching Telegram via Twitter or via [https://telegram.org/press#press-contacts](https://telegram.org/press#press-contacts) Yeah, that's the problem we have. I'm okay with it offering ad-free experience, but forcing it is a bit sketchy for our website for example. 

I'll try contacting them and see what happens. Thanks for your response. Hi I'm also interested. Did you get any feedback from Telegram? I never contacted them since I saw online that it's in their policy to have that setting."

So to avoid that, I should put the group in public kick them, put the group back in private right? You're not wrong, but they're asking about Telegram, and ban practices aren't meant for people you don't like, but rather spammers and scammers. The purpose of a shadow ban is to make the spammer think they're still getting through, so they don't rush to make a new account that isn't banned. Yes you could try it but I think they would still mow and if they have your username you would have to block them too so they don’t private message you How are people making new Telegram accounts so easily?

Why does Telegram got 2 iCloud options? Doesn’t Telegram have its own cloud?;20;j1asun;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/j1asun/why_does_telegram_got_2_icloud_options_doesnt/;14;"So, before jumping in let me say that I am NOT asking about Telegram’s iCloud backup that iOS perform to the entire device. This is the backup that contains apps settings and cache. 

I am asking about “Apps Using iCloud” section. This section is supposedly for apps that are actively using iCloud to read and write data. 

What’s going on?";2020-09-28 15:09:46;"Okay, I checked the source code.

iCloud storage is used for Telegram Passport, a feature that was developed to securely store personal information and documents on Telegram that could then be used by bots/websites.

https://telegram.org/blog/passport

I don't know of any service that uses it. When you tap on ""Manage Storage"", you can see how much each app actually uses. In my case, Telegram isn't even listed there. I don't know why it requests the permission, but it doesn't seem to use it. Maybe just an oversight. [removed] Thank you! Is it on the back burner now or something? I've never seen any info about it, did it just not catch on? For me, when I go to “Choose Data to Back Up” I find Telegram right there. It’s off because I toggled it off yesterday. Signal also got one and nobody seems to know what is going on. You can back up your chats to iCloud in WhatsApp, that's why it needs access. This is separate from the full device iCloud backup, which also contains every app's data. From the Telegram website it looks like the feature is done and working, but if no platform uses it or even knows about it, it's useless. This is a different setting regarding your full device iCloud backup. By default, the iCloud backup is complete and contains every app's data. You can manually exclude apps from that backup to save iCloud storage.

Apps don't have access to iCloud backups. This is purely an iOS function that lets you restore your whole device.

Apps can manually write files to your iCloud if they request that permission. WhatsApp does this so you can manually back up your chats and restore them without having to restore your whole device.
Telegram also requests that permission, but I don't know of any functionality that uses it - and it hasn't written anything to the iCloud in my case. I’m not sure what you’re trying to say... This is basically my question. I already stated in my question that I’m aware of the two options. I'm just saying that the first option is from iOS and is there for every app.

The second option, manual access to the iCloud, just gives an app its own storage space in your iCloud. It doesn't get access to any other app's data. Telegram requested that storage space, but never uses it - you can check how much it uses. It's a bit strange that Telegram would request the permission if it doesn't need it, but it's nothing to really worry about either. I’m aware of that. And that’s why I’m asking over here why Telegram got that as an option because supposedly it does not use iCloud. Also, this option is automatically on when a new app that can use the cloud gets installed. The same happens with Signal. I removed it and deleted all it’s backed up data and when reinstalled the option to use iCloud was already on. There is no permission modal for the iCloud storage permission in iOS. Probably because it's not security or privacy critical. Apps don't have to request storage permission for writing to their own device storage either.

My guess is that it's simply an oversight. But the app's source code is public, so anyone could check if it's used for anything."

Even if the government was _communist_, they could not read telegram messages without their encryption keys. Knowing that Russia has been trying to so that during years, I wouldn't be worried.

Also, what is that important you need to keep in utmost secrecy? Are you some kind of dissident hero to overthrow this _communist_ government? The Russians tried it. And gave up. 
Spain is no Russia. tranquilo master Comunista? [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Yeah, Pablo may think whatever he wants, as well as Pedro, supposedly a socialist who's not at all in reality. That being said, I still don't think Spain's \*Government\* is communist, in spite of what their heads think; many other countries' governments are made of several parties and you wouldn't say they are this or that because these parties are this or that. Dialogue is something good. A true left-wing (not even communist) government wouldn't defend the corruption of the monarchy we are facing nowadays nor avoiding to solve the territorial crisis we are facing now.

I would mind my words if I were you. The [last guy](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%88ric_Bertran_i_Mart%C3%ADnez) who said he had an army was about to face prison time. Although... yeah, you probably don't fall in the same ideology as him, so you're probably going to be fine.

Reading your other comments in this thread I see you quote WhatApp's measures to combat \_misinformation\_. Does that word mean anything to you? I recall extreme-right groups were very pissed by this measure. I don't pretend to judge you, but talking of an \_army\_ and then quoting this measure helps me make an idea of what you're thinking.

So, back to the relevant discussion, per the [FAQ's](https://telegram.org/faq):

>Please note that this does **not** apply to local  restrictions on freedom of speech.  For example, if criticizing the  government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such  politically motivated censorship. This goes against our founders' [principles](https://mashable.com/2015/05/18/russias-mark-zuckerberg-pavel-durov/).  While we do block terrorist (e.g. ISIS-related) bots and channels, we  will not block anybody who PEACEFULLY expresses alternative opinions.

Emphasis on PEACEFULLY added by me. Army and peace are quite antonyms.

Good luck on defending Una, Grande y Libre when it is not. Hopefully you learn that the good thing about Spain is that it's made of different nations that deserve respect instead of being humiliated during centuries. Cómo lo censuraron?

However, their names do not appear on my Telegram contact list. Hope that helps. No. Otherwise your contact list would get a whole lot of people on it that you don't want no if you're sure that you never shared it This happens when you have ‘Sync Contacts’ turned on. It’s a sneaky irritating feature sometimes. If this is on, and you delete a contact from your phone subsequently, Telegram still has the contact saved. Can confirm Thank you yes that makes sense.. That sounds really stupid. Why havent they fixed it yet dangit Aww really? That’s real annoying. Tbh I don’t think we need these notifications in the first place. :/

I wonder if that said user also still have our number saved on their phones? Do you know anything about that?

I’ve had a random number texting me when I first joined the app. (I’ve hid my number btw) Settings > Privacy and Security > Delete Synced Contacts Ikr. I’ve seen it discussed on other platforms in the past. They should get it sorted out. Yes, that’s definitely possible, because that option is turned on by default. And most people don’t know about it. Hence, even if they’ve deleted the contact from their devices, Telegram still treats it as a ‘saved contact’. Ah I see, got it.

[Q] Why does some telegram files have slow speed other very fast?

I don't know how Telegram works behind the scenes, but I assume it all depends on how overloaded servers are and where the file was uploaded.

- If lots of people are downloading the file or if it's on a machine that is under a lot of load, speeds may be slower.

- Since telegram has servers in different continents, if a file is uploaded in Asia and is downloaded in Europe, then it might be slow until a copy of the file exists in their European servers.

I've also noticed that some networks don't have the best speed, maybe due to bad peering or some kind of limitation to prevent abuse. I see slower speeds when using some VPNs, even though the speed is fine for other stuff. First It took few minutes Then BooM amazing speed.

Thank you I am sure it wouldn't have great traffic as movie is very uncommon, not many people download it. Servers are stored in other continents may be problem but I think when I save it to my cloud it should have a copy in in area server. Search for keys around in Google to put that onto the app to unlock the huge Petabytes of data. Servers host more than one file. It's not only the file you're trying to download that it's there, so it's possible for it to be slow even if no one is downloading the same file as you.

In any case, it's a free service and they need to make things work in a way that's economical for them. Tried around 15 of them, showed unknown error occurred Yes, I understand but other files download at high speed.

I liked idea of economic way. Maybe unused files have slow speed. I am interested to know how to download them fast. :'( Check pm"

Telegram has no accountability and transparency I have a telegram name. I’m not sure if that’s the same thing or not but they stole a lot of money. So I just put the user name of the person who scammed in there? Will it notify them that I tagged them whats the point of that ? I don’t accept that Serious question: how does one loses a lot of money with Telegram? Those user names can be changed. User ID's can't unless you make a new account.

Other then that I'd suggest contacting your local law enforcement with all the information you can gather.. Ah no you forward a message from them to the bot.

They will not get a notification. You can change your username, name, etc, but not your user ID unless you make a new account. You can wait for the boss, until the cows come home :) Lol, how did you get scammed? Retard Who are you talking to"

I, personally would like to have multiple options customizable by “chat group”:

1) Show read (standard Telegram double checkmark).
2) Show read and by who (similar to stock Facebook chat).
3) Do not show read status (similar to WhatsApp).

It would be nice if you could select your preference for each group your participating in (or even have the chat admin have the selection).

I’d personally like them turned off in my individual chat but I’d really like if it showed which members read the message in certain group chats. Having 2 ticks (message viewed) doesn't hurt your privacy at all, IMO Agree, I also want to see the same feature like what's app. I don't want people to know if I have actually read the message or not.   


Please enable this function telegram. Oh I didn't know 2 checks meant read, I thought it was received just like WhatsApp. I should realized when I was digging through the themes parameters lol I just read the notifications and not open the chat. [deleted] Didn't know that. Thanks. The dp? What is dp? How new of a feature is that? My problem is that usually I exit the app while the chat is open, so switching to the app at all marks everything read When I do this, it selects the message for multi-select? It used to do the preview I seem to recall. Some people just don't want others to know if they read their messages or not, like whatsapp allows them to do.
It's a nice feature. Finally someone who understands what I'm trying to say. Thanks. I would love if this was a feature. I hate having to reply instantly. Profile image in the chat list - I don't know what DP stands for, but that's what he's referring to  
CC [u/roberdaniel](https://www.reddit.com/u/roberdaniel) Display picture. Display picture. That sounds like a personal problem. What I meant is long press on the dp,not other areas of the chat. Why so many downvotes? You clearly don't understand what I am saying. [deleted] Then don't? You're not obliged to reply to anyone. Thanks > My problem 

... that's literally what I said it is. Thanks for clearing that up. I tried both? For me, It just turns the display pic into a selected check to mute or archive the chat? It's okay, man. This is reddit. Take an orange from me I know what you mean

I also think this defeats the purpose of read receipts. If they can be disabled, they mean nothing. This does not remove the second checkmark. This only marks it as unread for your end. It doesn't bug me. Please read the original post.
And also, what you mention is only for one user to have a conversation marked as unread. It's not about replying. Sometimes people want instant reply and mind if we don't reply instantly after reading.

With the feature we are asking here, we can easily handle the situation. I want a peach Thanks <3 I really needed that vitamin C Yes, that's the point. Like it works on whatsapp.
People decide if they want it enabled or not. Thrn tap and hold the profile picture to preview the chat without marking it as read. No thanks

I use telegram for work and knowing when someone sees something is extremely useful and also less annoying Are you sure in that case the other party will see 1tick mark? Good for you. Here, have a medal 🎖 Yes.

Previewing the Chat (from notifications tray or the in-app preview functionality) does NOT add a second ""read"" mark.

Edit to add: While in Telegram Android you cannot scroll the preview chat and are stuck at the first few unreads (that bar that is at the top with ""New unread messages ⬇""), with Telegram X you can preview the chat and even scroll through it. No need to be patronizing. Your opinion is not the only valid one, asshat. I mainly use it from windows pc, but in windows telegram there is no such option. Only can do it from the android app. Solved the problems partially, but it think telegram can also add this function in settings to page like what's app. > No thanks

""No thanks"" what then? Nobody is asking for your opinion if you like the feature I'm talking about or not. 

My original question was about if the feature will be able on telegram or if there is any way to disable it. But you are talking about that you don't want the feature because you use telegram for work and whatever... Nobody cares. You're requesting a feature that doesn't exist. You're making arguments in favor of the feature. Expect arguments against said feature request.

""""Nobody cares"""" about your request. Lovely community"

Can we get proper Android Emoji support for Telegram on Android?;30;iypes1;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/iypes1/can_we_get_proper_android_emoji_support_for/;9;"Does this bother anyone else? I use Telegram X to get around it... but the version is clearly behind in a bunch of different ways. I'd rather use the main client, but the iOS emoji are so... jarring and ugly. 

I assume their reasoning is the animated emoji thing but... that seems like a daft reason to remove the option entirely? I mean... I've got an Android phone, most of my friends I chat to do as well, so why not let use our native emoji? Anyone know how we might go about getting this feature added?";2020-09-24 06:24:32;"It's the same reason why Twitter made their own emoji, Android OEMs are so incredibly fucking slow sometimes that it's just easier to implement your own, so you can have them up to date and make sure everyone is looking at the same emoji. Looking at you Samsung. Personally I like the iOS Emojis the most xD

I even installed them as a font on my huawei :') I thought the same, but I actually started liking them since I switched to iOS, I don’t know why. Didn’t even need to replace them with anything else I use Telegram from F-Droid. Emojis look great there: https://f-droid.org/packages/org.telegram.messenger Imagine wasting your time bitching about fucking EMOJIS on reddit. Real priority lol You could at least allow the users to choose between different emoji packs (maybe even with the option to create/modify your own and import it into the app), which is what Telegram X does. It's not dependent on the OS-provided set, but ones that are downloaded within the app. Maybe let us choose the latest available Android emoji? Or copy Telegram desktop in how you can choose the emoji pack. I mean, Samsung deserves to be called out for its past, but right now it's one of the best in providing support and updates, at least on their mid-to-high-end phones."

Trouble is, whatever the actual text contains - links or whatever, could be used for phishing. So if you go there and see links embedded in the text - don't click on them. Also, as a rule of thumb - crap that says you'll see adult content, meet hot girls in your area or similar stuff is always phishing or trojans. It's the oldest trick in the book.

Just use a Web browser, there are millions of stuffs there, why bother to have it in the chat? time to switch to Android master race - from my iPad [deleted] No, Telegram does, but only the iOS client respects the setting, and also cannot disable it. If there setting is disabled, the iOS version can browse NSFW channels. No one has been able to find me an NSFW channel I can't browse on my iPhone. Ios is stubborn Ich sehe das nicht als gute Idee Why is this an issue with Telegram specifically and not, say, 3rd party reddit apps? I use Android, and Google cracked down on 3rd party reddit apps for ""allowing adult content"" (even though they're just clients to view reddit). The solution was to add a toggle for NSFW content that was disabled by default; the user has to enable it themselves.

I mean, what about other stuff like Discord? Does it not allow NSFW channels/servers on the iOS app? no，telegram doesnt block nsfw，Apple store does Agree on this!
And happy cake day! Because its now server side it has possed a issue The issue is the same with Reddit, actually. With Reddit you have to enable NSFW content on the site. Third party app developers are not allowed to write in the toggle, it has to be done outside their app.

No idea about Discord, I'd imagine either the rule is the same or Apple doesn't care about Discord (or not enough Karen's have complained about it). Oh no 4 years on reddit ;v but thanks My first year!! Exactly, why don't IOS block all from browser too?"

I think it's enough. Why not? The most common (and, I think, the most desired) way to ""secure"" your bot is to filter IDs of people messaging your bot. Or, if you want limited, but dynamic access, you can make your own authentication like sending bot some pre-shared (or shared elsewhere) password to be added to whitelist (you need to maitain this whitelist yourself on your own server/host).

Regarding deleting messages, please refer to the official Bot API documentation: [https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#deletemessage](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#deletemessage) [deleted] you can check not only by chat_id but also by other parameters.  for example user name.  and return an answer only if both parameters match.  You can view these parameters here @ShowJsonBot [deleted] I think for users always the same. Maybe for groups and bots are different. Sorry for my English"

"Does the search function that's built into Telegram use some smart algorithm to check for names?

It's a simple match based search. Is that a fact or do you believe that to be the case? It's a fact based on using telegram for years. It's also based on the numerous times my wife and I search our chat history to find a link or some other important info one of us shared with the other. See, the thing is: I searched for ""Gregor"" and the search showed me a match for ""Gysi"". Gregor Gysi is a German politician. That made me think that there might be some algorithm behind it. “gregor” was in the same message as “gysi” most likely Whatever you found had both names in it. I highly doubt that it ""knew"" that the last name was gysi and showed you matches based on that. See, that's why I asked. It might've been in the link that was in the same message but I was confused because it highlighted ""Gysi"". But thanks a lot for the answer!"

It can prevent messages from being revoked.

Don't you think it's a hack or abuse, and basically destroy Telegram's original ""delete msg"" feature, causing potential privacy issue? Not to mention that external script and code shouldn't be able to manipulate telegram chats in the first place, otherwise it's too insecure.

What do you think guys? Does the Telegram official know about the ""plugin""?

---

Edit - 7 hours after posting: 

It feels like some guys aren't getting the point.

It's as if they really think OP doesn't even know taking picture exists, screenshot exists, export or forward msg exists, and think ""OP doesn't even know the simple truth that how can he be sure something is deleted on a device that is not his?, so idiot hahaha...downvote."" yet they probably didn't understand what this post is discussing yet...too quick judge, too unwilling listen (think in fact).

Let's say you're Reggie Brown, and when you go to Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy with the idea of a disappearing pictures mobile app, and they both laugh at you about how you dare to imagine being able to delete a picture on a device that is not yours? How silly idea it is. (just like what happened in this post). then Snapchat doesn't exist now.

The point of discussion here is not whether we can erase info on other device in the eventual sense, but rather that any company has to guarantee the integrity of feature it promised (and if it's not possible from technical reason, they should perform informing obligation).

Why did Snapchat develop the feature ""alert others when you take a screenshot""? How silly those Stanford guys are! Doesn't they know I can take pictures with another phone? If they know, why develop screenshot notification feature at all? They wouldn't be able to stop me anyway haha! - The point is: Just because it's ultimately unblockable doesn't mean Snapchat don't need to work towards ""integrity of feature"". ""Picture Disappear"" is a promised feature of Snapchat, so even if picture already sent is ultimately impossible to disappear, they still need to overspend their efforts as much as possible to increase the cost of cracking this feature.

It's similar situation with games and plugins, although fog of war is definitely removable eventually, because once the data code is in the gamer's device, gamer's device must be able to access it. But why do game companies repeatedly crack down plugins of removing fog of war? Because fog of war is a promised feature!

""Deleting msg"" feature is one that Telegram promised, written on the official website, with ON/OFF switch in software seems 100% working once user click ON, so Telegram should try to make it also close to 100% working if user click ON, just like Snapchat developed screenshot alerts (in the version of Snapchat in my country, they even disabled screenshot directly. We can't take screenshots unless we root or jailbreak the phone). It's too exhausting and already waste 1 hour to clarify self in a foreign language, so if some guys still can't understand what's being discussed here, Sorry.

As I write these words, DonDino1's reply is stepped on the most bottom with -3 downvotes, but it's only his reply that actually understands the topic of this post and answers to the point without off-topic. **Telegram Official indeed can do nothing. The reason is Telegram's client is open source. Telegram official has no control over what the client does. If Telegram client is closed source and this plugin is so widely used that has threatened the normal use of this feature by most users, then Telegram should and definitely will add sth. like anticheats/protection code against such plugins that destroy its own feature (as game companies do, as Snapchat does)**. In fact Tencent is already doing this to WeChat (which also has revoke feature and faces anti-revoke plugins and closed source). It should be obvious for anyone with a base knowledge of informatics: how can you be sure that something is deleted on a device that is not yours? 

You can't, with any system, you can't with Telegram nor you can with WhatsApp or any platform that claims to do that. In the end if you think about it one could simply make a screenshot, or even if you protect from screenshots, take a photo with another device. 

In the end if something is received by someone you must assume that information can be read and saved somehow. 

Deleting is just something that is good to save you from embarassing mistakes in 99% of cases (like I accidentally send a dick picture to my boss instead of my girlfriend), but not to protect sensitive information. If the other party wants to keep everything it can. Telegram can do nothing about this. It not a different client that uses its own credentials to access the API that Telegram could block - it's a local modification to the official client. I would say though if you are worried about the possibility that deleted messages can still be kept by another party, they can forward them to saved messages anyway and from there on to whoever they please even after you have deleted for both sides. Haha I have no idea why my comment was down voted. Do Telegram fans not want people to know these things can happen? Very weird. You're talking about ""delete info"" in broader sense. this thread is talking about specific ""revoke feature"". different level different subject. letting screenshots involved cancel the whole point of discussion.

Scenario: If I'm flirting with gf, but accidentally send words to boss, and immediately realize it, so revoke within 1 second, since I see he's talking to others another side office, doesn't notice message, so I would be 100% confident he would never see that embarassing words before. But not now, If this plugin is installed on his side, every text AUTO saved. He can check anytime later. and this ""Not Guaranteed"" should have been communicated to users long ago.

Upvote has said everything, so there's no need for further debate. I understand your view and your view dominates. You can do that without any plugin in a multitude of ways, like having something on your phone that logs push notification content (and thus messages that then get deleted), ore use the Telegram CLI client to save everything on a log file on a server of your property, use something that constantly watches the local Telegram database on your phone and backs it up on changes, or have an application that records the screen of the active Telegram window, have a packet capture between the Telegram app and the Telegram server, you name it. 

If something reaches the other person phone there is nothing that Telegram can do to guarantee that the information gets deleted. The only case of course is if the other person phone has not yet received the notification, for example because it was offline at the moment (but even then, I'm not sure because for how push notification work if the notification was sent they maybe still receive the push notification for a moment for then the app make it disappear immediately, but a push notification logging tool can still capture it...)

No protection implemented client-side, like the possibility to delete messages, can be effective. Sure, it can be effective if you assume that the other person is honest and doesn't try to break the protocol, but if the other person is not and wants to break the protocol, there is nothing you can do about it to even detect that the other person did break the protocol. Thank you for info, you're absolutely right, and the fact that you're teaching me here is exactly what I'm saying about: this should have been told to users officially, not a year later (after my privacy already probably leaked), not by a reddit user. well, maybe base knowledge of informatics Im lack of."

[Discussion] Did Telegram change the way it handles uploaded file names?;22;iveb4y;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/iveb4y/discussion_did_telegram_change_the_way_it_handles/;3;"Until yesterday, when I uploaded a file in a chat, it's name wouldn't be modified. Today I noticed instead that spaces and punctuation marks are being converted into low lines (i.e. ""\_""). I've tried it on Windows, Linux and Android with the same file and its name always changes. Does anybody know why?";2020-09-18 23:50:40;"It does that when file names get too long. The limit is somewhere around 50. I think all spaces and dots are changed into ""\_"". Not sure why it does this though. It's probably two different algorithms handling it. My guess is there's one that just copies the filename and pastes it as is in the metadata, but if it's longer than the limit, it's handed to a name changing algorithm and the developer must have also included a name standardizer in the name changing algo. So if it doesn't need changing, nothing happens, and if it does, it applies all the name changing functions including that.

Another theory is that it could be to stop people from trying to use filenames as extra storage beyond the limit (you can store binary files in zeroed and ones given enough space), but it given that it's already limited to 50 chars this one doesn't make much sense. I see... Yesterday I tried only with a long-named file (83 characters) I've never uploaded before and Telegram changed it, today with a short-named one (13 characters) and it didn't change. I've read the metadata of both files with a simple bot and indeed the name is changed when it surpasses a certain number of characters.

Nice, now I'll remember to add a name-changing algorithm to my bots. Thank you both!"

Windows app crashes since late August;4;iv68x6;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/iv68x6/windows_app_crashes_since_late_august/;3;"Hi. Please help me debug Telegram app crashes. I've used it for two years now and it was always an example of super stable and fast chat client. And about a month ago it started silently crashing, meaning I don't see any message or other visual symptom and app is not running suddenly. Usually I see that phone is raising notification and desktop app is gone.  

I'm using official and fully updated Win 10 Home on the desktop, and some enterprise flavor of Win 10 Pro on the laptop (it is older in version due to enterprise but also fully updated). No junk, cracks and stuff. Antivirus running (same as during those two stable years).  

Please advise what can I do about it, or at least how to get more information from the app? I waited for a month for it to resolve by itself and starts to be really annoying now.";2020-09-18 16:39:29;"Try portable version. It might have something to do with Windows killing apps that take up too much operating power, perhaps? Telegram can get pretty up there if you let it run for a while and download files, watch a lot of picture-filled channels, etc.

I don't think reinstalling is the first thing you should try, maybe give the portable or web versions a shot first and check if the version you're using is up-to-date, maybe it stopped updating for some reason? tried reinstalling?"

Why do random accounts join our telegram group and not talk;26;iuiu19;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/iuiu19/why_do_random_accounts_join_our_telegram_group/;18;"Disclaimer : I am not an admin, and can't do anything to block them. But I am just wondering what's the point? The accounts are obviously bots or something (and i don't mean telegram bots).

The usual spammers who talk when they join or something I get it, they try to ask for money or something. But the ones that don't talk, WHY? What are they? What do they gain by entering?";2020-09-17 15:52:41;"Sometimes there is no ""why"" for people actions.

Some just register to telegram for the first time and just start joining random groups, channels, etc, use the app for a few minutes and uninstall it right away. And there you have a random inactive user on your group.

Others just don't give a shit and leave those groups unread like many others.

Most people are just stupid and / or not organized, and don't care much about it. Some of them could be people who join so that they can see the other members on the group and then PM them. I once had someone try to teach me ""a smart way to invest"".

Of course, depending on the group, some of them might just be lurkers who prefer to silently observe I def am guilty of this. I find a group pertaining to an interest of mine, and then I'll never post cause I'm not a fan of talking to people but I enjoy reading about the shared interest. Don't think I've ever talked passed the introduction so people know I'm not a bot Haha. They aren't necessarily bots. I, for example, sometimes enter support groups, but instead of immediately posting my question, I do a group search to see if it was already answered. If I do find it, I just stay in the group because why not?

I also do it on some casual chat groups because I like seeing the memes/convos/anything going on, but I don't necessarily interact with them

I'm not a bot :) Maybe people nearby you(r group) location. There were a lot of chinese bot accounts when the Hong Kong protest were at its prime. I call some of them harvesters. They join telegram and don't post because they're fake accounts. They then grab a list of users and then that list is used to try to scam other users. At least that my conspiracy theory. This way if a user reports a user for being spam they can't be blocked from the group as you don't know really where they came from. The world will never know *shrug* I'm a reader, not a writer Fake spam accounts,in India they are carders promising expensive mobiles at ""cheap"" rates,provides you pay 1/4 of the price as upfront payment...via online money transfer.
Then there are so called""hackers"" offering cheap ""services.
Prostitution too works  same way , promising to ""chat nu*e"" just for you.
Click baits and password stealers and then links to download ""app"" to hack social media accounts with a shitty warning""deleting in 5 minutes and don't hack celebrity account""
I could go on and on it's a rabbit hole there. It happens on my LINE group too. Same with Telegram. It's hard to understand what people are thinking. I'd like to think that they are just busy with their life. Depends, probably twitter journalists looking for ""far right networks"" maybe they follow a large number of groups to see who is individually more gullible and likely to fall for a scam (as we know, many groups actively remove generic spam links, either by using a bot or by asking an admin, it doesn't really work so they 'evolved' their phishing / scamming techniques) I know for a fact that they are fake spam accounts *Depends, probably*

*Twitter journalists looking*

*For ""far right networks""*

Telegram made a new file extension, .tgs, specially for animated stickers.

When we you sent a .tgs file over Telegram, it would never be compressed by a file. Could be they saved the stickers as tgs and sent them like that?
(As opposed as sending them by clicking on a sticker pack) Yeah, but... It's a ""sometimes"" behavior. Because there are even more animated stickers sent in our chat, but those doesn't seem to appear at the files section. So I thought like... What she could be doing? Hmmm... I would guess it’s the app client. Maybe it’s Unigram, Telegram X and others getting confused and sets them as files.

When auto-night is turned on, it takes the ""light"" theme for the day from the settings above. But you can't edit those settings when night mode is enabled. So you have to disable the night mode first - change the theme - and then re-enable night mode.

I had a dark accent set as the regular theme as well, that's why I thought it didn't work. OK, glad to hear that you sorted it out. This comment explained why it wasn't working for me, I also had dark set as default by mistake :) Ha! And your comment made me very glad that I helped :)"

Edit: Also, you can set it to ""only my contacts can add me in groups"". [deleted] Block them? If you're good with programming you could program a userbot that fetches new incoming messages and if they're not from someone in your contacts, automatically bloxkay reports as spam and deletes their message. 
. Yeah but none of the things which you said above clears my doubt.

So whoever the person, if he shares a common group with me means, he can message me, right?
I can't change it at any cost, right? This is not true. If you do not set an username and your configuration is like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/gyeool/what_information_is_disclosed_to_others_in/ftcghqf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):

* Settings->Privacy and Security->Phone Number (Nobody), Last seen & online (My contacts), Forwarded messages (My contacts), Voice calls (My contacts), Groups (My contacts);
* Settings->Privacy and Security->Phone number->Who can see my phone number (My contacts), Who can find my phone number (My contacts);

No one except your contacts can message you. Oh okay. Thanks I can block them once they messaged me. But how can I know who's gonna message me? So blocking isn't an option. I'm not that level expert in coding. Yes, you can't change it. Though, you can change the settings to only allow your contacts to add you in groups. Else, anyone can message you. [deleted] I missed the part where you said not in your contacts... As far as I know that isn't possible. You're hoping to prevent spam messages? Hmm hmm... Right, but you are already sharing with them some information... Yeah. I'm in one group, there the scenario has arrived that everybody is messaging me. [deleted] Have you read the question?

Maybe you do not know how telegram works. You can avoid that an user not present in your contacts list to contact you as described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ittfy5/how_to_not_allow_a_user_who_isnt_in_my_contact_to/g5k3py7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Privacy settings about name and surname;13;itrbeu;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/itrbeu/privacy_settings_about_name_and_surname/;8;"Hi all, just a curiosity.

I'm actually registered on Telegram with my full name and surname, mobile number and username.

I know about the privacy relating to the number and username, but what about name and surname?

Username is public and it is written everywhere (FAQ, Telegram guides...). Name is public too, I think, since i see everyone's name in the groups I joined.

But the surname? How it works? In the FAQ and generally looking on the Net I can't find anything.";2020-09-16 10:55:08;"If you have written your full name in the name box in the settings, then it is public. As has already been explained, both Name fields are public. Surname is entirely optional, you can leave it blank if you want to.

It might be useful to know that people who saved you as a contact will see the name they gave your contact, not the name you set in Telegram.

So if you don't want others to know your surname just remove it :) Is there a way if only username can be used as public and hide real name? When I open the ""name"" box I find two fields, name and surname. Only name is public? Nope No. Both are public. Even the surname. 

Btw, Happy Cake Day! Thanks! :)"

Don't check to see if the group was taken down or not.

Consider this though: if Telegram is hosting CP via a group/channel, they have plausible deniability if no one reported it. However, if anyone has reported it, said deniability goes straight out the window. Hence, they have a solid motivation to act on your report.

You could also report it to the FBI (assuming you're American... not sure if you have to be, though), but you don't want them knowing who YOU are and asking you why you were in said group to start with. Better to not associate yourself with the issue."
Why can I delete messages from the other Person in a personal Chat?;4;it7icj;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/it7icj/why_can_i_delete_messages_from_the_other_person/;13;"As the TItel says, everyone can delete messages other persons send you personally. So you could say, I never got you message and the other person doen't even sees that a message was delete or gets a notification.. 

Does somebody know why this is?";2020-09-15 15:11:30;"Some privacy concern. I guess that way you have control of the entire conversation. IDK, I don't find it right either, that way your massage can be taken WAAAAAY out of context That's why I don't write my business messages on Telegram, but on WhatsApp. No accountability at all. If you’re afraid that your messages can be taken way out of context, you shouldn’t be chatting with that person in the first place. On telegram desktop there is [export feature](https://telegram.org/blog/export-and-more). Telegram is made for the people, not for the business. Yeah, I mean, that's something I wouldn't suffer from with my friends and family. 

The only thing related that happened to me was that a close friend was constantly deleting GIFs of cute cats I was sending like crazy because he doesn't like cats. Haha. 

Other than that... I think you can because it wouldn't have ""sense"" to be able to delete the entire conversation but you can't delete individuals? 

At first I honestly was against it, but then you think about it... It feels like you have some kind of control of what you do on the Internet, at least on a messaging app. What if a girl is regretting sending the you know what kind of photos but it has to trust the guy to do the right thing? 

It doesn't have to be necessarily good, you know, it could be used for evil. But if you know the people you're talking with, then you don't even have to worry about it. It's the same for people to people interaction. No accountability and prone to tampering.

And how the fuck does that export feature function when it's been deleted? It is totally okay if you can delete your own messages. If you for example send a Photo you didn't want to send. But why would you need to delete a message somebody send you with out a notification to the other person? Telegram is focused on privacy not on business. Export works before deleting the messages. Think about in countries where there's more government surveillance or anti-democracy movements like Hong Kong. If your friend gets taken, you could delete messages from their phone before they get in trouble and potentially lead to many more users, and a ""deleted messages"" mark would be more incriminating. Before. Lol.

> Telegram is focused on privacy 

So are WhatsApp, Signal and the others. Fanboi and their pathetic excuse duh. If your purpose is to use telegram as business service and your preoccupation is that your interlocutors could delete the chat, you can do a backup on daily basis or ask yourself how fair they are.

No whatsapp is all, but not private. > No whatsapp is all, but not private.

The fuck does this mean? English oi."

Can I turn them off? I know my volume management is a tragedy but I don't need to reminded of it every few hours 😂 I use CleanMyMac to manage space and a bunch of other critical stuff. I don't often praise software, but it is very good at what it does. Running out of disk space is a LOT more annoying than frequent notifications. You can decrease telegram cache storage. On telegram desktop: Settings→Advanced → 			Manage local storage. Total size limit: 1 GB. Maybe a good time to upgrade to an SSD And go through the whole fever dream of setting up a hackintosh laptop? 

no Idk if you can turn them off but you could free up some space haha. But otherwise, check temporary files and stuff you might not need. >I know my volume management is a tragedy but I don't need to reminded of it every few hours 😂

Clear some space, seriously. The warning isn't a joke. CleanMyMac helped. I now have 9 gigs free instead of 4. Thanks, man! On a Mac, it's settings > data and storage > storage use slider. It doesn't go below 5 gb

thanks for not telling to clean my drive like the rest of the thread 😂 You can just use a HDD dock to clone one drive to the other, bung it back in and you're gtg  *The warning isn't a joke.* 

lol, what worse can happen? it **IS** a joke when you have something needs to be done yet above annoys you. Are you using telegram desktop or mac version? >lol, what worse can happen?

It can slow down your system, cause further errors, prevent you from properly updating, and reduce the lifespan of the disk. Considering your attitude, you'd be the guy crying here because you didn't back up your system and your drive died a violent death. 

It costs almost nothing to get a 32GB flash drive to dump some shit, and it gets rid of the error. What are the DRASTIC errors that may creep up due to low storage if I may ask? Did you not read the rest of the comment?

EDIT: In the time we've been arguing, you could have cleared your temp files, uninstalled some programs, and moved your pictures into a spare flash drive. Which, by the way, is enough to clear the error. It'll be terribly devastating stuff like some apps crashing or not lanching. Spooky! Before being a dick, maybe check who's asking next time ;) Oh, I know who's asking. They're also being an idiot. 

OP or no, Itachi is a dumbass. Anybody who says, *low disk space warning isn't a joke!* is a dumbass lol. [citation needed]"
Bypass telegram account-limit with throw-away-number and copying tdata?;0;isp100;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/isp100/bypass_telegram_accountlimit_with_throwawaynumber/;4;"Since telegram limits users to having one account per phone number, and requires a phone number for creating an account, I was wondering whether there are ways to bypass this limitation by creating (and keeping) an account without owning a phone number. My idea was something along the lines of

1. Creating a telegram account with a throw-away-number, for example from Burner

2. Setting the account to two-factor-authentication, so whoever gets the number can't get access to the account with it

3. Copying the tdata directory from one laptop to another if one ever wants to transfer ones account, since the intended way (requesting a new code) won't work without the phone number.

Am I missing something cruicial here? Will a person who gets the used number be able to gain access to the account or delete it even after I activate two-factor-authentication? Would there be any risk of loosing my account even if I keep a backup of the tdata folder (which should contain everything that's needed for a telegram client to authenticate with the telegram server)?

I have a quick question about the telegram cache storage.;25;isdyyt;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/isdyyt/i_have_a_quick_question_about_the_telegram_cache/;23;So i noticed TG was taking up 80gb of storage on my iphone so i decided to clear the cache since it’s been awhile. I click on clear cache and i notice that photos, videos and files are only taking up 8gb all together but the fourth section “other” is taking up 72gb. I have no idea what that is and why it’s taking up so much storage. Does anyone know what that is or care to explain it to me?;2020-09-14 07:27:10;"It seems to include small files, stickers, images in low quality (first the image is downloaded in low quality, then it is downloaded in high quality, I do not know why it works like this), and also takes up the loading of sites. Do not be afraid for your files, they are not deleted forever on your account, they are stored in the cloud and you can download them later. 
P.S. Sorry for my bad English, i write it from Google Translate :D Question. Do iPhones have ways to clear cached data in apps like Android? Those are files, stickers and operating data cache that have been sitting there for a long time.

I usually do a regular cache cleanup of my Telegram on a monthly basis. It’s perfectly harmless and can be removed. Just think of it as cleaning your room. [photo](https://imgur.com/a/7PowfY6) of what im talking about. Had the same with 10gb. Dont know what it was... i just deleted it and it made no difference... except more storage ( also on iphone) mine is like photos videos documents music and other files... there is no others? i think you haven't disabled auto media download. It automatically download images videos files smaller than a pre determined size in settings. As others mentioned stickers and such don’t forget it’s also the database that holds these and all your chats, channels and groups sent/received texts I set telegram to keep media only for 1 week , and constantly clear the cache of the app on iOS from inside Telegram's settings page..
Even if it's not kept locally on the device, it's still in the cloud and can be loaded again without issues.
Also, you can set the maximum cache of telegram from the same place
Can also recommend that you delete sticker sets that you no longer use could the “other” section be the stuff on your phone? No worries. Thank you this helped me understand. No, either the app offers a way, like Telegram in the in-app settings, or you have to remove and reinstall it. Thank you for the information. I think im going to need to do monthly cleanups aswell lol. Can’t believe TG was taking up so much space with useless stuff. Yeah i didnt know what it was either when i deleted it but what i did know is that i got 70 gb of storage freed up. I didn’t, i don’t want to open the app and have to wait for stuff to download but that’s not what was taking up my space. Images and videos only took up about 8gb. The “other” stuff was taking up 72gb. Thanks👍🏻👍🏻 No. It’s when you clear the cache in the TG app not in the settings of the phone itself. When you go into the TG app and go to storage then to clear telegram cache it has 4 sections. Videos, photos, files and then other. Should be noted that iOS clears caches when needed by itself, mostly (tg seems to stuck to its settings tho) It shows that some data are being kept on your phone and not being uploaded to Telegram, therefore giving you more power and freedom over the privacy of your data. Other than images, videos there is audios,caches,documents(files). does the “other” disappear when you clear TG’s cache in-app? Yeah it disappears once i clear that section ""Other"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
Archived chats not hidden anymore;0;isd81o;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/isd81o/archived_chats_not_hidden_anymore/;4;"Seems like about every third update the Archived Chats stop being hidden by the pull down.

Why the heck would they keep breaking this?";2020-09-14 06:36:22;"What do you mean? The ""archived chats"" item in your chats list is not hidden anymore? It no longer needs dragging down from the top to show the Archived chats. They are visible immediately upon opening the app. Swipe to the left (or hold on it if you're using folders). It will hide it from the top and it will appear only when you pull down Thanks, that did it. I was positive that happened by default.

Telegram on Android - are both versions still in development?;15;is0qil;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/is0qil/telegram_on_android_are_both_versions_still_in/;12;"Hello everyone :)

Telegram X on iOS was merged with Telegram and only the latter is available on AppStore. But what about Android? Both versions are readily available in Google Play store but only ""default"" Telegram client stays updated (X got its last update on 15th May 2020, ""default"" one on 21st August 2020).  


Which one is safer to use? Will there be any further development on Telegram X?  


TIA for replies and have a nice day y'all :)";2020-09-13 18:55:33;"I switched to normal Telegram on Android because it was getting features faster (folders etc). I don't see much difference between them now anyway. Both are safe and both will have further development, the only difference is that Telegram X uses a different library (TDLib) which is kinda faster and liter, but gets updated a little slower than the default one It's definitely still being updated, just slower. Probably becase it seems to be done by just one guy and he's working with a totally different build that he made from the ground up. I think X is definitely faster and has some cool features like being able to start a video message with your back camera by default but I prefer the regular version's design by far. Safer by what criteria? I prefer stable functionalities so I use the normal Telegram. Despite the claims that the X is smoother with animations, that's not the case for me so it's pretty jarring when using the app. Telegram X isn't a fully open source client.. I think both is still updated but slower on the X. Telegram X is able to show the time when a forwarded messages is created, which for me is useful to know whether it was the old information being recycled. 

Other than video calls, folders, what else does Telegram App (not X) offers that's not in Telegram X? personally i like using telegram x, as you can see the date and time of forwarded messages and other cool features such as setting your profile picture visibility to ""nobody"" and seeing an overview of the messages someone sends in a group with just like two clicks, but there are also some downsides like the slower updates, and you cant set your profile picture to the desired position (so i use the normal telegram for this, lol) but overall depends on your preferences/needs. I prefer Telegram X, but it seems to crash a lot when making calls. Meanwhile you can't change the emojis used on the normal telegram versions, and the substratum overlay what l that you used to be able to use for that is also no longer working... I have IOS n the profile picture is getting little weird it put aside the pictures whenever i try to set new one. Yeah I don't like the trade off, but so far I can manage to sacrifice performance than getting slower feature updates. Communications safety. some minor feature like find nearby users, I only use X so not very sure."

I took the chance one time facebook, instagram and whatsapp were down, to make my family get telegram as a backup messaging system independent from facebook, and created the family group on telegram.

Then, I created the alternative versions of the same whatsapp groups I have (gamers, music band, work, etc), on Telegram and started inviting them. A few checked the app and liked it, and in a few weeks everyone is on telegram now.

I barely use whatsapp lately. Just try that, create the same groups. And send them the link to install it from the app store.

Everyone who tries it, ends up loving it.

That's true. Here in India Telegram is getting quite popular because people use it as a source to download pirated movies.

I built Telereddit, a Telegram bot which lets you easily see shared Reddit posts previews directly in the group chat. This bot will also automatically send a random post from a subreddit when you name it.

Github: [https://github.com/fabiosangregorio/telereddit](https://github.com/fabiosangregorio/telereddit)

Add this bot: [https://telegram.me/tele\_reddit\_bot](https://telegram.me/tele_reddit_bot)

Some suggestions to consider - 

1. Allow people to add it as an admin and give it the ability to delete the link and preview that caused it to activate and post - so as to make it look nicer with less spam in the chat

2. Show the upvotes and comments - the basic analytics numbers at the bottom of the post - relevant to whether somebody’s just sharing or sharing something that might be really interesting based on how popular it already is 

Thanks for a great bot Awesome thanks dude 😎 Oh wow, thank you so much! Makes sharing much easier, previously I'd just copy the link to the GIF itself so it loaded in the app. Thank you very much for the appreciation! It should be up, are you having issues with it? Thank you very much for the great suggestions! Thank you for the love! Thank you very much! Getting the right media url from reddit is a bit of a pain but it works most of the time :) I added it to my group straight away, it works SO well and is incredibly useful. great bot!"

Whenever I interact with the telegram window, I always inadvertently bring out the emoji flyout which covers most of my chat window.

There should be an option to disable the flyout on mouseover so I actually have to click on it to open the flyout.

Even if you want the flyout, the [actual size of the button](https://i.imgur.com/fjjMx7c.png) is much larger than the button's icon which also is annoying.";2020-09-11 21:04:39;There's no way to disable it (or I don't know any), but as a workaround, you can click on the button and open the emoji sidebar, so that it always stay there and don't pop-up every time

With one contact/group? More than one?

Did the group/contact nuke the convo?

This is why it’s important to read the fine print.;175;iqqn2l;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/hdn07nqxuim51.jpg;23;;2020-09-11 16:38:29;"i don't understand why this is posted here and not in the whatsapp sub?  are you saying telegram is better than whatsapp because of this arbitration clause?  if so, what is the comparable section in telegram's eula? Uh okay? Arbitration clauses are not rare, probably most of the EULAs you agree to nowadays have them. Lots of people happily sign up for forced arbitration without realizing what they're doing.

Mandatory binding arbitration is you voluntarily giving up your right to sue in court. It doesn't mean ""you can sue as long as it's not a class action"" or ""you can't sue unless they do something really bad"" or ""you can't sue unless they break the law"", it means ""you can't sue, even if they rip you off or willingly break the law"".

In arbitration, you'll go before an arbitrator (who is usually a lawyer) hired by Whatsapp. The arbitrator's decision is final and can not be appealed. The arbitrator does not have to base their ruling in law; they can decide you lose because it's almost lunchtime. The arbitrator does not have to follow caselaw; they can rule differently on two identical cases.

The arbitrator is paid for by Whatsapp and wants to earn repeat business. The arbitrator has broad leeway to assign whatever damages and fees they see fit -- including assessing you in full for all arbitration fees.

Companies love to screech about how wonderful arbitration is. But if it's so wonderful, why force customers to use it? Why not let the consumer decide?

EDIT: In the US, see Burton v. 24 Hour Fitness USA, Butcher v. Bally Total Fitness Corp, Baier v. Darden Restaurants et al, Simpson v. Pep Boys, Circuit City v. Adams, AT&T v. Concepcion, DirecTV v. Imburgia, Wyndham Vacation Resorts v. Garcia, American Express v. Italian Colors, and the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925. Arbitration can be a useful tool, but only when there's accountability and an appeals process. Those terms of service are WhatApp's, not Telegram's. Did you post on the wrong sub? That means nothing. I can still sue them if I wanted to (if I lived in the US that is). They can put anything in EULAs, doesn't mean it's lawful or that it will be upheld in court. Illusions of freedom for you The funny part is USA use to export their democracy Lots of companies sell their customer data to anyone and everyone. That doesn't make it right either. Yeah, but waiving your right to participate in class action lawsuits? I've never seen anything like that. A clause like that would be void in EU jurisdiction. Is this a quirk of North American law? I hope nothing like that exists in Europe. There's generally better data and consumer protection laws here. USA is not,nor ever has been a  Democracy,not possible to export what you don't have Yes, that's what individual arbitration is... AFAIK: by using Windows 10 you're doing the same. As well as Steam and most other online services That's what attribution means I know that the UK has a more common-sense approach to arbitration. UK courts can overrule and even remove arbitrators under certain circumstances. I'm not sure about the rest of Europe, but I believe it's nowhere near as lopsided as it is here in the US. IANAL, but from shallow research and things I think I might have read years ago, arbitration clauses are not valid in terms and conditions for a consumer (but are apparently relatively common between businesses). They are valid within contracts. However, [one side cannot dictate the arbitrator in the terms and conditions](https://www.hk24.de/produktmarken/beratung-service/recht-und-steuern/schiedsspruchsammlung/schiedssprueche/urteile/zustaendigkeit-des-schiedsgerichts/a1-nr153-1173512), the other party has a right to name a different arbitrator.

Edit: After slightly more research, in Germany, arbitration clauses with consumers are only valid when they are in their own contract, seperately signed. They can never be part of general terms and conditions. ([§ 1031 ZPO, sec. 5](https://dejure.org/gesetze/ZPO/1031.html)) A clause like that (mandatory binding arbitration with an arbitrator selected by WhatsApp) would be void in the EU because it violates the E.U. Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts (or the national laws based on that directive). Arbitration certainly exists in Europe. >arbitration clauses are not valid in terms and conditions for a consumer  (but are apparently relatively common between businesses) 

Just to clarify for people reading this in the future: you're talking about Europe. That's a great answer thanks. I feel lucky to be better protected in the EU. That wasn't the question. It's more whether user licence agreements for consumer software or apps are allowed to require you to waive your rights to take them to court. Specifically about Germany, but laws in other European countries may be similar."

Me: Gone, reduced to atoms. Yes, but can you stop someone from screenshotting the message before you edit it? My favourite App...God knows why some people still use FB ,WA and the likes...for messaging? TMR: Telegram Master Race Group video call ?? 

Telegram: edited the message 😭 WhatsApp people be like  I wish whatsapp have that function I wish this feature didn't exist. I've gotten upset with someone and deleted entire months of chats a couple times, but now I regret it. and that's why i don't use it anymore

EDIT: ignore this comment, i misread the pic

EDIT 2: ok I was referring to the title which states ""delete"" : i confirm my complaint : the fact that one can delete YOUR messages sucks and is the reason why i stopped using telegram. Well played! Even Though Even forwarding it works My version has a function to stop ""private chats""🙃 Telegram still doesn't support group calls. How? You can clearly see it was edited. With the secret chats it's disabled (screenshot) Yet that's a revelation oh ""edit!"" sorry i misread ""delete"", which is something i hated XD. One week convo one sided ly gone, awful. Only for android it seems. IOS users can still screenshot You can't edit messages in secret chat Then I'll take a picture of that chat with my other mobile😂 Is it better to have annoying ""this message was deleted""?

When I use delete its mostly to rephrase/rewrite something, and edit if there are spelling errors or typos. It can be abused, but my friends aren't like that so I'm fine. It does say delete and I agree this is a bad feature. It notifies the other person if you do so! A few years from now: Telegram new feature use the front facing camera to detect if someone is trying to take a picture with another phone. 🤣

Nobodies: Yeah! Awesome, I feel safe now

People with real reasons: *hid the second phone behind a cardboard*
🤣🤣🤣

The circle of life

Although I have a plugin to prevent that screenshoting thing, it's infallible: TelegramJustDontSendPostSensitiveInfo.apk >It can be abused

you have better friends than me XD Yeah editing and deleting my own comments is fine. But I shouldn't be allowed to delete something you wrote and remove it from all devices. Or delete an entire chat. ohhh u r right the title says so, that's where i read it. Then I'll write all the chats with a pen and paper😂😂😂 That may be too OP, I agree."

I'm pretty sure she doesn't know what a pyramid scheme is either and thought it was something positive so she confirmed that it is one to get you to send money. I love to string them along until they send you a payment link, then forward their messages to @NoToScam and block + report as spam Everyone that comes with just a ""hello"" and literally nothing else into my DMs gets blocked instantly. Like, you want something from me, so start with what you need, not ""hello"" and leave everything up to me. I need your sticker pack lol. Whats the name of that sticker pack? This looks like cold open on The office. ""SHE""?! Wow
That's a looong phone THE ""yes it is"" IS KILLING ME You should have gotten their cashapp tag so you could report them to cashapp as well as telegram. This is probably what that very VERY random dude was trying to do with me several weeks ago whats that theme? and is it available for desktop Pretty sure I never got an unsolicited message on Telegram. My privacy settings are jacked sky high though, and I don't typically use groups. Sometimes I'll pop in and see what's shakin', and then leave if it doesn't interest me. She sent me video talking to someone on Instagram... Like that was going to reassure me lol If and this is a giant ass if, if she is actually paying some people out as money comes in, it is indeed a ponzi/pyramid. But your right, this reeks of someone who doesn't know how to actually run a ponzi and scam people properly so she is probably just ghosting after she receives funds. If I am not mistaken, cash app, venmo, etc are extremely hard if not impossible to reverse so if you send funds to a scammer or the wrong person those funds are gone. I'll try do a little phishing to reel her ass into the telegram authorities, thanks for teaching me something new! Really loving this new form of communication that isn't tracking your every move! oh cool thanks for this.  is it a bot? How does this work? I tried sending messages but there was no response. Can you help? Yeah it's a messenger service not tinder. I like stringing people along like they have a chance... But I have to block atleast 1 account on Instagram that's just spam every day. Sending shit like ""❤️"" ""🌸"" or ""Hi"" as single message is an instant block and report i know, right? He uses “Resistance Dog”:

https://tlgrm.eu/stickers/ResistanceDog Hard to believe shrek is living in the real world! A bunch of phones let you scroll your Screenshots to get pictures of the whole context like this. nah, it's an account run by Telegram employees. forward them the messages of the user asking you for money, along with a screenshot of their profile and their user ID (if you can grab it). they should respond pretty quickly My telegram block list is ~~like 250+~~ 298 people. Mostly because of people who PM with just ""hello"" and literally nothing else, but also a LOT of people from support chats. Like, they join and just PK and admin about their issues instead of asking the over 4k people in the group that could help just as well... That's it https://i.imgur.com/Bvpt5A7.jpg I thought that I hadn't blocked anyone in my 6 years of using Telegram. Turns out I have blocked 2 music bots.. not sure why Some bots get blocked automatically WHY DO YOU HATE MUSIC?? 🤷🏼‍♀️😆 They get blocked when you tap ""Stop and block bot"".

I have a bunch of similar bots blocked because I've run `/start` on them once and now they spam me every couple of weeks with weird meme channels and the like with no way to opt-out. I report them for spam when they do that but I don't think anything has happened as a result. oh interesting! That could easily answer it!

"[Q] Telegram allows pressing ""enter"" while typing in channel info. But doesn't allow the same thing for the user's own bio! Is this intended? If so, I'm curious why?!!";17;iornjs;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/iornjs/q_telegram_allows_pressing_enter_while_typing_in/;16;[removed];2020-09-08 14:10:36;"I do wish the bio section had more space. Like, a lot more. Unfortunately yes. I don't the reasoning. Is there a reason behind this? When I press enter it just saves what I typed, instead of line breaks. Which is really bothersome.

What's the reason behind not allowing line breaks in biography? 👀 Go to their Twitter (@telegram) and request it in their latest post. I did that last time.

If they see there's enough of us, they'll change that. It's a very simple update for them . Just takes some voice and insisting.

Do you know how to do that? No it won't let you use line breaks. Unfortunately we have to cram everything together for now.

Oh come on this policy has to end. I'm fed up with goo.gl, shorte.st URLs in the bios of users I have to refer to.

⚠ONE FORGOTTEN TIP: Spammers fit spam in any given amount. Even 30 characters is enough to spam if someone wants to. This just made it a headache for normal users. And even a danger!
Currently everyone's bio is like: ""MORE INFO in shorte.st/blablah"". Hazard in daylight. And it's kinda sad that it seems legit to do that.

No, I don't like stories or fancy things. I hate spam. But this current state IS SPAM. Everyone is kinda under pressure to arrange everything in senseless ways so that things would FIT there. Bio in profile is limited to 70 characters, so people would put some basic info there and not any ads or spam (bc bio is always public and profiles are searchable) If you’re on desktop, enter also sends a message in chat, so what I do is I press shift + enter and it creates a new line. Hope that works for you in the bio! Ladies and gentlemen;
Our Brother(?) has nailed it.
May this precious moment live through history. 😇🏳 Bruh
How could one spam with a line break? No! Not all profiles are searchable! Only profiles with a username are.

Same goes with channels. Private channels don't appear in search results.
Whoever already had them, can see all the bio/info and the ones who don't, just can't. What do line breaks (enter key) have to do with spam? My question wasn't really towards char number.

But anyway lengthwise, most social apps offer more than 70. Take Reddit as example. linked in, Pinterest etc. How is spam being controlled in bios in all these places?

Besides, channels are not living users but they too, are usernames with infos. Why do they have such long info capacity then? Isn't there a worry that they might put spam there?

I think this worry is paradoxical and unnecessary. Around 90-100 'd more nicer. That'd be almost 3 more words. Too low limits, lead to harsh abbreviation and seeming vulgar. Nope, that doesn't create line breaks either. L

How many followers does the graph show on Sep 6th? What screen is this? I believe the larger number is how many people have over time joined, including people who have left same Maybe it's a projection? How much flowers to have this? Is this a group you have? Didn't know they counted metrics like this... I think it's like a prediction ""Followers"" != ""Total Followers"" the graph always shows like +30 of the actual number. And on September 6th it showed 1007 This is available for channel owners who manage large number of subscribers.
Can't remember the exact number, but these stats show up for your channel only once you reach a certain amount of subscribers iirc.

Edit: the magic number is 500 subscribers Yeah, that's likely the case. Sometimes people join a channel and leave several times in a short span, maybe it counts them as well. I don't think so. There are places in the graph where the value is decreasing. Which means that they are taking into account the ones that are leaving The dates would be wrong in that case 500 This is a channel statistic. The group stats look a bit different Well, it is somehow always wrong then ahah i see. the only other reason for that i see would be something like in this comment [https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/io69ld/anyone\_knows\_why\_growth\_shows\_more\_followers\_than/g4cetcq?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/io69ld/anyone_knows_why_growth_shows_more_followers_than/g4cetcq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Cool, thanks for the info! i think it’s showing that for the 6th to the 7th, people only joined and none left. but the count includes all people who joined, including the ones who left.

The ""Reset Chats"" button just resets the chats that are cached on your device and redownloads them, it doesn't affect your messages or history in any way. Thanks!

Deleted pics/vid showed up in app folder over a week after deleting them;2;inmffj;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/inmffj/deleted_picsvid_showed_up_in_app_folder_over_a/;7;I was checking out my app folders when I found these vids i sent someone a few weeks ago. I had just cleared cache on the tg settings directly before checking, and those vids were deleted from both sides over a week ago. One of the vids was actually deleted several months ago, maybe even last year. And they were sent with the expiring timer on them. I'm worried because they're on my phone now, I'm wondering if they could also still be on the phone of the other person who received them. Sort of makes the delete option useless right? Is this somehow a flaw on the app or is there a setting that I should change?;2020-09-06 16:58:04;"That's how the app works. It is called cache. You can clear it from settings or manually delete the folder. I don't know but maybe secret chats is different. TIP: if the pics are showing in your Gallery, you can hide them from apps by creating a folder named "".nomedia""  in the same directory you want to hide, it is an android thing that marks the folder not to be shown in media apps. Aah nope, i know about the cache. I cleared it up before checking the app folder (not referring to the gallery, I'm talking about the app folder in the internal storage, using file manager) i regularly clean up the cache because i do not have much space on my phone. Since the cache has been cleared, whatever pics, vids, voice recordings, etc should be gone right? But right after clearing the cache, i go back to internal storage and find vids that i deleted over a week ago, and a vid that was sent over a year ago. What's weirder is that the cache has been cleared several times (vids i watched were taking a lot of space so i clear it every 2-3 vids) and they were not there before. They suddenly reappeared. Which makes me think that they were still in the servers, or whatever it should be called, after i already deleted them from the app. This makes me wonder if TG has a copy of whatever shit i sent/received before even if it's no linger visible on my end.

*Sorry for the long explanation, hopefully you guys can tell me more about this😅😅😅 Actually yes Telegram has a copy of the vids after clearing the cache, every thing you send or receive is stored on the cloud and if you revisit that chat , all the media you scroll on will be downloaded (depending on your download settings) . So you may have cleared the cache so the data was gone, then reopened a chat so the files downloaded again. To completely clear delete the data from telegram you should delete the message containing the data it self or clear the chat as a whole. 
You can safely delete all telegram's data from your phone and delete the app itself and still have the data if you reinstall or use another phone. Yep, that's what i was saying, those vids were already deleted from the chat over a week ago. The messages are still there, but i deleted all pics/vids from the chat before clearing the cache. I deleted them from my end and on the receiver's side. They should be removed from the cloud as well right? Chat-deleted. Cache-cleared. But still the vids reappeared in the internal folder. That's really weird. I don't know but maybe something is off like maybe those are in saved messages or hidden somewhere you didn't see. Maybe you can try to use telegram on desktop to see if your media is there. I actually don't have this issue. Any media in the app are clearly visible in the app's folder untill cleared or deleted. 😞😞 it is weird and it's actually making me worry, like what else is still on the cloud that has not been deleted yet? Thanks for responding, i also sent a message to them about this, just in case they can explain it further or do something about it... Your cache is set to go back too far"

[discussion] Telegram's official designers channel (Telegram designers) is full of AMAZING concepts with high upvotes!! But how many of them are actually gonna come true??;149;ini0o6;Telegram;https://i.imgur.com/gFS40pF.jpg;38;;2020-09-06 10:38:51;"Cool you picked mine as well! Regarding to the question, I guess I heard something like them considering it if it’s likes make a certain percent of all traction plus if they find most people would find the feature useful. I don’t know, don’t remember and don’t really know if anyone besides people at Telegram know. Have any of the (people’s own) ideas got implemented (and in a way they designed it)? The reactions stuff has been rumored for a while and I think it was spotted on their beta versions and the Translation platform. Probably coming some time in the future! You can ""upvote"" on telegram? Genuine question. I know iMessanger has ""loved"" and stuff. I'd literally cry if Telegram got reactions Video rotation while video calling someone irritates me a lot. Can someone please find whats causing that.?? Unfortunately the iOS app sucks😞 Yeah yeah I was especially curious about yours!👌
I dig the reaction feature on Skype and I would kill (kidding) to have it on telegram and your renders were absolutely stunning!!!

About which ones have gotten implemented and which not, I'm not really sure.

 but I remember that people insisted a lot on getting a video call feature (on Twitter mostly) and they got it.

Now I'm just curious what features are coming next, and if these concepts are actually on the list.

✔✔If possible, Definitely ask them again if they are considering your reactions suggestion. Let us know here if u get a response.

You know what, it seems like it takes a little insisting from the users' side for them to be convinced to implement something. Yes! I've been waiting for the reactions for a while, nice to see them being added Really?? That's some great news, thank you. 😀

Do you know a source for this info that you could link to? Or maybe a screenshot etc that'd be nice. You can use @like to add these badges to any post anywhere.
It's an inline bot. I did the concept only because Telegram has reactions in alpha version and they suuuuuck. So just created it to see how could it actually look nice also in Telegram. Channels can add these ""votes"" with their posts Tears of joy or just normal tears?? 😂 How come? My point is all the concepts in the designers channel. That channel is full of concepts regarding all operating systems.

I'm not on iOS myself, it seems like these shots imply that I'm on iOS. What? Why do you think so? It's literally one of my favourite apps for iOS and iPadOS, along with Apollo. I'd really like reactions, but other than that, I love it. A really good ""iOS citizen"". Thanks man! I actually [updated it a little](https://i.imgur.com/EUsWxTF.jpg) (the last part of it), so displaying people’s reactions wouldn’t be in that crowded box anymore and amount of different reactions would be unlimited as well. My design is literally iMessage copy, but yeah, I like Telegram’s native iOS app look so I thought reactions should look as native as possible as well.

Yeah video calls were indeed heavily insisted (and so are the stories 😬), but they had little to no concepts really.

Not sure at all how much do they consider those concepts. But I’ll ask people at Beta group again and will let know. 

Yeah, insisting definitely helps. I’ve insisted my own personal [close to heart feature](https://i.imgur.com/TzKprsz.jpg) like 20 times over at Twitter myself, but they haven’t still added it. Asked and basically were told they’re just inspirations for the Telegram team for features and design. That's cool! Any other similiar stuff? By Alpha version, you mean the like bot, right??

Or is it some other feature that I don't know of? Absolute joy The platform is great, and I think telegram is the best messaging system. But on iOS I had these problems:

-	At home my network speed is very slow. I receive the notification of a new message, but when I open the app it says “connecting” and I have to wait some seconds for it to load before I can read
-	When you play an audio, you can’t control it form the widget in control center
-	folder navigation doesn’t work well with “swipe on the chat to do things” (delete, mark as read...)
-	I had some problem with uploads WITH THE APP OPENED and a fast LTE connection (150 Mbps download, 50 Mbps upload)
-	No upload if the app is closed

iOS has very strict rules regarding background processing, but Telegram is bad. I’m Italian and unfortunately the most used app here is WhatsApp. It’s not cloud based, so if you use the web version on the Mac, it basically uploads everything from the phone just in time and deletes it when you close the site. There are A LOT of background uploads, but it just works. Telegram’s Mac app is just better and much faster because it connects directly to the cloud, but if WhatsApp can upload all my chats, why can’t telegram send a 5 MB video? And Whats also does iCloud backups every night, in Background again. 
Also, when I receive a notification from WhatsApp, I tap on it and I can instantly read the message. 

Telegram spent time and money rebuilding the iOS client from the ground in Swift. But now it looks like they spend their days saying “boo Apple is bad” without caring about the small but important problems that afflicts their app. If I receive a message I just want to read it, and I shouldn’t care about replies not getting sent.
Whatsapp is bad and I’m not happy about my datas given away to Zucky, but it just works. 

Ps: I love Apollo too. Yeah. Awesome.
There's also their Twitter account. I go there sometimes and even when I don't comment anything, I ❤ other people's constructive suggestions. Definitely try that too. Comment under a new tweet of theirs every time, a few times, to see what you get.

I was actually thinking we'd better focus on the reactions feature for now. Simply because it is server-side.

Message corners are in-app offline tweaks. That mean someone outside telegram might circumvent them (take a sooner step) and implement it. (Like plus messenger-rafalense) And telegram will then follow.

But reactions need to be introduced from their own side first. And DAMN, It would take group chatting to the next level.

❇When someone says something, there's no need for 100+ people to send that ""I want it too, me too, I agree, I disagree etc"". Something that you probably see very often in telegram's beta group itself, ironically. Everyone expresses themselves with 1 tap without crowding the chat. I don't know another bot that does the exact same thing. But you can make polls using @vote.
That's also an inline bot to make polls (made of actual sentences not single emojis). Same question I just remembered something.
If you like a feature, feel free to do to their Twitter (@telegram) and simply ask for it under their latest posts.

Many do it regularly. At least it catches their direct attention there. I've seen complaints about the fact that the Telegram ios app stops downloads sometimes and doesn't allow download in the background.

Meaning that when you close the app (clear telegram from ram), downloads all stop. Other than that Ive never heard anything major.

ios is an okay OS. Tho I'm not a die-hard fan of it and personally prefer Android aaaany day. Maybe that's because I receive a lot of notifications and i prefer how Android handles them. I’ve commented and suggested that idea tens of times and mostly got a promise from them to pass the idea along, but still nothing.

I didn’t realise your point at first about server side feature mattering more, but yeah, you’re absolutely right. Something like Nicegram would probably release some in-app new feature way before and Telegram would then copy it.

I wouldn’t rush them to add reactions if it means they’d release a more polished version. >But reactions need to be introduced from their own side first. And DAMN, It would take group chatting to the next level.

They actually seem to already have support on the server side: [https://core.telegram.org/method/messages.getMessageReactionsList](https://core.telegram.org/method/messages.getMessageReactionsList) You can make native polls now, there's no need to use @vote anymore! Other cool inline bots are @gamee, @gamebot and @howgaybot Right.
Everyone is wondering what they have up their sleeves for the 8th year! Maybe it even turns out to be reactions. There has to be major stuff on the way. At least I hope there is.

Because the ""polls"" feature came to replace the @vote bot.
Maybe the ""reactions"" will come out to replace the @like bot this time.

Good luck. Thanks for following up on that.

Is there a secret way to send videos without them timing out over LTE and WiFi.;10;in2hbt;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/in2hbt/is_there_a_secret_way_to_send_videos_without_them/;26;[removed];2020-09-05 17:57:00;"Never had a problem with that so far, I don't send that many videos from mobile though.
 It could be some problem with power saveing settings though, specialy when you have problems with sending when the app is in the background. This might be an ios issue. I'm on the android 11 beta and am uploading a video to my saved messages, it does seem to slow down a bit when it's not front and center but on wifi at least, the upload is fairly quick when I have tg open. I just uploaded a 700 meg video in 2 minutes via wifi. >I am using iOS (yes, I know it sucks)

Don't worry, uploading videos sucks on android too. And it sucks on multiple levels. Sending videos on Telegram is a real pain, the android app is totally incapable of sending large videos unless you keep it in the foreground and disable your screen timeout. Telegram just doesn't want to acknowledge this is an utterly annoying issue I can confirm that I have the same issue with downloading/uploading but only videos :/

I have to constantly deactivate my wifi and activate it again beacuse it keeps timing out, and internet isn't an issue either (I'm from Romania).

It's probably an app issue I don't see why iOS prevents thi get closer to the server and use a better network. LTE and gigabit don't mean shit if your network throttles Telegram or upload speeds in general. my school has gigabit but can't stream Twitch or YouTube worth a damn. I think Apple disables or throttles apps when you are not ""looking at them"".

Same happens with Google Photos....it needs to be ON with the screen on for it to sync...

stupid dumb shit. That's incredible.  I will buy an Android 10 phone tomorrow and test this out.

I don't think it's a Telegram issue, I think iOS slows things down when you are not ""focused on them"".

Certainly the case with Google Photos....can't sync unless it is open and screen is on.  Which is shit.. I just tested with a 700meg video and on wifi I uploaded it in 2 minutes flat. I'm on 1gig down and usually max at like 35-50 megs up.

These seems like it's a localized issue with home wifi networks and ISPs being shitty. I've never had a problem downloading or uploading with telegram. > Don't worry, uploading videos sucks on android too.

uh, no? literally zero issues ever on Pixel devices. This is where I think the problem lies.  With the peace of shit iOS (just tested on iPad os 14-7 beta and it's still weird (WiFi6-iPadPro 2020, especially after switching apps).

I wish it would just work like Gmail...if something goes wrong..it would just resend automatically...just send in some type of an ""outbox"" till complete. I can stream 4K Netflix in a forest, lying in the bushes.

I am in Bulgaria, our Internet here on the coast is insane.

I have fiber right into my loft.

Are you able to answer my question. I think there's something in the settings called ""Background App Refresh"", try to manually turn it on for Telegram. That most likely will help with notifications if you're not properly receiving them, but maybe it helps with background tasks such as large video uploads too It could also be a routing issue from your isp to telegrams servers. Have you tested with the desktop client? > I'm on 1gig down and usually max at like 35-50 megs up

This is a very fast network, I've never been connected to a 1gig net in my entire life (eastern Italy). The best I can get at home is a 20mb down/5mb up DSL network, and here it's almost impossible to have Telegram realibly send a video that would take more than 10 minutes to upload. The persistent notification that is meant to allow Telegram to run in the background even when the phone screen is off will simply disappear, or just stay there but the upload in the chat just fails with the red question mark. I'm on LineageOS 16 (OnePlus 5T) and battery optimization for Telegram is truned off - uploads should work just fine, but when you're connected to the average wifi here uploading stuff is just a blind shot and you don't know whether it will fail or not. And LienageOS is quite permissive with background processes, I have friends with Huawei or stock OnePlus phones, which adopt much more aggressive battery optimiziation policies, that are costantly fighting with Telegram over large video uploads that simply stuck or fail. The funny thing is that sometimes, when an upload fails, the ""uploading video..."" notification stays there and you cannot remove it - and as long as it's there, the app will allow you to upload other medias (photos included), but the upload will never actually start. They just stay there in the chat, with the spinning progress circle not making any progress. It's infuriating. If there's a persistent notification, Telegram should be able to do what it takes to upload stuff just fine, even when the network is slow. I mean, it's not that the whole world has access to networks that are this fast - in fact is the exact opposite. If I am connected to a 300 kb/s network in upload, Telegram should just show a progress notification and take 40 minutes to upload my 700mb video isntead of... uh... diyng and acting weird. It's a shame that video sharing is so painful on a messaging platforms that allows to upload files up to 2gb yeah, and what? doesn’t change my comment. 

again, it doesn’t matter if you can stream 4K netflix in the middle of antarctica, if your ISP throttles Telegram, your upload speeds, and/or you’re far away from the Telegram servers, you’re going to have slow speeds. 

my school’s internet can upload a 500 MB PDF to Google Drive in minutes but can’t load YT in anything above 360p. that’s called throttling. so i’ve already answered your question, you just don’t like my answer. First off, learn how to make a paragraph. I can't read all of that without getting a headache. 

Second, my point was that if this was an android/telegram issue then I wouldn't see the speeds I do uploading/downloading with telegram.

As I said in another reply, it is also likely that is in a peering issue between an individuals isp and telegrams servers. You could do a ping and a tracert to see what telegram servers you are being connected to and maybe try a VPN or a proxy in a different country and see that makes anything better.

There are a lot variables here and you can't just say that it is  always a problem when not everyone will have the same experience as you. Why would my ISP throttle Telegram?

The issue is the same on LTE and at home...and at a restaurant...I am in the EU, I don't think certain apps get more benefits over others.

this is happening everywhere..*except Windows How do you propose they ""get closer to the server""? Ruling out local wifi and cell issues it could also be a peering and routing issue with the isps.

Just saying, get closer, tells me you have no clue how the internet and more specifically global services like telegram operate. They have servers all over the globe and sometimes you aren't routed to the closest one if your isp is shitty at peering/routing. because Telegram is often used for piracy and/or people using the app often use a lot of bandwidth. or they don’t want people using privacy focused apps so they make it hard to use compared to less secure solutions, like whatsapp or FB Messenger 🌚 they only have 5 DC’s wut OK OK I get you.  

I will test your theory later in the week.  Thanx... This is so full of shit it's not even funny. If they do only have 5 dcs, that makes my point even stronger, it also doesn't negate anything I said. Ignore this dunce, they have no idea what they are talking about.  Telegram isn't popular enough to be using enough bandwidth for a cell phone provider to throttle those connections. it really isn’t. plenty of users in africa we’re experiencing major throttling and completely shut downs of Telegram because so many users were using it in places like Ethiopia or Nigeria. Belarus and Russia also throttled and blocked Telegram during protests and times of unrest as well The throttling again sounds like a connectivity and backbone issue and not telegram itself having issues or telegram being throttled specifically.

As for the blocking of telegram by fascist regimes like Russia, were you not paying attention when that happened? They shot themselves in the foot, telegram is designed to reroute around blocks and all Russia did was block off half of the internet in an attempt to stop telegram and it didn't work. And telegram isn't the only service blocked by these regimes, signal, whats app and any other encrypted messaging will be attempted to be blocked if possible.

Again, you are conflating a few different issues and it's clear that you don't understand how the internet works and why you can't make a proclamation like you have because it's not black and white."

"What this feature does? ""Force TCP""? For those who have the knowledge, thank you!";59;imw22o;Telegram;https://i.imgur.com/9dZC0qu.png;37;;2020-09-05 08:59:55;"Simply put, most transfers of packets (small bits of information) can go through two different protocols. These are TCP and UDP.

TCP requires a handshake from the sender to confirm that their packet has been received.

UDP doesn't require any handshake and just kind of sends packets.

Both of these protocols have different advantages, with the primary ones of TCP being that there will be superb stability and zero packet loss, and the primary ones of UDP being that it's faster and on connections where you're less likely to see instability and packet loss it can be almost as equally stable.

I'm not entirely sure, however Telegram might use a mix of TCP and UDP. I'll put this very simply... if you are having problems with stability, you may want to force TCP, however there shouldn't be a need to do so otherwise. Do you want to hear TCP joke? Some web filtering platforms cannot do UDP traffic. This is probably a way to get around that. TCP receiver sends acknowledgment for every packet received. There is sequence number in every packet.
If the sender doesn’t receive an ACK for a specific TCP packet, it will resend it.
For voice calls, it is useless to receive a packet delayed.
So most voice call apps use UDP because there is no need to receive a old “chunk” of voice late. 
UDP is also faster because it doesn’t do checks.

I think you can force TCP to bypass possible network restrictions on UDP traffic. TCP stands for Taco Consumption Protocol. So when you force it, the receiver is forced to consume a taco Where is it? Did you enable TCP/IP settings?

Did you enable cookies? Basically this

https://images.app.goo.gl/HgQiEKYsrxRQkRqL6 Most likely it uses TCP for text and file transfer and UDP for voice and video calls. A little late, but one small correction. TCP doesn’t prevent packet loss so much as it will try again of there’s no acknowledgment from the other side. Maybe if it detects inestability, it forces itself TCP, but always starts with UDP? (Maybe some protocol more polished, but with the same idea) Yes, I'd like to hear a TCP joke. You and yourself have too much time on your hands Hahaha that was funny 😂😂😂 don't get me started on Challenge-Response-Authentication-Protocol Found it. It's in debug menu. Long press on version in Settings (Android) and then click it again. Then choose Call settings. Yeah exactly.

TCP formally hands it off, UDP just kind of goes ""here's your data"". the best joke about UDP is that I don't care do you get it or not Not all shitposters wear capes! Yup. I'd agree with that.

TCP is almost definitely used for text and file transfer, and UDP is the primary for voice and video, however it might fall back to TCP if you're experience issues. My hypothesis is that this just simply forces TCP all the time instead of when there is packet loss. Ah yes. My bad.

That's totally correct. I just meant that it prevented it in the way that UDP will just forget about a packet if it gets lost, in how TCP will continue trying until it gets a timeout or the packet gets confirmation. I personally don't use Telegram as much anymore, and I also haven't done any proper analysis or reading on the protocols that Telegram uses. However I'm assuming that it's a mix of both, reverting to TCP if there is noticeable packet loss. Again, this ""Force TCP"" option is just there so that way people can do so without having to stress that you can't. Ok, I'll tell you a TCP joke I don't get it. Is that a UDP joke? UDP Let me Hey a joke guys tell you about This is a udp joke.

Would you like to hear a tcp joke? Network architect here. If there’s packet loss in transit, using TCP for voice and video is a terrible way to solve it as TCP will simply resend lost packets and they’ll arrive out of order, which renders a pretty rubbish experience for voice/video apps. I have received the TCP joke. I didn't get it Oh yeah! 

Sorry I must've over thought that. Great to see someone who is a professional in the field weigh in. I did not send it :) (here's [The TCP joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6p8hmy/hello_would_you_like_to_hear_a_tcp_joke/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)) Haha I don't know if this is a common joke but it was good. Would you like to hear a tcp joke?

Telegram as cloud storage is it reliable?;35;imihop;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/imihop/telegram_as_cloud_storage_is_it_reliable/;27;"I have been using this for years as cloud storage for free as many cloud storage service offer very limited space .
But won't something terrible happen in the future like servers shutdown for some reasons n I lose all my contents .
Should I keep doing it";2020-09-04 18:54:15;"I personally find it reliable. However, whatever important stuff I store there, I also have a backup of it on an external 4TB HDD.

I deem it extremely unlikely that one day your data just vanishes. If they are about to shut down or something, they will give you a notice to download your data before they delete. But that may only happen if the entire platform is about to shut down.

Another possibility is that you get hacked and the perpetrator deletes your files. You can easily prevent this by setting up 2F auth with a complicated password.

You may also get banned by Telegram. I have read threads where people say they have been banned for no reason. However, I dont believe it. They probably did something against the TOS.

Some gov may also seize their datacenters in one of the countries they have servers in. I do not know if they keep copies of data across multiple datacenters in different countries but if they don't, you and many other uses will definitely lose the data this way.

In short, keep local copies as well. If you're using Telegram to store important stuff, let me tell you that you're doing something really really wrong. don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Server shutdown is unlikely. But if it happens that you lose your account (hacking, change of phone number, telegram banning you etc.) it will suck. Believe me, It's not. I had so many files in mine (not so  important) and i clicked on  'clear history' by mistake 😂 Reliable? Maybe. Time will tell. Fast? Hell no. Can’t sature even 1/10 of my 500 Mb/s. remember if you don't use Telegram for 1 year it vanishes everything Why would you do this? While there's no telling what happens 10 or 20 years into the future and servers may shut down some time in the distant future, the same can be said for any cloud storage service. Personally, my recommendation is to store your stuff BUT not in Saved Messages. Instead, use a private channel that nobody else has access to. Keep the invite link to it saved somewhere so that even if you change accounts you can still access the files and transfer them to your new account. Makes it easy to store stuff and download it anywhere you want without risk of losing them. The upload can be a bit slow but I use it all the time and I find it reliable In terms of privacy yeah it's good. But telegram's supposed to be a messenger not a personal upload center!! It's like using a saw to cut cheese. Sure nothing goes wrong but it's just not the tool for that job.

But I personally find myself using Drive apps for that purpose simply because that's what they've been designed to do. There's mediafire, Google drive, One drive etc etc. You tell more.

and if you sum them up together, they already give you almost 20 gigs of upload storage, which is enough for average people.

⚠Also as far as I know, since telegram is not for that purpose specifically, it sorta slows down your upload speed at a certain point when it recognizes that the file is going to be big!!! I don't know what algorithm it uses to detect that but I've experienced it.

Because of that, is not really traffic/cost/time-efficient to upload to an app that kinda resists when your uploads are going to be massive. Drive spaces are more efficient in those cases. There are a lot of ways to use telegram as cloud storage!
Well first one is the ''Saved Messages''
But if you're worried about getting hacked, banned or changing your phone number
You can create a private upload then leave the channel and keep the link somewhere safe?
You can get back as admin whenever you want! I had my entire saved chat history cleared once out of nowhere a couple years back. Never got an explanation. Probably safe for the short term. Hard to say about the long term. They recently increased the maximum single file size from 1.5 GB to 2 GB.
I think they're doing fine for the time being. In my opinion it is reliable, if you read in the FAQ they care a lot about users' privacy. As for the loss of data in case of closing the application I do not think because now it is between the 10 most downloaded applications in the world No, they are not reliable. No cloud is safe out there. keep important things on local drive. Less important things may be in cloud I agree, i still find storing locally the best way for important stuff. Well shit I don't know why you got downvoted for that 🤔 Holy shit, okay I'm backing them up. Thanks, my dude What? It’s objectively the worst way Why It's not a backup if you only have one copy. Cloud storage is redundant by himself but you should STILL have other copies It undermines the whole purpose of cloud storage The purpose for me is to pull shit off my phone or laptop really quick. Otherwise I got hard drives backups in my basement and parents house

Or all 2 local back ups and a telegram/cloud back up. Don't have one back up"

Calls interrupt after 17 minutes. For a few weeks now, my calls on Telegram interrupt after ~17 minutes every time. It started after the last upgrade which made video-calls possible. It keeps re-dailing and then it just ends. Anyone facing similar issues?;115;ilrowt;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/ceklp0b55xk51.jpg;26;;2020-09-03 14:34:06;"Maybe you are out of memory on the phone or have really big cache? I had the issue, I've fixed updating my Telegram and ASKING TO. THE OTHER SIDE too, to update his/her Telegram version. It's all fine with me... I even made calls lasting more than 45 minutes, but it all went fine... Never happened to me No, I had long calls, never had this kind of problem, probably just a coincidence This happened to me as well.

Every 17 minutes or some times 18, it would switch to “connecting” and the phone call would cut.

It was weird. Wait for the next updat4 Sounds like it is more unique to your experience. I have been unable to duplicate this problem. My wife had the same issue, not sure if it was exactly 17 mins or not. Check the cache Maybe 🔋 saver... 1024 seconds = 17 mins. Is this something that can be related? We both did. This it how the troubles started It's for several weeks now. *Always*. Exactly 17 minutes. Boom, got it 17 minutes and 4 seconds, indeed. mmm... Which is the version and build exactly? Did you tried with having the last version of the app for your contact as well, as someone already said? Did that worked for you? Probably some stupid hard-coded limit in the code lol Explain? How much storage does 1 second take and how do we know that? Solved! Thank you! I have Telegram for Android 7.0.1 (2065) arm64-v8a and on the other side there's v7.0.0 (2064) arm64-v8a It might be a integer overflow problem. They may use a number to keep track of each second (or maybe each data packet) maybe the memory where this number is stored is to small and that may cause problems when the space limit is hit. 
1024 needs exactly 10bit to be stored in binary.
Its probably a 16bit value and they count every 1/64th seconds.

We dont need exact knowledge about how much storage one second takes, this number looks like its the storage of the second counter itself. I didn't look at the source code but it can't be a coincidence. It might be anything buffer related
/#define BUFFER_SIZE_MAX 1024 So the other side has no fix. As alredy explained, BOTH sides of the calls need to be updated. You are the prototypical *user*! Knowing it better than those trying to help you, contradicting yourself and *lying*."

Yep. I spooked my girl when I ended our call with ""And don't forget to charge your battery, it's really low"".
She is now paranoid I can somehow stalk her phone. Good prank I may be paranoid but I hope the caller is aware, otherwise it could be a privacy issue. can anyone tell me please what are the emojis that appear in the top right during the call. they are always different Now if only they could tell us that Amanda read my message, when it was really her just brother Carl in our 3 person group. Will Telegram provide me an Amanda too? There could be an app the sends this signal on command. It would be awesome to use this as an excuse to quicky end a useless call. LOVE the contact photo. TIL In google maps app? ok ''I know what you did last summer, Amanda.'' I'd like to know how that is (or could be) a privacy issue. No, caller is not aware. It's an indicator of the encryption key used to secure the call. If they're the same on both phones, the call is secure, if it's not, you both have different encryption keys and it's not private. it's got something to do with the e2e encryption. if they're the same on both participants devices, the handshake was successful and the connection is secure. 🙄 Yep. It won't show it to just anybody - only people with whom you've explicitly shared your location, but Telegram isn't the only app that does this. Giving out information about the state of your device unwillingly is a privacy issue. Suppose your battery is low at 9am, that probably means you probably weren't being very responsible the night before. Your employer might become suspicious that you are hung over, again. Can it be disabled? Do you know how to encrypt it if it’s different? so should we verify each call? I really don't see the issue with battery level, can you be more specific on why the battery thing is a privacy concern? Or I simply forgot to charge it the night before, as I often do.

What I do out of the time of work is none of the boss' business. I'd like to know how one can abuse this feature for it to be a privacy concern. Are you asking what to do if the emojis are different on the two devices? There's nothing you can do, it means someone is listening in on your conversation and possibly more.

Here's what you do: hang up. Check for suspicious wifi if you're in public. Do a scan for viruses on your device. Tell the other person to do the same. Then question why someone would want to listen in on your conversations.. that's about all you can do. yes... if you feel you need to check telegram's work, so to speak. Anything that is being shared about you without your consent is a privacy issue by definition, surely. Some people use Telegram to hide from their government or stalking. Literally anything can be used to track you down or give some information about your behaviour, even something as silly as battery level.

For example, if they know you always charge your phone at home, they could predict if you'll be at home or analyze your behaviour. Heck, they can even make a solid guess on your password only by how your phone moved while you typed, no one knows what they're capable of.

This comment has a good explanation:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ikr2qb/good_job_telegram_good_job/g3ou02o?context=3 right.. but then you start seeing ads for ""Alarm Clocks"" and ""sleep therapy""  all over the internet

you may think it was not the advertisers business what you do on your free time but and advertiser that determined that you are employed and being tardy regularly might disagree. 

they may even say it IS their business I'M GOING TO CHARGE YOUR PHONE (As I said above)

Giving out information about the state of your device unwillingly is a privacy issue.

You'd be surprised how much some people are able to guess just by minimal information. Sorry for the wall of text. (also an answer for u/Anonymous3355 )

**TL;DR:** 

depending on your threat model, abuse of this feature could range from *""gee it sucks that I can't decide who gets to see my battery status""* to ""***HOLY SHIT my enemies now have a surveillance vector to reasonably determine my whereabouts""***. 

Most of us are boring people who fall on the first case, but people using Telegram for **political activism** or other forms of ""*sticking it to the man*"" be it on BLM, Kyiv or Hong Kong protests may fall on the second case. And it would really suck for them.

In my following text wall, I explain what  ***indirect behavioral signals*** are, and how they can be enriched with ""***out of band signals""***  (observations or data originating from places other than your app or device) and thus be used to **determine your location with reasonable accuracy** , or to use **statistical inference to determine your daily habits**, after setting up some passive surveillance of these seemingly innocent signals. 

If you read all the text you'll be rewarded with a GitHub repo containing python scripts that abuse Facebook's API to setup exactly this kind of surveillance. I'm not sure if the API has changed enough that the script will not work anymore, but I have used it successfully up until early 2019.

&#x200B;

So this is the idea:

There is a good deal of information that can be inferred from unknowingly leaking your battery levels and charging status.

Of course, you need additional signals, but the charging status can be a confirmation signal for location inference. This is what we call an **""indirect signal""**

For example, suppose you know your girlfriend's morning routine, - say she usually jogs sometime in the morning. - You could passively monitor the battery charging signal through the API (instead of using a client) or by using TDLIB or some other library,such as *Telethon (pure python)*

If you **observe** that the phone stops charging at 7:00 and starts charging again at 7:45 you could reasonably infer that she left home shortly after 7:00 and that she probably won't be back until at least. 7:30, assuming **she does this regularly** and that she behaves as most normal humans do: charge the phone overnight and unplug it to take it with you when you leave.

If you perform enough observations, you could gather enough data to perform *reasonably accurate statistical inference* about her habits. **THIS IS PASSIVE SURVEILLANCE** as you only need to observe the signals that the user *may not be aware they are broadcasting*"" or or worse, that they may be unable to disable.

Of course this signal is not sufficient in itself to be a security or privacy concern. However, **we broadcast all kinds of observable data** (sometimes called our *""digital wake""* or *""data shadow""* that an adversary may be able to collect (credit card receipts, public transportation passes, web browsing on other devices like your desktop pc, or public social media activity (tweets for example) These are called ***out of band signals*** because they exist outside the realm of the app or device that we wish to secure

In the absence of a high quality geolocation signal such as a shared GPS location, **a combination of secondary and out of band  signals, can be aggregated to get a pretty accurate picture of where a person is.**

Sometimes (depending on the threat model) you don't even need to know where someone is, it's good enough to know when they are NOT at a specific place. 

Say, for example's sake, if you wanted to surprise your GF for her birthday, by getting you and some friends into your GFs apartment, for the proverbial surprise party.  The best time to try this might be when she just left her place for her morning jogging routine.

In this example, you only need **2 signals** to determine if she is not at her place: **her schedule** which we assume she either shared with you, or you have observed, (out of band) and an **indirect confirmation signal: her phone battery stops charging.** 

This IS a privacy issue, specially under certain high risk threat models: I can think of one common example: *""a political activist that wishes to maintain* ***plausible deniability*** *as to his whereabouts* versus a determined state actor abusing these signals for **passive surveillance**

**THIS IS A SERIOUS PRIVACY CONCERN THAT CAN HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES**

Most people in the world are not worth the effort or are not that interesting to bother with any individualized surveillance. Aggregate data for shitloads of users is more valuable commercially, **but individual surveillance could be possible** if you're interesting enough  to the government or even a resourceful acquaintance , the stereotypical techie stalker that decides you're worth surveilling

Here's some practical, low effort, high yield methods for passive surveillance of leaked signals, as promised:

[https://github.com/defaultnamehere/zzzzz.git](https://github.com/defaultnamehere/zzzzz.git)

This is a simple python script that abuses the Facebook API. The script works by impersonating leaving the FB desktop app, and recording the status changes of any contacts on your friend list.

The API used to broadcast 4 distinct online statuses that were invisible to users, not do much to curious and determined abusers.

After collecting data for a few hours the author determined that the online statuses matched the Facebook web app, the Facebook mobile app, instagram, and another status which was later determined to be the WhatsApp online status for each user.

You could leave the script running for two or three days, and it would helpfully create a graph for each of the users on your contact list.

By looking at these graphs, it was pretty easy to determine **at what time people were going to sleep** and whether they were at a desktop computer or a mobile phone. The blog post on the README file  this repository is both amusing and terrifying. I really recommend reading it.

Granted, it's not exactly the same situation, as Telegram's online status is properly secured on the API, and you can choose which of your contacts may see it. I expect a similar mechanisms is in place for the battery status messages (I have not reviewed the latest changes to TLIB or the raw API schema)

But this same script could be trivially modified to collect data by observing Telegram signals via TLIB, or Telethon. This is the sort of passive surveillance that **-if the user is not aware, or cannot control-** are ***serious privacy concerns.*** Privacy is an emotion. 

If people walk by your house and look into your house, no one has been harmed. Nothing’s been stolen. 

But yet you can “feel” violated. Privacy is in the eye of the beholder. 

If I call someone and information about my device is being shared without my consent, I “feel” violated. 

Privacy concerns aren’t about harm - they are about emotions. abusive relationship / stalker Thank you! It's not something about you, it's something about your battery.

It's like if it would share the size of your display, I don't see how it it violates your private life Surely not anything, examples include: my hair color, my favorite brand of crisps, the battery level on my phone etc. you are being charged for privacy theft telegram That is one hell of a wall of text. I don't know if You've mentioned it, but just choosing who can call you is a good way to restrict who can see that in the first place. I am genuinely shocked seeing people downvoting this. Very thorough explanation, down to the lowest level, thank you.

I believe that no piece of personal/device information should be disclosed by default if it’s not directly needed for the feature you’re implementing (voice call in this case). Opt-in model plus “would you like to turn this feature on? Yes, no (keep turned off), read more (wiki page)” will do. Definitely saving this to read later. Super interesting. Great exaplanation, thanks for the effort. Thanks a lot for this detailed explanation. You've essentially given words to what was in my mind from little under an year. Based upon an individual's threat model, anything and everything can be used against them. Very informative. Wall of text so I just skimmed through it, but the examples you're making are totally different from this one. Everyone should know that they're sharing their low battery status with the people they're in call with. It's impossible for anyone to know my battery status via Telegram without me being in Telegram call with them, so it's no broadcast. And even if people don't know that - you shouldn't call people who you don't trust in the first place. That can give away so much more info about you other than the low battery status... False. Privacy is a state of knowledge. As it relates to one person or its possessions it's a right. 

Just ask any teenager who wishes to exclude others in his immediate circle (parents and siblings) as to knowledge of what he does with his genitals while consuming erotic material. Hell, he'll want to privilege the knowledge of what kind of reading material is in his possession. 

So Privileging knowledge (not disseminating it) IS PRIVACY. it is as much a ""feeling"" as freedom is: you may feel free, buy in actual fact you may not realise that you are not free. in a similar fashion, you might think knowledge about you or your activities is privileged, while in actual fact it is not. If that's what's going on, you got a whole different set of problems going on already. The stranger shouldn't even be able to call, as they've should've been blocked an eternity ago already. >abusive relationship / stalker

But why you on the phone them?
That aside. How do they use that info?

""I saw you at your work. Your phone was fully charged. Now I know that while you walk anywhere you're glued to your phone, using the same apps which drain your phone's battery at 12.3% per hour. If you were home you would have plugged it in. But you didn't. Which means you walked for at least 7 hours. Which google says is exactly how long it takes to walk to that dude Craig's place from your work""?

I just don't see another way to use it for malicious purposes. Do clue me in though, genuinely curious. Well as others have mentioned it *could* become a privacy issue:

“Why have you used your phone that much - I asked you not to be on it all the time”

I’m not saying that everybody would dislike this information being shared; I’m saying that *some* might and hence it should be something you can deselect. Sharing any of those without your consent is a privacy issue, yes, even if you think they're trivial. Personally, there are many cases where u wouldn't want the person in talking to to know my hair color. Deal with it. I think you're right, but you definitely chose bad examples, as those quite define you in some way. Probably the battery level on your phone is equivalent to whether or not your hand is closed or open right now, or whether you have your shoelaces tied right now.

And even then, I think that what you can say is that *very few people* may be concerned for sharing these info, but you'll always find someone that wants to hide even those, and they probably should be able to, if they want to. Yes, restricting who can call you, is definitely a good idea.

Whether that is enough, depends on how the API restricts access based on those permissions. 

In the Facebook abuse example, the API endpoints were undocumented, were not user-visible and had no obvious UI interactions, the developers relied on users not poking around the JS cosole to keep them safe. 

MTPROTO enforces much of the security, which is sounder and saner by design and less error pronr; rather the  relying on UI interactions or lack thereof to keep them safe.

 That doesn't mean that new layers of the protocol could be exploitable, but in my opinion, that would be unlikely. 

There's only one way not find out: try and abuse the Telegram API, particularly avoiding UI checks and poke it with all sorts of invalid or unexpected input to see if it handles such input gracefuly as it has  consistently  done in the past or see if it cracks open wide like FB's API (BTW it did not need poking, just looking a the network activity when there shouldn't be any to realise there was some him funny going on there) yes, they are different but analogous. the idea was to show how seemingly innocent signals can be abused by enriching them with other innocent signals. each by themselves does not provide enough data for effective surveillance, but if you combine them, you can infer a lot of what is going on behind those signals. Telegram has done a great job at giving users control of what signals they make available to others. I expect this to be the case for the battery signal. But everyone needs to realise that even then, just using telegram does not mean you are in control of your privacy, you need to mind what you do on other apps and IRL.

For most this is a non-issue. For activists, dissidents, (and yes, criminals) this is something that could keep you alive or out of jail.

The fact that the UI displays this information to another user when the battery is low and you are in a call means that the information IS available under certain conditions. these conditions are met by the app.

that doesn't mean, the API can't be fooled to think it is on a call while it is not. that's what ""hackers"" do: use APIs in ways that they were not intended for. If the API and protocol are secure, then passive monitoring of this kind is possible. 

Now, don't get me wrong, i think the MTPROTO design is pretty robust, but it is not impossible to do. Anyone can write an automated Telegram Client (userbots) hell, ive written 2 or 3 its not that hard... to telegram servers it looks exactly like any other telegram client. to other users it looks like i am connected. to achat or group.

That is how group scrapers work, they just sit there like a real user, but just record who joins the group instead of chatting with anyone .. the ""silent guys"" in your group may be automated scrapers harvesting user ids for later spamming, They can just as easily monitos online status passively. 

Telegram counters this by giving me the ability of not broadcasting my status o anyone or to members of a certain group. that's the kind of control that i expect for the battery level signal. 

if its displayed somewhere,the data is available. if i can't control its availability, then you  must assume it is being broadcast, because UIs can be faked and APIs can be abused. period > But why you on the phone them? That aside. How do they use that info?

Don't blame battered women. ""Mind your own damn business""

""I forgot to charge it""

""Some app is draining my battery""

""Yes, you are right, bye bye"" > endpoints undocumented, not user-visible

Security through obscurity, smh >if its displayed somewhere,the data is available. if i can't control its availability, then you  must assume it is being broadcast

At this point, everything is an assumption, but yours is a paranoid one. I think it would be much more reasonable to assume my battery status is only shared when I'm in call and only shared with the person I'm calling. And yes, the account I'm calling may well be automated, but I totally don't see how I can be in call without being aware. I'm always aware of whether I'm calling anyone and of who I'm calling. In that case I'm totally aware of who I'm sharing my info with. Excuse you? I didn't blame anyone. And you saying only women can be battered or they're the only ones you care about? it may be paranoid in your threat model, as is for most people. the worst that could happen is that you can't use ""low battery"" as an excuse to hang up on an unwanted call.

it may not be paranoid but totally reasonable to Uyghurs in china wishing to call loved ones while the government is surveilling your every move for an excuse to throw you in a reeducation camp

Yo I think I’m being hacked wtf is going on with telegram I’m being added to hundreds of groups and it won’t stop. I tried deleting the app and changing my username doesn’t work. What should I do?;67;ikmr2f;Telegram;https://v.redd.it/bds5rqt55kk51;31;;2020-09-01 18:49:35;"Change your privacy settings so that only your contacts can add you in groups and channels That sucks. Your account has likely been included in some spam list and there are bots adding it to groups and channels just to increase their members count. Changing username or deleting the app won't stop whoever is abusing you: the correct thing to do is, as someone already suggested, go to ""settings -> privacy and security -> groups and channels"", and change it to ""my contacts"". Also while leaving the spam chats, do not forget to report them for spam using the popup right below the chat title! Holy crap. Thanks so much everyone I think that did the trick. Oh man that freaked me out. I go in to check my messages and I see all of this crazy shit I was stunned 😳 Youve been cursed With how many unread messages you got i doubt you're being actively added anymore.

Check your Active Sessions, Devices or however it is called on your device. Log out everything you do not recognize.

Update your privacy settings to only allow Contacts to add you to groups. Lastly check your privacy settings for your phone number. You can decide to show it to nobody, not even contacts. If I were you'd I'd just delete the account and set up a new one Check which devices you are logged in, if you don't recognize any of them then logout of it I've to haven't already, check your active sessions which show devices that have your account logged in them, and terminate devices you aren't familiar with. You just sick famous man. That's about it. Jokes aside please try not to join channels or groups cause people usually spam from there only. Yeah i had that happen once too with my phone and i went ahead and shut off group inviting and never happened since its dumb they allow other people to auto invite you like that Deactivate other sessions You used a voip number to create that telegram account, the number was released for inactivity, and then somebody else probably took over that number and it's using it with their telegram. Happened to me before. I want telegram to add a 'nobody' option to this setting as well It seemed to have work thanks a lot much appreciated I reported all of them for spam maybe telegram will take a look and doable their groups or something thanks again 😊 I wonder how this happens. Where do the spammers get your information to add you in these groups, and why does changing username not work to stop them?

It happened to me just once, but even then I had no idea how they had my username or whatever. I even hid my phone number from everyone. Yea those unread messages are from these groups I’ve got added on thankfully the issue got resolved and yes I have all of it set to private thanks 😊 *If I were you'd I'd*

*Just delete the account and*

*Set up a new one*

^(Opt out of replies: ""haikusbot opt out"" | Delete my comment: ""haikusbot delete"") Nah, it's pretty clearly bots adding them to groups, if this was someone else using the account, there's no way they'd be able to add themselves to groups that fast. OP's username was likely posted on some ""spam that person"" board or forum, thankfully they can just tweak privacy settings to avoid these assholes. I would love a “nobody” option as well You can unsync and delete your contacts from telegram server. Then, no one will be able to add you to a group or a channel [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/gyeool/what_information_is_disclosed_to_others_in/ftcghqf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Yeh i'd love that Most of the times, they have these ""crawler accounts"" that scrape the members list of the groups they join, and try to add them to the channels they want to spam. If you recently joined a public chat, it's possible that one of these automated users accounts saw you there and added you to their lists. If you are targeted by the the kind of spam you've described in the OP, that's likely the case. Technically, this would also work with channels (eg. an administrator of the channel can see most recent 200 subscribers, and potentially add them to other chats)

Changing username wouldn't help because these bots simply remember your unique user id, and use it to adds the account to a group/channel (that's basically what every Telegram app do when an user adds another user to a group - they tell telegram to add user 123456789 to the group 987654321, on behalf of the currently logged-in user. Telegram will accept the request only if the users have met before (eg. they share a group in common). It's the downside of offering an open API, it's easier for spammers to build automated malicious tools) if you change your username they get your updated username. Good bot. The delete option does not work. I keep seeing contacts form years ago popping up as "" xxx joined telegram"". Also the ""alert me when someone joins telegram - > off“ doesn't work either. Annoying as hell. That's really interesting. Thanks for the in-depth reply! Oh I didn't know that, thanks! Still doesn't explain where they get my contact info in the first place. Have you followed the steps reported into the link? If so, it could be a bug. Yes countless of times. My problem is that one time I logged in from a friend's android tablet. and for years I kept seeing his contacts showup as ""XXX Joined Telegram"" dispite doing the ""delete contacts"". 

I checked my active sessions and there are none other than my phone and both my PC's. This is strange. Which android and smartphone do you have?"

How private are non-secret chats of telegram?;43;ik880j;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ik880j/how_private_are_nonsecret_chats_of_telegram/;39;;2020-09-01 01:34:29;"Telegram, unlike most other messengers, has a very good track record of keeping any chats private.

However, unless you are using secret (end-to-end encrypted) chats, they technically COULD read your messages.

If the primary reason you switched to telegram is security, maybe you should look into something like Signal. Telegram, however, is a great middle ground for someone who does care about privacy, but isn't a security freak, and it has many more features) You can read these articles (you have to put in front telegra.ph (telegram blog platform) since reddit started to [block it](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/iehlae/reddit_auto_remove_post_with_telegram_telegraph/?context=3)):

* What-are-the-features-of-a-secure-and-private-communication-service-07-10
* How-really-secure-and-private-is-Telegram-09-02
* Why-Isnt-Telegram-End-to-End-Encrypted-by-Default-02-23 All chats are encrypted with Secret ones being E2E - effectively meaning that nobody but the two devices talking can ever read those messages because only those have the decryption keys.

For the others, the decryption keys are split between multiple servers that are all over the world. So still private and safe from prying eyes. Are not private since they are not end2end.
Use a secret chat if you want something private Are NS chats saved on the device 'at rest'? They can’t read private chat Telegram asks' for my phone number, if I give it, who else can see it? I will keep using telegram, I like it because there are tons of groups about topics I care (VIM, \*NIX, python...)   


I was just curious about this I will be downvoted into oblivion die this opinion, but:

 WhatsApp has End2End Encryption for every chat, you don't have to enable it. Although that is why it's not possible to have WA on more then one device. (similar to Telegram Secret Chat)

I love Telegram and all its features, but the encryption isn't up to date. 

Security by obscurity isn't an accepted security strategy. Interesting. This post has been removed; did you ever find out why this happens? No. Only secret chats are e2e. I have had a couple secret chats going before and one day they just were gone. Deleted. All the memes and all but neither I nor the other person deleted it. Do you know how to keep the chat from disappearing on my device? No, as far as I know whom you have enabled in this [setting](https://i.imgur.com/ZHYmoiM.png). The most anybody absolutely has to see is a name you set, and avatar — pretty sure everything else can be hidden. I might add that WhatsApps E2E Encryption is useless if you have the cloud backup function enabled because the cloud backups are not encrypted. WhatsApp encryption is kinda fake.

I mean, the data IS encrypted, but what's the point of E2E, if a third party (Facebook themselves) have been seen decrypting the data and handing it over to goverment agencies?

Here in Russia, we don't have freedom of speech. You can be sent to jail for ""offending the feelings of believers"" (yes, that's the literal name of the law). So sometimes privacy from the goverment can be important. E2E is not a reason for not having multiple devices, there are ways around it, as seen on Wire for instance Telegram doesn't use security through obscurity. The standard chats use asymmetric cryptography. It's open source too. How Keybase do it? > that is why it's not possible to have WA on more that one device 

Signal is completely E2EE by default, and you can chat seamlessly on multiple devices.   

WA just don't thing it is useful to have this option, and also to make this happen they'll need to build it from scratch, so it'll cost them fortune. It should be a [bug](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/iehlae/reddit_auto_remove_post_with_telegram_telegraph/?context=3). Yes, that's what they said I believe that is impossible and any party involve in any secret chat can delete it and its content on a whim. I would like to add that WA is closed-source. So even if they claim they are using Signal's protocol it's up to people to trust them or not. They are probably using a modified version of it. The app might as well steal the encryption keys of the conversations without anyone knowing. That is not how E2E encryption works. 

They can't decrypt the data. Or Keybase The cryptography is not completly published and ist not checked. They developed their own standard, which is not something you should do. 

It's Just something you should Knie, Telegram has a lot of features, but security is mit one of their best. what was strange is one that i was in and used a lot, my friend said he still had the convo on his phone, but not on mine. also when i asked him to send another message to see if it would bring it back up for me, it still didnt.  has that every happened to you? Exactly.

Yet, they apparently can. 

That's why I said it's fake. I'm talking about the non-secret chats.

But even the secret chats use a published, standard encryption method as of version 2. Which part of the e2e related code isn't published? Sounds like your device key changed somehow so you couldn't decrypt the messages. Yes, it happend to me. Please provide a source for your claim.

AFAIK, the content of the messages can't be read by any third party.

Facebook can, however, read the metadata, i.e. when you contacted who. how do i find out if thats what it was? i dont fully understand encryption and all that. i thought maybe it was bc the mwmoey on my phone is low or something.  bc when it got down to a gb or less
sometimes it happened, never before that Do you know how to prevent it from happening? My friends didnt delete the convo. Is there a setting to prevent it? It's a part of the law in Russia that all messengers are to provide means to decrypt ALL MESSAGES to law enforcement. Whatsapp complied, so it was left alone. Telegram refused, so a huge (unsuccessful) campaign was launched to attempt to block telegram and prevent it from working. Happened a couple of years ago, you can read about it online.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_Telegram_in_Russia

Since whatsapp is closed source, they can blatantly LIE about end-to-end encryption, or, which is more likely, still have a master key do decrypt all messages (which defeats the purpose of E2E)

As you said, if E2E IS actually implemented correctly (which it is in telegram, you can verify it by looking ay the source code of the client apps), it's impossible for anyone except the two clients to decrypt the messages."

 [https://imgur.com/a/80ELO1n](https://imgur.com/a/80ELO1n) Unfortunately, that command only works for the active session. Once Telegram is restarted or the PC is restarted, auto-update happens upon launch. This is rather strange behavior.  It shouldn't work that way. I know! And that's what's driving me nuts! While 2.3.X is broken (for me), I want to at least keep 2.2 stable and locked in. Do you install it or you use portable version? Fully installed on Windows 10, via official .exe from Telegram site. Downloaded the Portable Version zip folder, unzipped, and launched the .exe straight out of that folder. No installation. You can try official portable version to see if it’s helps. Just fully quit Telegram Desktop 2.2 and launched the portable 2.3.1 variant downloaded from the site. Upon login in the portable version, microphone activity would transmit via voice message and audio could be heard via voice messages received. Nevertheless, a call initiates and no audio is transmitted or heard.

The problem here is at the core of the 2.3.X build and not exclusive to standard vs. portable, it appears."

But who the hell wants that? I'm not AGAINST stories. I mean I wouldn't downvote people that say they want it.

However if it makes its way to telegram, I'd want it to be optional to see them or interact with them in any way. Eg. Option to completely disable them all over the app.

✔Stories/status updates aren't bad per sé. It's the users that have misunderstood what these options are for. Think of them in terms of knives. Well maybe not that serious but you get the idea. ;)) Damn I would like to say that I'd appreciate it for my scientific channel but I'm scared of 14/50 yo and of your downvotes

*Stories bad* To be honest, its not that bad.  
I dont use it, but the reason I hate it, is because I can't completely hide it from my home page. It means we don't like to see story feature on telegram. We want an official catalog of channels to find them easier. I believe it's talking about this ""comment"" that you can put alongside your profile. Like a Twitter description of sorts.

It's initial purpose was for saying ""I at work"", ""Studying"" and things like that but people just use it for crappy motivational quotes and shit. 

For example I use it to promote Signal, 😅.

It's either that or WhatsApp's stories, which are basically Instagram stories but for your phone contacts (I do not even know why somebody thought this was a good idea) No, the concept isn't bad. However, Telegram has always been a pure communication tool, not social media. Look at their own actions, they know this and carefully add features with time. Ones that enable authentic communication. The day they add stories, following, etc. (which I highly doubt) many people who liked the original idea would leave the platform. WhatsApp has to add shit like that to draw more *engagement* \- and that's necessary to them because they'll have to monetize with ads at some point. Telegram's principle is to stay away from ads. So they wouldn't add addictive bloat like that. But I'd happily use cool features like location-based discovery, groups, and many others. That's a very interesting view! Whatsapp is also against ads and it is very unlikely to change because Facebook has another chat app that features ads so it would make sense for them to have a diverse approach.

I believe it does not show these numbers, however some resources are limited. while this sounds like a creative approach I don't think there's a color that would hide the number have more than 50 members in the group, then leaving services messages will be disabled

Everything you need to know about Telegram privacy in one picture;21;ijbrow;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/1q470mf4t4k51.png;24;;2020-08-30 15:15:49;"Once a group or a lot of messages are flagged for pornography or other abuses, the contents are checked (I don't know if it's done by an algorithm) and the group is eventually taken down. Also, under certain circumstances, if the police requests it, groups and users can be banned. Telegram is not a dark web forum, it's an app open to all customers on all platforms for free, and they have to respect the platform rules (for example, porn channels are not available to iOS users but they are to Android users because of the different rules in the App store and Google Play store). It's not like they read all your messages and choose to nuke your chat, there needs to be a legal reson. There are two types of Groups .. Public ones if message is reported then checked by telegram then marked as what is seen in photo.. If some spammer spammed your group contact telegram support to remove warning.. First read telegram [TOS](https://telegram.org/tos) and [privacy policy](https://telegram.org/privacy). Then the following remarks:

1. [Channels](https://telegram.org/faq_channels?ln=f#q-how-are-public-and-private-channels-different) and [public groups](https://telegram.org/faq?ln=f#q-what-makes-telegram-groups-cool): accessible by everyone, including telegram.
2. Channels and semi-public groups (private, but with invitation link): accessible by invitation from the creator (for private channels [only the first 200 users](https://telegram.org/faq_channels?ln=f#q-what-can-administrators-do)) or by invitation link, telegram can access them.
3. Private groups (no invitation link): accessible by invitation from group administrators, telegram cannot access them.

So telegram deletes contents that violates TOS. Is the screenshot related to the last category? This is the only one that counterdicts their FAQ reported in your screenshot. It doesn't snoop in private groups. If you report a message or some private channel or group, the message is forwarded to moderators. When any message is forwarded, it's viewable to all. True man, thats what i thought when i got a copyright claim in a private group and in a private channel This is a bit alarming since right from the start, Telegram Messenger does NOT process requests of takedown of private groups and chats, regardless if its pornography or a copyright issue.

That only applies to public channels.

I know iOS users are banned from entering in porn channels because of Apple’s policy but still, there are some porn channels that I am able to view despite that restriction.

However the key discussion here is that even if reported, Telegram Messenger should not touch private groups. [deleted] > **Al**l Telegram chats and **group** chats are private amongst their participants > **Al**l Telegram chats and **group** chats are private amongst their participants So, ToS and PP are different from FAQ You would never know because their source isn’t open... Get signal! An example of this? It doesn't snoop in private groups. If you report a message or some private channel or group, the message is forwarded to moderators. When any message is forwarded, it's viewable to all. *All* Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.

Learn to read, kid I read ""All Telegram chats and GROUP chats are private amongst their participants"". Please before to post the same message many times ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ijbrow/everything_you_need_to_know_about_telegram/g3d21gz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ijbrow/everything_you_need_to_know_about_telegram/g3d60af?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). No, you did not read them properly.

The [FAQ](https://telegram.org/faq#q-there-39s-illegal-content-on-telegram-how-do-i-take-it-down) clearly states that telegram deletes any public content (groups with link, channels or bots) not private one.

*All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them. But* ***sticker sets***\*,\* ***channels***\*, and\* ***bots*** *on Telegram are publicly available.* Buddy, I am from Telegram. I know how it works. We never snoop on any user data. Recently i made a private group to share the episodes of rick and morty but everytime i shared an episode there was a copyright strike and a message from telegram to remove the episode and if not removed the group will be banned [deleted] [deleted] Again, no way to tell. Your word doesn’t prove anything.. But they claim that they don't process request about GROUP CHATS. G R O U P CHATS.
G

P so groups are channels? Or bots? Or maybe stickers? Groups and group chats are the exact same thing. You are thinking of channels To you, perhaps not. [deleted] No. It's a bit personal for me"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/i6ldk7/q_can_i_enable_nsfw_on_iphone/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf On IOS telegram can't show you nsfw chats due to apple rules, you can go around it by using the web client in safari I don't see the problem here. Telegram is giving you a huge favor. Use Nicegram Wow, nobody else knows?

There's a setting on the desktop and web versions of Telegram, and it's under privacy or something like that. Look for something about sensitive content. Flip it. No more censorship. I haven't seen that message in mine in a couple years. Can you pm me chanel link You cant, bro If this is on iOS, you can always is nicegram, which is yet another client that uses the telegram API and it's safe to use. They bypass that restriction without any issues. except suggesting to look for another hentai chan that’s not banned ^ this That's so dumb...Apple should also ban web browsers too, by that logic. Join the dark side, comrade They kinda already do in a way, all web browsers apps on IOS are just safari skins, Apple won't allow apps to actually use other browsers engines (like chrome's and Firefox's) Is chrome on iOS a safari skin too? Wait what Yup! Basically Chrome on iOS is like Safari with a Google theme. Wait, it's all safari? ""always has been"" Yea. All browsers on iPhones and iPads need to have WebKit. That is why Chrome and Firefox can't give their users their full experience on these platforms since they can't use their own engines. *points gun*"

Is there a way to export;10;iikecq;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/iikecq/is_there_a_way_to_export/;23;[removed];2020-08-29 05:10:07;"...what exactly are you trying to do? 

what are “telegram articles” and if you’ve already exported them, why do you need to export them again? Do you mean you exported them to saved messages?, select all of them and export them to a group and export them from that group with a bot as IFTTT or something. The ""Telegram"" articles are in reality Medium articles downloaded to the Telegram app. I export articles from Medium to the Telegram app. I want to export all of them but there's no way (at least I see) to export them Because the Medium app only gives you 3 free articles per month only and by doing it like this it's a hack. The Medium app it's a really great app with curated articles however you only get 3 free articles and then you have to pay to read them and this hack allows you to download all the articles to the Telegram app and they always open without having to pay. Install the Medium app and share articles to Telegram and then try to export them, and you'll notice there's no way 😲 I don't really know what you mean, I only use telegram to export medium articles, I don't know anything else about the app oh, you mean the IV pages? don’t think there’s a way to “export” them, but they’re stored on Telegram’s servers. How did you export them? What steps did you perform for this? Telegram isn't unique in being able to get medium articles.

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/medium-unlimited-read-for-free/ I've never heard of the IV pages, but doesn't seem like it. I mean what I download to my phone from Medium that if shared from the Medium app is stored somewhere in my phone, because I've opened these downloaded articles and they open even without internet access. Just share them once they say that you can't read them anymore and that you need a membership to continue reading, at the bottom there's the share bottom, I just press it and I share it with Telegram. And after I share it and the article finished downloading (it only takes seconds) just open it up and the entire article is there. I do everything Internet related in my Android phone so it's not really an option unless there's other ways in Android well, IV is what is used when you click on the button below the article that says “instant view”. cool feature, allows you to read websites within the Telegram app. it might be cached on your device, but it’s not in a format where you can export and easily view them Please read this: https://instantview.telegram.org/ Oh okay but then why do you need to export from telegram when you can just read them in telegram? Right, that's what I'm talking about! But only because when I clean the cache for the app and evn shut my phone off and turne it back on, even without internet access, I conclude it's somewhere downloaded, but yes that's been my conclusion that there's no way to export that unless I find the folder where it dowoads but I've searched thoroughly in all the app folders and I have no idea where they're stored. For a number of reasons:
1- Convenience. I have so many downloaded articles and unfortunately there's no way for me to not only search for the article but I don't know how many articles I have, the titles of the articles, who wrote the article or what channel the article was posted to and when the articles were published. It's not only inconvenient but almost impossible to scroll all the way to the top.

2- Organization. I just simply love order and it's really stressful having different topics mixed together with no power to control them.

3- ⌚ Time. I might be repeating myself but I find so much waste of time to scroll 📜 up 👆 having to read every single title that by the time I have found my article I'm just tired of reading and don't want to read it.
 And
4- Peace of mind, if for any reason something happens to my phone 📱 or the app and need to reinstall or erese the app data I'm 'screwed.' It's taken me so many weeks and months gathering this articles that it would be a tragedy to loose them. It would be catastrophic and there's no way to back them up.

Why do you ask? Are you going to come up with the solution. Please do, be my guest. I know I could do an app to do this but I don't have time and truth be told the know how. If you're up for the task and create an app please do just give me a free premium version and I'll be real happy and conformed but don't think I don't know the money behind a app that really solve a problem, I REALLY DON'T have the time, know how or interest in making money this way. Please let me know if you or anyone has a solution I'll greatly appreciate it!!! 🙏 it's not in a specific folder, it's in the app data. again, not easily extracted and assembled to be viewable outside the app. 

but you can check the app source on GitHub if you want to find where IV stuff is cached to You clearly gain a lot from these articles. Why don't you just pay for a subscription? Thanks so much, I know what github is, but I only know html and CSS and github is programmers which I'm not I'm an amaerican  but I'm stranded in Mexico and in a nutshell for money reasons for the last 9 months I've been earning pesos and what I earn is barely enough to survive on food, rent and mess. Secondly I've probably read from all I've downloaded 2 or 3 articles I've downloaded them hoping to use them in research in the future but truth be told that's why they're so valuable because I haven't read them hoping one day on the near future I can continue my life in the US which soon I'll be back to. Fair enough. Good luck!"

In the Beta version of Telegram for macOS, the global search has been supported by media type filter.;191;ihvnao;Telegram;https://v.redd.it/m04l4xu9lmj51;9;[deleted];2020-08-28 02:03:08;"This could be a response to the similar WhatsApp functionality that will be coming? (Which is also a response to Telegram's filtering of Media, Files, etc). Why do they keep developing a macos specific client?

why not focus on the cross-platform desktop app?

I'm even struggling to believe that they have more mac users than users from other platforms like windows or even linux What is that sign right next to the search bar on the right? I also have the beta version installed but never seen it So they chose to add more functionality instead of fixing a long existing bug that makes search completely useless for ALL Chinese, Japanese, Korean. Cool. I guess in this case competition does bring innovation. If only WhatsApp innnovated at the same pace lol. As a Mac user I love it :) They reuse a lot of code from the iOS version Are you MacOS user ? because I guess this beta feature is for Mac OS . Yeah I am that’s why I am asking"

Telegram v Signal - encrypted chats across devices;10;ihfswv;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ihfswv/telegram_v_signal_encrypted_chats_across_devices/;24;"I love most everything about Telegram, but use Signal instead. The reason is this: On Signal, I can share private/encrypted chats across devices (iPhone, iPad, Macbook). As I understand it, on Telegram, private chats are exclusive to one device. Only non-private chats are accessible across devices.

Is my understanding accurate? If not, how do I access private Telegram chats across devices?";2020-08-27 09:10:46;"Signal does not have multi device support at all. There is no sync. You simply (like whatsapp) access your mobile via the other clients. Its more like a Remote Desktop tool ;)

Telegram private chats are bound to your device, because the encryption key don't leaves the device. See this as a security feature, as secure key exchange is tough one. But yes, this feature would be cool. Signal sucks Signal advantages: E2EE all chats.

Telegram advantages: everything else. You are right. Don't listen to telegram fanboys.
Signal chats and calls are E2EE and can be used across all devices. You don't need to keep your phone on to use full version of Signal on desktop It's actually a weakness to distribute secure chats across devices.    The device is the weakest point of any E2E chat.     Esp they way Signal 'stacks up' the messages for delivery when said device is turned on.    Having several devices able to connect to a secret chat is bad.     Depending on threat model of course. I don't think this is the case (at least anymore). Once initially setup, you can use signal on desktop independently of your phone. When someone messages you, two messages are sent, one encrypted to the phone and one encrypted to the other device. It is true multidevice, e2ee. Nope. The Signal/WA web clients are basically other devices to which you forward each message you receive.
So the private keys don't leave your device (and due to the protocol, it wouldn't even matter that much because chats older than this connection would still be secure and chats after it too). Maybe Signal is a bad example but what about Keybase?? That's E2EE in multiple devices. Yes and Yes and Yes and yes! Agree. True. But Signal's desktop app takes forever to open up after a system reboot. Atleast on my Linux. Not sure to understand. If the message is forwarded without the key, the message isn’t secure? So the result is the same for both Telegram and Signal ? That's because of PFS encryption. It decrypts messages one-by-one. That's how encrypted messaging works The message is decrypted on your phone and then encrypted again (on your phone) with the key you share with your PC, just like if you copied the text you received (with end to end encryption between your friend's phone and your phone) and pasted it into another chat with your PC.
At least that's what we were told in our real world crypto engineering class.

So it's forwarded with a _different_, fresh key that's shared between your phone and your PC. Does it mean its better to delete long conversations in the phone before I open up the desktop clients? I remember waiting for almost ten minutes at times. No. It will not help, phone and desktop have separate decryption keys Oh shucks. What about Telegram's desktop app? How secure is it? That's questionable. No end-to-end encryption support in desktop client, all data stored on Telegram servers, a lot of metadata sent to servers. Personally I don't trust Telegram * Windows desktop client.     MAC OS desktop has E2E. Agreed. But I'm more curious about how secure telegram is on desktop. Is it safe enough to use at say, a company desktop? Yes, also Pidgin plugin has E2E It depends on your threat model"

There is a Bot called @SpamBot, which gives you info about the limitation, and also its expiration date, but no reason why I was limited in the first place. Maybe this has changed, I dont know.

It's not really possible to tell exactly the limits, this is just my observation. Yeah, the bot just said that someone didn’t like what I sent them, or that I might have spammed(which I did not)"

I wrote a script which sets Telegram account info with fake profile data and AI generated user photo.

Hope you could put it for good use. 

https://github.com/nedlir/telegram-randomizer

Edit: The script can now also determine the gender in the profile photo. 

Please use it only for good! 😀";2020-08-24 22:11:45;"A yes, another way for spambots to be even more arbitrary xD

Jokes aside, nice idea :D im sorry im noob at coding this and this  


how to use it ?  


because i cannot find explanation on yo repo  


btw this is a great idea ! Nice! Though I have some notes:

1. I don't see any sex check in your code, so there might be male name/surname with female avatar
2. I think you can merge ""get\_first\_name()"" and ""get\_last\_name()"" functions into one. Something like ""get\_name\_part(data, name=True)"" Thank you /u/groosha for the notes!

The script can now distinct between male and female AI generated photos as well. 😁 So I don't need to signup with my phone number to use telegram with your script?🙄 The purpose of the code is to maintain user anonymity.

It is not applicable for bots. First of all you need to [download latest version of python] (https://www.python.org).

Then you should pip install the requirements.txt file, you could find an elaborate guide on how to do it [here] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7225900/how-to-install-packages-using-pip-according-to-the-requirements-txt-file-from-a). 

Finally, sign up for [Telegram API service] (https://core.telegram.org/). 

Make sure to replace the 'api_hash' and 'api_id' parameters with your own.

Hope that helps :) You are right, I will add gender recognition. 

The dividing between first and last name was written that way on purpose since telegram requires those as two separate parameters. 

Thank you for your input, appreciate the feedback! Thank you /u/groosha for the notes!

The script can now distinct between male and female AI generated photos as well. I'm not sure I understood your question, but you must have an active telegram account that you can implement the script on. Maybe I should've worded that better.

There are a fuckton of accounts/people out there who utilize a userclient like you do to generate accounts and spam groups with all kinds of spam and scam attempts.

I don't know what kind of groups you frequent, but I'm in enough big groups to see that kinda spam on the daily.

Those automated accounts is what I meant by spambots. They're still bots, after all. How is it better than simply leaving everything blank? Photo is not required, for example. Do I lose my original account if I use it? >The dividing between first and last name

Yeah, I know. I mean, both functions are almost identical except required key. You can easily pass that key to function call and avoid unnecessary code duplication. Then you can call your function twice passing ""first"" and then ""last"" as keys to get from ""data"". You're welcome! Must have a valid username You could retrieve your old data, just make sure to back it up.

This will change your user name, profile description, profile first and last name and profile photo. You're right, I will have to commit those changes :) You don't need to set a username. Only first name is required."
Is there any pattern or specific reason why telegram would delete your account without giving any warning or reason;5;ifsx3s;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ifsx3s/is_there_any_pattern_or_specific_reason_why/;9;[removed];2020-08-24 19:59:42;"you probably forwarded a message that got caught in Telegram’s spam filter, or you changed your name/profile picture to impersonate Telegram/saved messages. 

or your phone number range was part of a range used by spammers, and Telegram banned the entire range? i haven’t heard of that in a while though. 

you can always tweet to twitter.com/telegram and ask them what’s up. they did manage to delete a bunch of accounts a while back by accident, but they were able to recover and help anybody who was affected quite quickly. recover@telegram.org It happened to me a few years ago, no idea why. [deleted] [deleted] This makes more sense but why let someone create account with banned phone number if they gone ban it later. I can assure it was just my phone Bro I was literally in the middle of talking to someone they don't. if the number is banned, anybody can get it unbanned How when you try to log in, it’ll give you a pop up saying your number is banned, with an option to click “help” or “close”

clicking help will open up an email form that’s prefilled (if you use an app like Gmail) with a phone number, device info, and a small blurb asking to be unbanned. you can add more info and send that off. 

not sure if that will restore any data that was on the account though. hence why i recommended you ask TG on Twitter, as they can do that if your acc was deleted by accident"

How to default-lock new Version of Telegram?;19;if1fxk;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/if1fxk/how_to_defaultlock_new_version_of_telegram/;8;"Hello 😉
I have been using Telegram for a long time now. I recently upgraded to the new version. I used to have a setting enabled which locked Telegram by default on my phone. So if I closed the app and tried to open it again it would be automatically locked by my pin. Now I can only find options that will lock telegram after a certain period of time. Where can I find the option that Telegram will lock itself once it's closed or not actively being used? Does this option still excist? This was so super useful!!";2020-08-23 14:13:35;"I don't remember such option in ""vanilla"" Telegram for Android. The minimum option was ""1 minute"".

On the other hand, Telegram X for Android (alternative, but still official app) does have ""instant lock"" option. Hit the lock when exiting Telegram, that insta-locks the app.

It's not auto-lock per say I know..

(Should you be on a OnePlus you could add the app to the list of locked apps also. Maybe other OS's have this option to?)



https://ibb.co/jD88vGz TGX is not official. There is only one official app. This You're wrong. Telegram X for Android is official. Proof: [https://telegram.org/apps#telegram-database-library-tdlib](https://telegram.org/apps#telegram-database-library-tdlib) and [https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x](https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x). 

You can also ask Telegram in Twitter, though they've commented several times on this: [https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1243181234282471424](https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1243181234282471424) Just because Telegram featured X, that makes it official? Oof. If it's not under the same developer, it's not official. And where have you seen a web entity with 2 or more official apps? X is just an alternate client, much like Reddit has Boost, Facebook has Maki, etc. But not ""official"". From the official [telegram blog](https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x):

> ...we started relying on **internal competition** to feed our flames. This is why for the last two years we've been developing a new generation of Telegram clients in parallel with the main versions.

> The Telegram X project features apps written from scratch, with an entirely new code base and without all the legacy components that our older apps have accumulated through the years.

To improve upon themselves they started developing a new version internally. They specifically say that this is officially made by them. I don't know what other proof you need I suggest asking Telegram in Twitter and they will confirm you that Telegram X for Android is an official app from one of Telegram devs. It's a first-party app, not third-party like Plus Messenger.

If it's not enough for you, well, feel free to doubt. Have a nice day!"

I feel like the easyness of Netflix makes it worth 10 bucks. I can just yell at my google home and it starts playing on the tv in a second rather than fiddle with telegram channel. I always used telegram for new video or Movie. Anybody have any telegram links? I couldn't agree more ""a streaming platform or a streaming platform?""
""a chat app""

make sense... no one of the TG channel provide a real quality movie or anim they all scam and rederict you to other channel Channels posting pirated movies and shows on telegram. Recommend a channel please can you recommend a channel? Just global search Where *caugh* to get to those *caugh caugh* channels *caugh*? I was really surprised this is a thing. I wonder how their servers manage to hold this much data. I’ve probably uploaded hundreds of gigabytes of media myself over my telegram usage experience. Wooo My source of entertainment! @ nexcc yeah Cough? Or caught? Search for *Intermedia Network*, go to the TV Updates in the channel and search for your shows title. /r/TelegramChannels for starters… This exact thing has got me wondering about whether I should continue to place my trust on telegram. Pavel seems like a privacy favoring guy, but how all this is being funded, even if telegram is truly not for profit, is just beyond me. I'm wondering about the same thing... Lmao Whoops, meant the former Taken down for copyright infringement it says. Thanks! >Intermedia Network

As I know, Pavel is a billionaire. And he is funding it. I think it runs on commercial ads. There is actually ton of it and obviously tg devs get a share. Although there is a metric ton of anti-spam measures and bots without them even smallest groups quickly overflow with spam bots. Quarantine him!!! iOS? I know that's the official story, but I don't see how or why he would keep on burning cash like that. It's been 7 years since Telegram started, with no monetization or even donation program in sight. I have never seen any ads. Can you tell me where the ads show up? Alright, you cought me Android. [deleted] 😷💀 If I were a billionaire I would donate too"

Telegram and Whatsapp doubt;24;idmexw;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/idmexw/telegram_and_whatsapp_doubt/;20;"Hello! I'll start saying that I don't know if this sub is the right one to ask but please help me 😅

I had WA when it started many years ago but I deleted it when it was bought from Facebook, I did it cause my concerns about privacy online. After some time I've discovered Telegram and it's exactly the messaging app I was looking for.
The problem is, at work my team is asking me to install WA so that I can join the 'work group chat', none of them use Telegram and want to install it cause WA has more users...
One of the team told me that last year WA changed to give privacy to users and that messages use endtoend encryption and that now is ""safe"" to use it! 
Is there anyone who can tell me if now I could join WA as well and don't worry that what I text / send will not be saved in some server?
Thank you!";2020-08-21 03:27:49;"Nothing related to Facebook guarantees privacy, ask them to join Telegram has many more tools to work, security and privacy.
Thousands of links were recently leaked to join WhatsApp groups that were supposed to be private, all with a simple search with the Google browser. Anything related to Facebook is neither safe nor private.

Don’t believe all the bullshit and hype. Facebook will never run any type of service without some form of income generating through it.

Telegram Messenger is ad free. It doesn’t datamine users and is packed with more features that will put your mind at ease. 

Telegram has a 2GB upload limit, both compressed and uncompressed.

That alone puts Zuckerbook in the dust. Facebook is bridging the backends so that instagram and Messenger are now completely melded. They've said they are working to do the same with WhatsApp. You can't trust WhatsApp's encryption for one simple reason: it's closed-source and Facebook might have the decryption keys. Other messaging apps with E2E are open-source so people can review the code and check that it's all safe. WhatsApp does not have that.

Plus, Telegram groups are much better in my opinion. They can hold more people, you can share work files, there's bots and stuff for moderation and scheduled and pinned messages for reminders and announcements. no doubt, telegram.   
besides privacy, but also app design, ui, ux, cross platform support, storage.... WA uses Signal's E2E encryption method (which people generally regard as safe) so if you're worried about people snooping on your messages, I think you'll be fine. 

that being said, metadata is not encrypted. instead it's retained and sent to Facebook so they can push ads in the status (stories) section, or do whatever with, which is a big concern. plus, if you use it on mobile and decide you want to backup your chats, it backs it up unencrypted on iCloud (iOS) or Google Drive (Android). 

not to mention, WhatsApp accounts can only be used on one device at a time (can be used on desktop but it requires your phone to be connected to the internet). Telegram accounts can be used on multiple devices at a time (on a company computer, phone, iPad, etc) independently, without having to rely on a single device. 

that being said, Telegram doesn't have E2E encryption by default like WhatsApp does (because then cloud chats, their main selling point, wouldn't work). nor does it have E2E encryption for group chats. I deleted wa a couple weeks ago. Why? I was chatting with my friend about wrist watches.  Next day my friend called me and asked me if I get advertisements about wrist watches. And yes , I get advertisements about certina wrist watches , exactly the same that we talked about. So I deleted wa account right away. In my company they using wa group chat for the infos. And now I’m refusing to use this. The fact that you can open up your message on WhatsApp on any device and it syncs, shows the end-to-end encryption *can be* decrypted at some point (But that's why it backs up! ... So where is it backing up your data? Again, if it can be decrypted via backups, it can be decrypted in general). Telegram is defaulted to no encryption, but the private chats, as far as I'm aware are linked to the device, so therefore unable to be opened on your phone/desktop/laptop at the same time. [deleted] [deleted] [removed] Actually, e2e encryption only exists in personal chats and 1:1 calls, for [efficiency reasons](https://invidio.us/watch?v=Q0_lcKrUdWg&dark_mode=true&autoplay=1). If one wanted to create a group chat with N participants with e2e encryption, each participant would have to send N-1 messages to the other users (unfeasible for messages with ""heavy"" files of just 10 MByte).

Signal requires several trusts in the server.

1. Signal is e2e only in chats and 1:1 calls, but not in groups (does not support group calls at the moment). In groups each participant shares its own symmetric encryption key with all the others and in this way it is not necessary to send N-1 messages, but only a message to the server where it is delivered to the recipients. Groups are not e2e. In the past this has led to some security problems [link](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/01/10/attack-of-the-week-group-messaging-in-whatsapp-and-signal/). Note: signal is developing a new protocol for [group management](https://signal.org/blog/signal-private-group-system/) which should solve the problem of authentication.
2. Signal, like almost all communication services, is [Trust On First Use (TOFU)](https://keybase.io/blog/chat-apps-softer-than-tofu). This means that if you do not verify the identity of the sender you are communicating with, through his fingerprint in the settings, you are trusting the server (no one guarantees the absence of an [MITM attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)). In a group of N people, you have to verify N-1 identity, is it feasible especially if users are scattered around the world? No, not even with small N and not even if you live in the state or city sometimes.
3. Signal has introduced PIN and SVR functions, which in short are needed to support username (avoid sharing the phone number) and to be able to transfer your user's backup between different devices and for reinstallations. At the moment PIN and SVR only allow you to transfer contacts and settings, but in the future also chats. PIN and SVR move your data from your phone to the cloud improving usability, but invalidating e2e encryption. You have to trust the signal managers who can access your data due to the faulty implementation of SVR [link](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/07/10/a-few-thoughts-about-signals-secure-value-recovery/). After several protests, the PIN from mandatory has become optional. However, the problem remains: if you keep it disabled and therefore no cloud backup, but only one of the participants in a group of N people keeps it active, the group's chats end up in the cloud.
4. Signal forces you to share your phone number because it does not support usernames. This allows [government attacks](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/hongkong-protests-protesters/) through ISPs that allow to obtain the identity of the owner (even telegram had the same problem, [corrected](https://telegram.org/blog/scheduled-reminders-themes#new-privacy-settings) after one month from the abuse of Hong Kong).

Whatsapp has the same problems of signal and the following two:

1. Closed source applications and obfuscated binaries: nobody but the developers know what the application really does. No one can guarantee that the application will save a clear copy without encryption somewhere. Also, you can't verify that it actually uses the signal protocol.
2. Chats backups on third-party servers: the backups are in plain text so that in case of a device change or reinstallation, you can access the content of your chats (otherwise it would not be possible and you would need something like the signal PIN). Facebook, google and apple can access your chats and that's why whatsapp backups don't take up space in your gdrive or icloud accounts. As with signal, if you keep the backup disabled, the problem remains in group chats where one member that enables it, is enough to invalidate e2ee. I would add that even if you don’t want to backup your chats, if one of your contact or someone in a group chat does, then your messages will stil be backed up in iCloud or Google Drive. > that being said, metadata is not encrypted

From their technical white paper, WhatsApp's metadata is in-fact, [encrypted](https://scontent.whatsapp.net/v/t39.8562-34/89275998_627986927772871_4167828889579552768_n.pdf?_nc_sid=2fbf2a&_nc_ohc=7gRYhAD5hrgAX8sdDcA&_nc_ht=scontent.whatsapp.net&oh=88dc3c4baf7d6da13d7b96c242f2ae21&oe=5FA80D51#page=11).

> Encrypts metadata to hide it from unauthorized network observers.
No information about the connecting user’s identity is revealed. I hadn't logged into facebook for over a year, I never received any of those spam/scam calls about car insurance, home insurance etc. For the whole year, I even checked my call history to double check this after the fact.

&#x200B;

I *HAD* to login to facebook messenger for a client, instead of using a new account, I foolishly used my old account which still has my mobile linked. I chatted with the client for a bit and that was that, the next day I was getting marketing calls, 2-5 a day, for a month, from the same numbers, I kept blocking them, and more would pop up, I guess after a month the number got flagged as inactive or not answering and the calls started diminishing to like 1 a week. I'm ~~not~~ now sitting at 0 calls for about 4 months now.

&#x200B;

I'd bet you my life savings that if I logged into facebook right now and faffed about for an hour or so, I'd start getting called again.

&#x200B;

Edit: A word. My friend had the same thing happening to them and we were only talking about the specific thing on telegram. It was a bit weird to hear that from them. This no « no reason » and work should not force you to use any messaging app. I would rather trust Durov with my data who went out of his way to spend his own money with no way of regenerating that income back just to provide a safe, secure platform of communication.

Granted Signal is a good alternative, I’ll still switch to Telegram."

But that is good news! It’s a virtual camera (Camo App, more specifically) that I use to have mi iPhone as the webcam. Would you know how to set that up as the default camera on MacOS? Highly appreciate it. You can turn the notification off for ""contacts joined in telegram"" in notification settings And also stop syncing contacts, this is what will actually make you stop receiving that notification Unfortunately I don't have any experience with MacOS. Another idea is to somehow disable that unwanted primary camera. No problem. Thanks anyway!"

Send media to chat via bot;12;ic0r22;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ic0r22/send_media_to_chat_via_bot/;10;[removed];2020-08-18 16:13:59;"https://t.me/Reddit_Mirrors Why do you even scrape the subreddit data ?  Reddit has its own public api available to fetch any subreddit data. Whatever language you are familiar with search a reddit api wrapper for it on github. ( eg. Snoowrap - a node js wrapper ) Not telegram bot solution: Have you tried ifttt? It is quite flexible for setting up custom scenarios. Do you know any programming language? Python, php js...

If you can scrap the subreddit send media to a channel is pretty easy and explained in the api documentation I have been working on something similar. So I will explain in a bit more detail  


You can use the Telegram API for sending the data, have a look at [this](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sending-files). Most of the time there are wrappers around API available as Open-source since they are better-rounded and handles edge cases, it is better to use these. For eg for Python, there is the [telepot](https://telepot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) wrapper, I would say the only disadvantage is the steep learning curve.

For getting media from Reddit, we can either simply use the Reddit API or a Python wrapper like [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get the media. This should be fairly easy, except for the case of videos, as Reddit stores the video and audio of files separately, so you have to combine them together.

As for scheduling, you could either run the server all the time and check for the time and run this or if you are running this on a Unix based machine then look into cron jobs.

Also, Bash is a powerful language when we have to interact with the filesystem, but when we have to use the web, it might probably become way too complex and unreadable. So I think it is always better to use something like Python in this case.

If you have any more doubts ask away If it possible, I'd prefer some py/go solution, to be able make custom changes. Just a little know python and go (can read the code and make some changes inside), but can't write own. one of my first python steps was a Telegram bot that scrapes a webpage, is quite confusing for a begginer but very grateful, you can use a tutorial of requests and beautiful soup, there are tons on the internet and maybe about reddit (I don't know if you can scrap new reddit using request (because it probably use a lot of js), maybe you have to go to the old html reddit), For the bot use python_telegram_bot API and it's documentation, for the schedule you can use Cron (I'm supposing you have something like a raspberry to run this). +1 on this API. 

Makes really easy and mostly intuitive once you get the hang of Telegram's API. It will make for a very good personal project with well-defined goals."

A question about 'new user' notification;2;ibxe3u;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ibxe3u/a_question_about_new_user_notification/;5;"Hello everyone,

My question is NOT about how to stop receiving this, it is about how to avoid sending this to every user who has your phone number saved in their Contacts. How to prevent this from happening after you register? I don’t want anybody to be notified that I've just became a user.

Regarding the facts that

a) the registration process is very simple & almost optionless and

b) the app is gonna ask you at some point to 'synch' your Contacts,

I assume that my question could have something to do with the latter. Will saying no to the 'syncing' question resolve my problem?";2020-08-18 11:53:12;"This is been asked several times. I even posted my own experience where I had a phone contact 4 years ago that I deleted and blocked in my phone because he abused me. A couple months ago when I downloaded the app he got a notification that I was on telegram and he sent me a message before I had a chance to set up my privacy, because he still had my phone number. 
Sure, I can go through the process of blocking him so that he can't text me anymore but it was a painful memory to re-live simply because I downloaded a fucking app. I'm not sure about this, but I guess you can make your account with another number, then go change your privacy settings, then change number to your desired number 

Another usefull tip: If you set ""Who can see my phone number?"" to Nobody before changing your number, then nobody will see your new number From what I know, right now, there's no option to cancel this. It happens on their side not your side. If they have your number telegram assumes they are interested to know you're on telegram. Only they can disable this notification. Then don’t share your number with anyone.

Honestly I don’t really see the problem with this feature. I like being informed which of my contacts joined Telegram. If you don’t want Telegram telling your friends you just joined Telegram, then just do not give out your number to people. Period."

This is a known issue and one of the main reason why many switch to WhatsApp after a couple of days.
Are you using any group or super group?

EDIT:
But why do people downvote me for reporting personal experience that is more of a feedback than anything else? Am really curious to know. Can't open it, internal server error These won’t solve the problem in the long run.
And asking no technical users to go through all these process is a bad sign. Let alone the fact that other IM don’t need to go into all these nonsense settings. No it's just normal chat. Saved you bro like an angle ᕙ(  • ‿ •  )ᕗ Try again, it is the official telegram FAQ. Right, you could ask to smartphone providers to not block telegram. It is not a question of programming, but of default permissions. As telegram MAU grows, the smartphone providers will set the right permissions. I’d suggest you to join a super group mute the notifications for it and observe if notifications will be more reliable or not . So does this mean  smartphone provider who explicitly block Telegram?

I'm asking because the other instant messenger applications I installed doesn't have this issue at all. Yes you are right. Usually, the majority of not famous applications have usage restrictions (aggressive battery monitor or notifications, especially on huawei and xiamoi devices).

Which one? But Telegram is really popular, If not the most popular besides WhatsApp. And it even comes pre-installed in many smartphones. 

And why would they block it in the first place? There must be a good reason if they do.


> Which one?

WhatsApp, Discord, Line, Slack, ICQ etc... Telegram is becoming popular this year with [400 M MAU](https://telegram.org/blog/400-million). Which smartphones preinstall it?

They block all unpopular applications to save battery life and avoid too many notification. I know that many old huawei with android 6-8, always block them. I can understand those ""save battery life"" feature specially on smartphone like Huawei etc... but the issue am talking was very frequent to contact using iPhone and Samsung.

> Telegram is becoming popular this year with 400 M MAU.

It has always been popular actually.
At one point, almost ALL my contact installed Telegram but Telegram delete their account automatically within 3 months if they don't open the app (now six months), even if the app is still runnning on the phone.

> Which smartphones preinstall it?

Many Android devices... >I can understand those ""save battery life"" feature specially on smartphone like Huawei etc... but the issue am talking was very frequent to contact using iPhone and Samsung.

This is very strange. If you followed the link that I reported in my first post, it should work. Otherwise you can contact telegram support.

>It has always been popular actually. At one point, almost ALL my contact installed Telegram but Telegram delete their account automatically within 3 months if they don't open the app (now six months), even if the app is still runnning on the phone.

Telegram entered into top ten of most used app for the first time last month.

You can select the deletion time up to 12 months. This is a security measure if you drop your phone number and it get assigned to a new user.

>Many Android devices...

I installed telegram on many devices, but I had problem just with huawei and xiaomi. > This is very strange. If you followed the link that I reported in my first post, it should work. Otherwise you can contact telegram support.

I'll try to suggest this to contacts next time they have notification issue."

If there were great or even good channels, they'd be posted. If they're secret, they're either not that good, or not that legal. Think about it… Wow! Thanks! Quite useful. 

Shame it's not an official resource though.    
Not clear if the list is comprehensive or up to date. Never thought about it but maybe something like the stickers section or similar. That is something I really want to be added. Cause a lot people who are new to the platform can’t find content without using other resources. And also it will help to boost actually good channels. There are a lot of verified channels....

They can mark you by using your Profile-Name. for example ur ID is Hidden so Telegram will show your Profile Name instead. If someone harrass you then u can block those people. Its not possible to stay un marked. If someone do that then leave group or kick the people if you are an Admin in that group. Thats the only thing i know so far. you cant hide usernames group admins are visible to all who can access said group Profile name, username, and avatar are all public information, don't have any private information in them if you interact with strangers (as opposed to only family/friends/professional) on Telegram.

If you're getting into privacy concerns, consider finding a texting service that doesn't require you to provide any personal information to join (or get a burner tracfone at the dollar store) and use that to register your (burner) number with Telegram. Then let anons say what they will, it won't come back to you. Actually in the group someone there mentioned my username, some people I don't have acces to their username and some I do, what does it when I leave the group ? Something will happen to the mention? What if I change my username? If I block the person and change my username will they still be able to see it? When u leave the group they cant see u anymore. yes"

Sounds like spam. Well, those groups are made of 2000 members, 200 sellers and 1800 costumers, so its like a competition who post faster and who post more of his products. So you want an advantage in automated posting. Won’t the people get annoyed seeing your product every ten seconds? Usually human don’t have such a short memory. The point is the people would chose the first thing that will see when they”ll open the group chat. And I’m not the only one that is using automated posting . Thats why i need a little help here.

[Other] Telegram has a major issue on iOS and they're refusing to address it;103;ib7w52;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ib7w52/other_telegram_has_a_major_issue_on_ios_and/;24;" Telegram's official iOS app is well-made. All the features are neatly tucked under the clean UI, media and network tasks work so well and I have never had any major issues with it. It follows the iOS design language very well. No complaints in that respect. There's a lot to learn from their app too. 

 But there is a major issue with the iOS client app that affects pretty much everyone. I can confirm it affects iOS 13 and 12 and doesn't affect iOS 10. The application runs a little too much in background. It uses a lot of energy in background leading to shorter battery life. In all of my testing, Telegram runs for hours in background if you use it for a couple of minutes and close it, sometimes 7 times more background activity than on-screen usage. Telegram is also aware of this issue. They just refuse to acknowledge it and address the issue in an update. 

From my understanding, it syncs messages in background and they're being a little too aggressive about it. I used to look at Telegram as everything a messaging app should be, but this is just against it. Nothing on my devices uses nearly as much energy as Telegram does. In all my friends' (friends who use Telegram) devices, Telegram is always on top of the battery usage statistics (sometimes even beats 3D games). WhatsApp also wakes up from background, decrypts messages and posts local notification, for every message it receives. WhatsApp also has to handle every message while it's in background. However, WhatsApp doesn't use half as much energy as Telegram does, even when WhatsApp is used much more than Telegram in a single charge cycle. They should at least make the background usage optional. I don't want Telegram to waste my battery syncing the messages in background. 

I want to send messages to people when I open the app and I want to receive notification. I'd gladly disable VoIP features if they're abusing VoIP APIs to run in background and they give me an option to disable it entirely. The app simply existing on my phone has become a bit of an issue for me now. I'll move to alternatives like Nicegram if Telegram continues to disregard such a serious issue. The github issue posted over a year ago is ignored, regardless of the activity in it. I've recently [tweeted to Telegram](https://twitter.com/ARX8x/status/1293211191871967235) asking about this issue but they're too busy responding to flattery and making fun of WhatsApp (I like that too but they're ignoring actual reports and criticism). 


github issue: https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS/issues/81";2020-08-17 08:03:34;"No wonder my iPhone has been draining battery like a mother lately.

I thought it was just me.

If this is indeed true, then this is indeed a VERY serious issue that Telegram devs need to address. I have background app refresh off here. Telegram works great and has used almost no background activity. In fact, I don't even notice that I have this off, so either all the apps I use are great at working around it or I just don't know what I'm missing. Hope they address this soon I noticed my battery life significantly reduce after installing Telegram the other week. I disabled background so refresh and the location services and that has definitely helped reduce the usage but it's still not great. I use it a lot on my iPhone XS Max, but I don't seem to have this issue. I'm on iOS 13.6.1. Big thing for me as well. Hm, thanks for flagging. I hadn't noticed this problem in terms of battery drain, but, having looked, you're correct that background use is about 5x that of actual app use. I have zero problems with telegram app on iPhone XS. It doesn’t drain my battery at all. On my wife’s iPhone XS the same. Doesn’t battery become affected by location services being on in the background? The app has a section mentioning this in the App Store. Yeah it's very bad, my iPad Pro has a standby time of a few days instead of weeks and it's often deep discharged because of telegram now. (I don't use it so often). And that is super bad for the battery as well as very annoying as it takes a while to start again after the deep discharge. I might uninstall Telegram from the ipad as i don't use it so often, it's that bad. its the same on my Samsung S7 Android.

Telegram is top consuming app.

Even with that after 2.5 years, original battery, lasts very long. So its not an issue for me. Telegram is so good.

I also have an iphone. Battery is utter crap. I don't use it.

Also IOS bans a lot of channels on telegram. IOS walled garden sucks [deleted] This isn't related to background app refresh. There are other APIs on iOS that let apps run in background. It could also have a connection with how many channels, groups and chats you have and how active they are. I've tried every ""user"" preferences and settings that I can access. They didn't address this for years. [Here's my battery usage](https://i.imgur.com/ERvvRNE.jpg) over the last 10 days. Telegram tops even Facebook. Me too ... all seems ok Telegram doesn’t use location in background unless you’re explicitly asking it to (live location and the other discovery feature). The system would show the location indicator if it actually uses location services anyway. That’s not the case. I don't use my phone a lot. My 6s has a dying battery and lasts only an hour. My iPhone X lasts 2 days or more (very light usage). We had a power outage for 48 hours due to heavy storm. Every bit of charge I can save mattered at that time. All my important contacts are on Telegram. Even without me using Telegram much, telegram used 50% of my battery during the power outage. It was under 1 hour screen-on usage and hours of background usage. It's then I started considering this as a serious issue and found out plenty of people had the same issue. There are situations where power consumption matters a lot. Besides, Telegram doesn't need to aggressively run background tasks if the user doesn't want it to. More power to the user. 

*Adding more RAM was never the solution to memory leaks* You can unlock the porn channels. Go to Settings and then Privacy and Security on the desktop and change the sensitive content setting.

It's kind of like Reddit in that way… [deleted] Very strange. I'm actually in a few really active groups so it has every reason to be pulling in messages often. I wonder what the difference is. I checked with CocoaTop and temporary background spawn, tried several settings in my app and didn't achieved any results in preventing telegram for work in background. If there's any daemon I could disable let me know Ah! Gotcha. Gotcha. I have noticed my battery draining faster but idk if that’s from the App (I don’t have locations/background activity turned on) or the phone being older (XS). I should look at my diagnostics to see if it’s possibly the App. [deleted] Have you looked at battery usage? I have background app refresh off as well. See what it says in terms of on-screen time vs background time. Telegram is the only app on my phone where background time is a multiple of on-screen time, instead of the other way around. > Because if you can't contribute, then don't complain.

I'm an open source developer. Please fucking complain if my libraries or software have a bug in them.

This is the MOST unhelpful comment out there. My Telegram has higher background than screen usage, but not by much. In the 10-day usage report it's been in background for about 1:45 and on-screen for just under an hour. It also only accounts for 1% of the report, but I acknowledge that for how much I use it that's a lot. I think the problem might be that it stays running for some time after being backgrounded, so someone who uses it sporadically throughout the day will notice some serious drainage and near constant background use."

Doth mine eyes deceive me? Did it finally happen after 10,000 years?;252;ia8rkm;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/xo6mi2mgk6h51.jpg;50;;2020-08-15 17:57:42;"Finally!!! All I need now is a friend I can video call! 7 yrs actually Quarantine made the team to do it Yes, it happened yesterday for Android users. iOS late to the game due to Apples restrictive attitude to developers. Gonna nitpick. Grammatically, the -th ending is the equivalent of the -s ending for verbs. It's for the singular third person (he, she, it). In Shakespearean English, it would be like this:

* I do
* Thou doest/dost* (singular you)
* He/she/it doth/doeth*
* We do
* Ye do (plural you)
* They do

And taken from Wiktionary:

>Doth and dost are generally used as auxiliary verbs; doeth and doest are generally used as main verbs.

(basically, ""doth he do that? He doeth what he doeth, question not"")

In your title, the eyes are ""they"". However, I know it's a meme and all that, so... Is it currently able to vidcall more than 2 people? Yes hahahha. Pre Alpha though, but it has finally arrived. It took forever to almost never happened Something good in 2020! I joined on beta briefly, but they finally rolled it out to a stable. So far, the video calling has been ""excellent"". Brilliant.

Might actually switch to Android next year. android app. updated. no video call yet. Hey, it’s cool bro!

I learn something new everyday! 😃 I believe they’re planning that on the next update. You invite your already existing friends and family to it.

You can also join communities. Isn't it due to sync support? [deleted] I don't think so unfortunately. I thought they were going to support group calls too but I guess not. They’re working on that on the next update coming this year. sobs inconsolably in the corner Lol bring them to telegram. I just deleted whatsapp. If someone wants to chat they should get telegram. I have brought 30 ppl so far to telegram and have over 200 Chats. My only friend who used telegram uninstalled it cause he didn't use it.

Edit: or Google Pixel I'm actually contemplating going over to iOS Buy google pixel, it has the best security and software support Really?

I've been Oneplus fan for years, however my next phone probably would be something else: [https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/08/05/oneplus-is-poisoning-its-phones-with-facebook-bloatware/](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/08/05/oneplus-is-poisoning-its-phones-with-facebook-bloatware/)

Fuck oneplus! Typing this on my oneplus 7. Don't buy a oneplus phone, they are not what they used to be. Even oxygenOS is gonna get bastardised now with Android 11. Do yourself a favor and buy Android with clean software. Possibly a Pixel. nah Oneplus has been going down the slippery slope since the Series 7. Too many phones. Less speedy updates. Higher price tags.

I'ma go for the Pixel 5 or 5A the next time. iOS is actually good but it’s rife with stupid beauracracy. Werid, I didn't get any bloatware on my phone. That's still better that Samsung.

Samsung installs Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, UBANK, Samsung Browser, Samsung Things, GEAR VR, Samsung Kids, Knox, Flipboard, and that's not even the full list

Edit: if you're rooted you can just remove Facebook I am on OnePlus 7T Pro, and everything is ok for me. However, I will not update to And 11, primarily because I am rooted, but also because they added bloatware and telemetry there. Yeah OnePlus and Pixel are the only phones I like, but I don't really like Pixel design It can be removed even without root if I'm not wrong. Only some of them, and only on some phones I thought you could remove whatever bloatware you want with ADB.

EDIT: Just read an article about it and yes it can be removed with ADB. Oh, that's what you mean. Yes you can do it with ADB, what I meant is that you can't remove them directly from your phone without root. Oh yeah, they don't even allow us to disable some apps."

Video Calls and Seven Years of Telegram;100;i9plpi;Telegram;https://telegram.org/blog/video-calls/;48;;2020-08-14 19:53:16;"Well, this is huge. I personally have several people that I can finally bring over since video calls were the only thing keeping them on WhatsApp. I think this might be the point where Telegram just starts snowballing even harder and becomes the most popular messenger in a year or two. Like, I literally can't imagine what else people will be asking for, considering that every tweet on their account was met with pleas for video calls. This is big and, if they keep up the release schedule with new features, will only get better. Yayyyy! Eggplant sticker!!! 🍆 Messed with me for a second since they were really focused on Android having it, but showing an iOS UI. This is the blog post I have been waiting for since 2017! 🎉🎉🎉 YAAAY!!!

P.S. Fuck you Tim Cook. A legendary day.

Mainly waiting for it to be on PC but this is the start of video-calling on Telegram. Can probably drop Discord for video-chatting in the future. Damn that peach emoji. Tried it, iphone - iphone for an hour yesterday, worked pretty much flawlessly, sound works well even if both people sort of talk into each other, video looked good although if you moved around it could mess up momentarily probably due to wifi.
Also could seamlessly switch from 4g to wifi, just a couple seconds to reestablish connection but nothing dropped off, same thing if i walked out of wifi reception and then back, it never dropped the call.
All the switching between picture in picture, swiping out of the call and into telegram to send a message, all those features worked perfectly, i didn't notice even a stutter.
The only thing that is likely a bug that i could find was if we both turned to landscape mode, one of us was upside down, no matter how we turned it, i think it might have been because i started the call with screen rotate lock on, i turned it off during the call but that didn't help.
It also chews battery, but all video calls do, i think i went from 70% to 37% in 1 hour, on an iphone se first gen. So no group video calls? It doesn't support the 3.5mm headphones for me. Anyone else got the same issue? I still like to keep Telegram on my phone even though it is mostly irrelevant as everybody uses WhatsApp unfortunately.  :(

You mentioned video and audio are encrypted by default. Why don't you do the same for text? Anyone found a way to select a particular webcam on the Desktop client version? Tried on 2 Windows 10 machines. No video for me, my friends do have video and I can see them. E2EE by default [deleted] La berenjena Updated desktop version, it's available there as well!! It's available on all platforms. >>Video calls will receive more features and improvements in future versions, as we work toward launching group video calls in the coming months. This is an alpha release, I'm sure it'll be possible soon enough. No... *yet*. Because it's cloud backup. WhatsApp sucks.

Problem is that messaging app is winner takes all. All the normies are on whatsapp. I know you asked this 3 months ago, but this is a mobile-only feature atm E2EE by default would break what makes Telegram great Signal has videocalls. Cloud chats are amazing. I can instantly search all my chats for any word or phrase and all the photos are backed up too. I guess secret chats may work for you? wonder if the group video calls will allow group voice calls, or some variant of that.

would be cool to have a voice chat on top of the existing group chats, with members joining and leaving as they wish on the voice conversation in the group. Oh cool, thanks So group calls will arrive in the oncoming months, right??? Is it also likely that they will implement live streaming??? Ehat's the difference? Whatsapp has both cloud stuff and encryption Yeah agreed. WhatsApp/Facebook sucks. but even if you want to quit it, you can't. unless you are willing to cut off contact with most people. Yes... and? I can't ask for a feature just because other service offers it? Or how does that work? Cloud chat is the main reason why I use TG as main messenger. While it's very user friendly, you do realise that is not e2ee and can be read by telegram, right? The person doesn't like cloud synced because of privacy concerns. Not because they like a relatively poor user experience. Like in Discord? This is one on one videocalls, a group call would be multiple people/devices on the same call WhatsApp has not cloud. All you cab do is backup your chat on Google's servers. Whatsapp backup is not encrypted. Yeah but I also use gmail and we know google reads our mail, so that's where my standard is set. At least Telegram isn't mining my conversations for advertising. Are you certain that the chats can be read by Telegram? I don't believe that's true.

From their [FAQ](https://telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-process-data-requests):

> To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure. Cloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data. Thanks, but I was asking what's the difference between alpha version and... latest version? Or however they call them. Ok? But why should he care about what you use or what your standards are when it comes to security? It wasn't about you mate.
Also, if you're using Gmail for private conversations, your standards are pretty bad. The answer is in the para quoted by you. Which is yes, of course they can.
They own the keys, which means they have the access to the chats.
Moreover, their server isn't open source, so how can you be sure any of this is even true.
Don't get me wrong, I like telegram and use it very actively, but not as a secure messenger.
WhatsApp literally uses Signal encryption protocol but hardly anyone believes them. Neither their client, nor their server is open sourced.

Also, yes cloud chats are amazing, but they can be E2EE at the same time, eg - Wire. Hell, matrix is decentralised and federated, and still manages to be E2EE without giving up cloud sync. Oh, my bad.  

Calling the videocalls an ""alpha version"" means that it works but it's in an extremely preliminary phase, overtime they will keep improving them and the name might change (usually from alpha to beta and then final), but it doesn't really means there are more versions available. I also don't like that their servers aren't open source, and I personally would use something like Matrix if I could get everyone on it. Oh thanks, I thought they went from beta to alpha to final! TIL! Thanks again. Same here. It'd be a perfect world if everyone did."

Ahhh...again the rotten apple Doesn’t it normally take a few days for an app to be approved?

What's new

""Yes. Video Calls (alpha version)""

Edit: [It's on their blog.](https://telegram.org/blog/video-calls) It seem it will be released later for Android users.

Edit: Just released an update with Videcalls (alpha version). Yeah i dont see de update either Telegram product updates will always be released simultaneously for both Android and iOS. Considering the current covid situation, he sould've expected that already I tried video calling from iOS to Android with version 6.3 and the call never connects. It gets stuck exchanging encryption keys. Voice calls don't work either. Seems to me like they changed the protocol. Video Calls (Alpha Version) is currently rolling out to Android users. I just got it today after an update. Webcam cannot have IP address in the first place, your phone/laptop/pc do have it though. Yeah man, put tape over all your webcams. They can also steal cash right off your desk while you aren't looking. No. It's not a webcam and that's not true anyway. no What???! please leave reddit.  i am crying after reading this There you go: [https://twitter.com/durov/status/1294277341762461696](https://twitter.com/durov/status/1294277341762461696) Sure it is!

I got the update for the standard Android Telegram client. Not sure if it's available for Telegram X. oh really? [http://telegram.org/blog/video-calls/](http://telegram.org/blog/video-calls/) While yes, this pandemic might have affected this, I don't believe it did.

Durov said himself, that they have submitted the update for review several days before they uploaded it to Google Play Store already. It's just Apple not caring enough to just push an update when the developers want it to be pushed. I wonder if two iOS users, both on 6.3, can call each other What version is it and did you have to enable it in settings? What did he say?

Lemme guess, *it's fake*? They said month but for a more poetic result I would go with birthday. Or I don't know how you say august in russian. 100% deserved it. 😂 Like most apps, they try to be... Apple seems to cockblock a handful of times. Today is actually an exception. They pretty much never did this before. I understand, but if I was him I would have planned it with more time. Unless you're a really top app, you dpn't have power on when you app is going to be published by, say, Google Apple Microsoft or whatever company. I'm a dev myself. Yeah well it’s not like telegram is one of the most popular apps in the world! I'm on Telegram for Android v7.0.0 (2060), and I didn't need to enable it under settings. I just have to call someone and then hit the video button. It ends with t,

Preventing BOTS;15;i9kt2f;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/i9kt2f/preventing_bots/;14;"Hey guys
We have a Public group with invite links spread over internet but there is a problem.
Several bots join group via invite link and start adding other bots for posting spams/adds.
And every time admin deletes these bots they join again via invite links.

How can we solve this?";2020-08-14 15:12:09;"Don't make your group public. Or, if you absolutely must, host the link on one site that can be changed regularly, point everyone to that site only, and cycle it every time someone joins. You can add inline button into your welcome message to check the user. Only real people and some advanced bots know how to click inline buttons. Then ban new user in case of button was not clicked. There's some antibot bots, I have personally seen this:

AntiUserbotsBot

This bot applies a double CAPTCHA to new members of the group. I hope it works for you Pal. 

You can look for it in the telegram search Create a bot tha bans other bots when joins your group. there is a new\_chat\_members list that notifies your bot when someone joins the group. And on every member there is a attribute called is\_bot or something like that, dont remember right now. Use that to account if the bot joining should be there or not. and your own bot as a admin could ban the intruders.

&#x200B;

Search for Telegram API Bot use this: @join_captcha_bot Thanks. The group is a college group hence we cant make it private. Also the invite links are spread in other telegram/WhatsApp groups, not on the web. Thanks but how exaxtly should i do that? Official bot api telegram bots can't join groups. (ie, bots whos username ends with `bot`) 
So banning users that join with is_bot is only relevant if you're looking to stop people from ADDING bots to your group.

OP is likely asking for info on stopping userbots, which will not have `is_bot=true`, since they're considered regular users. So this answer won't help. As I said in my other comment - you'll need to start using a bot which supports welcome messages, and some sort of CAPTCHA.
There are lots out there. My personal favourite is Rose. I myself use group guardian

@GroupGuardianBot

It does exactly what the other user here mentioned, captcha welcome message for verification its not a bot, problem could be it has a grace period, though, if i recall right, a user can't post till they verify the captcha, been a while though, could be wrong on this."

I have never seen that happen with friends who use Androids but had some friends with iPhones seen online while the app was in background. This has been my experience with me and my wife That's because you immediately close the app from the task switcher 

Press the home button first (so that Telegram knows you've exited the app), then open task switcher and close Telegram > doesn't show you as offline

online u mean? my sympathies, Fren. Yeah"

Telegram *Volunteer Support* has [responded to me](https://imgur.com/a/iw5pTDd): Hi, I believe these missing posts were caused by a server glitch. Hopefully they should now have been restored.

**Update 1**

[chemicalpepper](https://www.reddit.com/user/chemicalpepper/) replied with [Telegram's Tweet](https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1293965974039928833):  Sorry about that. It's a temporary glitch and the posts should become available again soon.

Hi fellow Redditors,

I'm one of an admins of a public group. We don't speak English and it is a very small group. We do not share illegal content in fact we strictly watch the group for content quality. We have five minutes slow mode for instance...

Today something strange happened. I had download [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCeQLeQiRP4) as usual, then I posted it in the group. Approximately five minutes later my post got deleted. When I checked ""recent actions"" section I saw that my post was deleted by Telegram:

[The message shows who deleted my post.](https://preview.redd.it/yrfsj5p6usg51.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=49acbe995e4294da499cf03e2c7890a5eaef9529)

I've checked the account and I saw that it is the genuine *Telegram* account:

[Telegram Account](https://preview.redd.it/rzmb0by7usg51.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=b83020130231f83d021c64f8c8e1f0901667633d)

We have several bots for scanning undesirable content. Sometimes they judge wrongly but this time they didn't take an action. Neither admins nor members add people to the groups. Maybe close friends could have added each other. But nothing significant happened recently. We have basically same members for the last two months. I've also checked for *Spam Info Bot* which says I do not have a restriction.

Since it's a post that doesn't violate Telegram rules, how could it happened? Does Telegram watch groups and channels actively? Did we get Telegram attention? Do people report for some reason and Telegram deletes that automatically? How did it happened so fast?

We opened the group in March and I've seen this for the first time... Do you have any idea why it happened?

Have a great day...";2020-08-13 20:05:16;"Telegram just tweeted about the issue: https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1293965974039928833 Hi there, I've seen some cases around today, please, contact Telegram support to ask help. They will help you to check if possible, what happened. That happened to me as well this morning. I was sharing Epic free games links with my pals. Thank you very much... Yes, I'll definitely ask them later. But first, I had to ask Reddit...

You can ban users in recent actions section. So, when I see this action took place, I try to ban Telegram account. [It is funny, because I could ban Telegram.](https://imgur.com/a/XOl0Mey)

At this point, I had to ask. BTW, those were scheduled messages, I though there was another administrator. I've faced the same in one of my channel, reached Telegram support by the chat, and they told me

*Messages in some channels that were posted in the last few hours may have become unavailable and appear as “deleted by Telegram”. This is a temporary glitch, it will be fixed by the anti-spam team. Sorry.* >Yes, I'll definitely ask them later. But first, I had to ask Reddit...

No you didn't. Telegram support is there exactly for this kind of issues.

(Sorry, I totally don't want to sound harsh, I'm totally ok with this post, but if you want definitive answers to such questions, the volunteer support is the best place to ask.) What was the video you posted about? Thank you very much. It's probably the same glitch caused the situation. I've embedded it to post. Here you again:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCeQLeQiRP4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCeQLeQiRP4) 

It isn't a significant video honestly. About an audition for a role, I guess. It's cringewothy and send it for fun."

Videos and voice notes on 2x Speed by default.;15;i8ru4p;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/i8ru4p/videos_and_voice_notes_on_2x_speed_by_default/;5;"Hello all! 

I've been searching mainly on Google if this issue has happened to someone too.

When I send a video or a voice note, their playback speed is always at 2x (even if the playback button ""2x"" on voice notes is turned off). Since this happens with videos too, I Imagine there's a feature to send them in a 2x speed. However, I haven't found an option on Setting to deactivate this.

Is this normal? Can this be toggled off? 

Thanks in advance for your replies.";2020-08-13 05:41:35;"Yes, it’s really strange. And not, it’s not a feature to send voice/video messages faster. It’s just like a local feature so that you can play it faster. 
The only thing that I think you can do is to reinstall the app, it should be solved only by tapping the 2X icon. 
Ps: don’t be afraid about reinstalling, all your messages will be there when you install again with not extra steps required there's no feature to send them at a 2X speed in official clients. only playback is allowed to be listened to in 2X speed, next to the name of the sender and the x button. sounds like an issue w your third party client Thanks, I'll try that since it's kind of annoying. I'm not afraid of losing messages and such, that's one of the several reasons why I prefer Telegram over WhatsApp Well, I tried to send same files/videos with Telegram in-app file selection. Same problem. Or what do you mean with third party client? I want to try everything that could fix this just curious, what device are you recording/sending from? and what device are you using to view?"

I hope more people would use Telegram now with the advent of video calls. Tried these on iOS beta and they were pretty damn good! I was most surprised by the fact that I could choose the codec for video processing, including H265, which is relatively new still. [deleted] Can't wait to use this in 10 months on the F-Droid version!! [deleted] Is it the same with X? Does it get Videocall futures too? Now i want Screen casting too like (google meets, Discord PC)  
Like Screen, Video + Audio Total package on android  
Do you guys know any other android that can do this? [deleted] why would more ppl use it? other apps can do it as well. this is a must have now for messaging apps It's not so much how new it is, but the processing power required to do it, it's still not fully adopted across the industry. Fortunately Apple knows how to make good silicon that can natively handle h.265 with dedicated chips There is beta on PC (look in the settings of Our telegram desktop version), but I'm not sure if it has video calls No video calls yet on desktop, at least Windows. Mac OS beta has them It shouldn't take that long now? They've been really good about publishing source since they added verified builds. Same with X Of course, they’ll be ready soon for Linux and Windows. There’s a beta already on Mac Not that I'd be against a longer bio... 

But why would you want your whole resume there? More people will use Telegram once this feature is fully released because as you said, it's a must have for messaging apps. https://www.rankred.com/features-of-telegram-messenger-app/

PS: v6.3 features NOT included Actually; i shouldn't have called it resume. Resume just implies much longer stuff than what i'm suggesting.I want to put together a structure like this:\*\*y.o./ j o b /former \*\*\*/ assistant manager of \*\*\*\*\*\* projects at \*\*\*/ID of chief manager @\*\*\*somethin like that...just to give u an idea.

I like how people are boooing me as if i want to copy/paste victor Hugo's Le miserables  in there :/  When in fact, all i'm asking for, is 40-50 more askii characters. Every char is like 1 single byte. \[Telegram allows gigabytes of upload! Bytes are nothing compared to that\]

70 chars is just too short. It'd make description more convenient. Right now, It's more like a puzzle game of ""How do i abbreviate this"". Needs for external links would go down.

And i'm not encouraging the use of other msg apps. I totally distrust them!! but the ones that have been in the game, aren't exactly stupid that have decided to allow 100-150 chars. As more as I passionately love Telegram, this will barely bring any users at all to Telegram... Well, I mean... Unless you have a super long job title it sure is enough for ""Doing X at company Y"" 

Also I'm pretty sure they're not using ascii encoding for that since you can put non-ascii letters in there, but I get your point. I don't think it's a storage thing.   
They probably just don't want this to end up being a place where teens post their endless song lyrics. Keep it short, keep it classy.

I don't understand why you're getting downvoted, tho. It's a valid request. Also, don't worry about song lyrics.Teens are sending all that musixmatch screen recordings in profile videos.Teens would't ask for 40 more characters. That much, wouldnt make a dif for teen fantasies . But it would in buisiness. If only like 10 people requested this on their Twitter, maybe they would consider it.I'm sure there have been other users that have wished for this at some point.

  
Things would be so much easier. Especially if you have an account that gets referred to a lot.

If u have wished for this too, u can go to their twitter and request it at the release of the new version.  
AND BRo i'm telling you. Maybe it's not of any importance for u as of now, but wait till you get a job in a place where ranks, etc are actually a thing. Like what happened to me.  
I remember there was a time i didn't care either. I make a point out of not using Telegram for anything work related other than casual chats with colleagues. There are other tools for that that are better suited for that by a long shot, like Teams or Slack.  
My friends and family don't really care what my rank is, neither does anyone else have to know."

In fact everyone is using WhatsApp because everyone else is using it I don't hate Whatsapp just for itself, I hate it because even if is coded like shit, works like shit lots of non-telegram user complains about it but still is the most used one, it's f disgusting I recommend telegram to my every friend and was successful to move (at least make an account) 7-8 friends to telegram. I haven't used WhatsApp since one n half years. I only use Telegram and few friends now using telegram for me. I shifted them to here. I proud on myself. video calls being tested in beta now .. then theres no stopping telegram! Telegram>>>>What's app. But most of my contacts still uses what's app so i had to use it. But I'm thinking it's just a matter of time they too realise how much better telegram is. I never even used that app before. Why are the people wearing their jeans pant under their knees? Hi, Telegram users. I come here to announce our messenger and privacy focused savior. Matrix.org I never used whatsapp but for the simple reason that the U.S. banned it, I downloaded it. I didn't make an account but the U.S. shouldn't be banning perfectly legitimate apps and putting up an iron curtain. I use both whatsapp and telegram. Telegram is more feature rich. But there are 3 things that make me look towards whatsapp
1. That green colour is more better than dark blue in telegram.
2.every one uses whatsapp in my area.
3. I use whatsapp status feature very much and doesnt find that feature in telegtam. Never mind telegram or WhatsApp... Get signal! Let's change that.
telegram.org/dl to everyone. xD Yes you are right but its difficult to change Thats because WhatsApp was first of its kind and then Facebook bought it I don't think they upgraded it much later It’s indeed coded with the feet. I’m pretty much convinced that Facebook has been doing this on purpose in order to push all the WhatsApp users to use Facebook Messenger instead. Am curious to know why you think it’s coded like ****.
Are you referring to its feature compared to Telegram. Did the same and later on I just stop replied on WhatsApp unless emergency or really good reason to reply. I was able to completely remove the app within a month or so. Doesn’t some of your complain about not getting notifications sometimes? I'm proud of you too. Stories... A lot of whatsapp users don't switch to telegram for that sh!t Isn't that more like Discord? U.S banned what? Bruh, there are themes! You can customize the colors of every single element. There are many WhatsApp-style themes. Just find and enable one and there you go!

For the last thing, yeah, there’s only profile bio for a text, no statuses Signal is an app that looks like was coded in 2008. Signal sucks! I tried to use it but just sucks, it is even worse than WhatsApp Then leak your phone number and get iced by the islamic erdoganoputinisten. Use telegram handles and be happy. Let's never forget Signal users are the vegans of the messaging world. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

But Messenger is coded even worse xD That's a good point... I'm not referring to feature and such, but mainly to the user experience, and the fact that sometimes it freezes its self for no reasons, android and ios (main source: non-telegram friends), and lastly the video and image codec used to record and send media, that are just low quality for being 2010+ (but I cannot tell on the ios side) No, it's working fine.
But u can tell them to ignore battery optimization for telegram from the phone's settings. Seriously people use that gimmick? Anyways that can be easily replicated just like fb lifted it from snap. Video def was a obvious missing one so let’s see. Discord has security issues. Keybase is more like discord, but all is encrypted. Sorry, that is my bad. I got whatsapp confused with wechat. I have a few people on WhatsApp though and pretty much all their statuses are either default or empty. I wonder how much it’s used globally Yeah, the iOS version looks fine, but Android one makes me close to vomit. And it’s bad feature-wise, looks just buggy and unpolished. You send messages, but you feel like you don’t know if they’ll even arrive at all xd

I don’t even mention where they were storing messages in plaintext on their desktop app, their desktop app was even worse. I tried setting it up, but it didn’t sync with the phone... Personally I have never had a problem with signal. It has all the features i could possibly want from a messaging app. Signal is moving away from phone numbers any way. So it won’t be long before we have signal handles😁 Good bot Nah, I'm no WhatsApp fan but that would be hard to prove. They did ask competent people for help with encryption and they agreed to help. Now, as WhatsApp is closed-source, there's no way to verify that this encryption is there but it's also impossible for either of us to prove that it's NOT there. Right now, only Facebook knows for sure. Haha, Haven’t tried in a long while but from what I see from friends it looks better (feature wise) than WhatsApp. I prefer, use and recommend Telegram to all my contacts.
But even tho WhatsApp send low quality media, it handles everything it does well. This is my experience in Both Android and iOS. I think people use it sometimes if it already is there. To upload some memes and shit. But would that be a killer feature? I don’t think so. But I might be wrong...

But I can’t see them appearing any time soon, most Telegram’s existing users would hate it, and lack of this thing is one of the things that are appealing to them.

The only thing that could appear for me are reactions, not crucial, but I’ve heard people around saying they’re missing that Heads up, Zoom acquired Keybase. I deleted my account immediately. I meant in terms of the service it provides the end user and the form that takes. I don't care about Discord itself. Holy shit, you unironically using this thing? Make sure to download VK Messenger too, so Russian government doesn’t miss out either! They may not have carried it out, but the founder himself said it was the reason he left: https://www.neowin.net/news/whatsapp-ceo-leaves-after-facebook-reportedly-decides-to-weaken-encryption/ I don't know if discord can do bridges to other messenging apps, but yeah, it has a thing for group chat rooms like IRC Nah, just downloaded it and denied permissions for eveything on it.

If it gets banned I will most definitely download it ;) This website's story links ""weaken encryption"" to an article that literally talks about them introducing E2E. That's topsy turvy. Permission boxes don’t control everything an app has access too"

>Q: What do the green checks mean?
> 
>One check — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications.
Two checks — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message).
> 
>We don't have a 'delivered to device' status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want. So which particular one would that check mean? In a private chat, a message changes to two ticks when the recipient of the message opens the chat in the app. It doesn't change to two ticks if you only read the notification [deleted] I mean I could definitely just have read the FAQs, but thank you so much! And how would it help you to know it got delivered to his PC where he's logged in as well, but not to his phone yet? Just wait, the person will receive the message anyways and if not, he wouldn't receive it because of that tick either. [deleted] Well. It’s not WhatsApp but Telegram. And works in that way for logic reasons (read messages above) What's the matter; if he has received the message he would answer you, and if it's something so urgent you should just call him. You will not know, because it could be he's not using that device right now.

Also, he still gets the message, you just don't know, but what would you gain from knowing that? Do you need to check all the time if people received your messages? They'll get them, just.. don't care about it that much. You couldn't influence this anyway, he wouldn't get the message faster"

If you are really worried, you could also use telegram desktop to download a complete copy of the chats, to be totally safe.
But telegram does keep the chats. Sorry about your loss.  

When an account is deleted, it wipes their data but leaves the messages up for the other side. So even if her account is gone, the convos will remain. I do recommend exporting data via Desktop anyway, just so you can have an offline version. Especially since her number might be reissued to a different user later on by her cell service provider. If that person tries to sign up for Telegram, they'd have to reset the account, so it's best to have a backup. Thank you so much for your reply Thank you i will do that later"

There is a setting called ""Sensitive Content → Disable Filtering"" under ""Privacy and Security"" on the desktop Telegram, and it's in the web version as well (which you could possibly operate via Safari if you don't have a computer). Disable that anywhere and it will disable it globally for your account.

Send me your favorite NSFW channel via PM and I'll send you a screenshot of it being shown on an iPhone. ;)

Also, it's not NSFW content being blocked, it's NSFW /r/TelegramGroups and /r/TelegramChannels being blocked. You can send all the NSFW stuff to your Saved Messages you want. No, it's against apple policies.

However, you can use web.telegram.org to access NSFW channels If your country agree with NSFW content, tap 10 times on settings icon and switch remove sensitive data to off Sometimes you can enable NSFW for your account via TDesktop. Worked for me Use Nicegram. Change to Android underrated comment here, and also 100% correct. Just one note here: is some countries this option is disabled server-side I don't see this setting on Android Telegram or Plus app. Is this iOS exclusive? No other solution for that? that only removes sensitive info in the logs you can send from the debug menu, it has no bearing on NSFW content Didn’t work. You can also do that with Web version: https://t.me/tgbeta/3919 You can use Nicegram from the App Store No, apple users are restricted by app store guidelines Don't use iOS There are two ways:
Your country block NSFW content ( there is no way to fix that )
Or
You didn’t wait a bit ( try to wait more than one day ) What’s that Why can I use Reddit for this stuff then? Man that’s really unfortunate They also pay for this privilege /s An fork of the official client that has more features 

https://nicegram.app Fuck apple Thank you. Is it safe to use? Its basically a frontend for TG Reading from the website:

Questions;4;i6hs0l;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/i6hs0l/questions/;4;[removed];2020-08-09 14:23:39;"1. Cloud drafts for secret chats don't make sense, as your other devices don't even know about the secret chat. Drafts are only saved locally on that device. For all other (non-secret) chats cloud drafts work as they should. Using the option to delete all cloud drafts will remove them. This should also remove a draft you made for a secret chat, if the secret chat is on the device you cleared drafts from.

2. If you send a photo as a photo (not as a file), Telegram will compress it to save space on the servers. I can imagine that this is also done in secret chats, but not to save space as the data sent isn't even saved on Telegram servers. If you send something as a file Telegram will do no compression and should preserve all metadata.

3. No, why would they? If your profile pictures were end-to-end encrypted, nobody else would be able to see them. Whoever ""sees"" your account (receives a message mentioning you, a forwarded message with disabled forward privacy, your username) will be able to see your profile picture according to your privacy settings. You can choose who can or cannot see the profile picture in mentioned privacy settings.

4. Again, privacy settings. You can choose between ""Everyone"", ""My Contacts"", and ""Nobody"". You can also set who can find you via phone number. While ""Everyone"" allows everyone who has your number to identify you on Telegram, ""My Contacts"" only allow people who you have saved already to identify via phone number. If you send a message to someone's phone number they get your number in return. If you don't want them to get your number then delete them from your contacts and just use their username. [removed] [removed] Signal != Telegram.

Telegram connects via the MTProto Protocol to specific IPs of the Datacenteres. You cannot intercept them in any way, as there is no URL that could be forged on DNS-level. Messages are encrypted with Telegram's public key, or, for secret chats, the recipient's public key. It doesn't matter if anyone else gets the messages."

Private groups created as a location-based group are not private;44;i611f7;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/i611f7/private_groups_created_as_a_locationbased_group/;13;"I don't know if it's a privacy issue or a feature but I learned this the hard way.
I'm admin of a Telegram group that was initially public and location-based but due to the increase of the number of spammers joining the group we decided to make it private and just share an *Invite link* but surprisingly there were still spammers joining the group, then finally we found out that **location-base groups will stay open to everyone on the location area and you can't change the location**.

The Android app (version 6.3.0) doesn't mention anything about this, the interface shows:

> Private groups can only be joined if you were invited or have an invite link

Only on the Desktop app (version 2.2) says this:

> People can join if they are added, have an invite link, or from ""Groups nearby"".

So we tried to see if it's possible to change the location but it's not possible using the apps (Desktop/Android) nor the API.

Then the last option was create a bot to kick out people joining the private group via *Groups nearby* and the only option is using the TDLib, because the Telegram Bot API doesn't provide a way to know if people join via an *Invite link* or via *Groups nearby*.

We published the rationale of all this issue and the code for this bot (45 lines of Python) on this repo https://github.com/sre-paris/bot#rationale

If you know more about this behavior or you have other workaround to share, please don't hesitate.";2020-08-08 18:33:03;"I guess they're private in that you can't find them in global search yes, because they can be found publicly via going to a location and using that feature. private groups can only be joined if you join via a link. Of course they are not private. That's common sense. Have you stats that n number of people joined through group nearby feature ? If yes then how it's traceable (or which API) ? That's the problem, it's as a private group and people can join it without the link. When I read this on the Telegram app for a private locate-based group:

> Private groups can only be joined if you were invited or have an invite link

my common sense says me that it will be private 🤷‍♂️ Regarding the number of people joining via *Groups nearby*, they were ~5 people per week during the last 6 weeks, it's related to the fact that the location is a big city (Paris, France).
To find that number you can export your data and look for join messages for an specific group (see https://telegram.org/blog/export-and-more for more details) and to see who is joining using *Invite link* or *Groups nearby* you need to use the API with the TDLib, here's an example https://github.com/sre-paris/bot#2-use-a-bot-to-kick-spammers-out it’s a public group without the username as a link lol. if you don’t want it to be public, don’t make a location based group. So if they are private how other people in that location will find them? 🤔 Thanks for attachments, let me dive into it. Exactly, I see the same issue. I think it's probably a UI/UX conflict, because it seems there are 2 kind of private groups:

* Private: only join via invite link or invited by a member
* Private and location-based: only join via invite link,. invited by a member or via Groups nearby

The Android app only mention the first one, that's why I thought that making it private will deactivate the location-based feature.

It's maybe just a wording issue on the app version. They are meant to be joint if you are in the location, they are not private"

[Request] Please update the apple watch app with some polish;40;i5vu1p;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/i5vu1p/request_please_update_the_apple_watch_app_with/;6;"As of today the apple watch/watchos telegram companion app is disappointing and I'm sad about this since it's the only messaging app I use that is available for watchos other than facebook messenger. These are my requests: 

1) Let people choose which contact to start chatting to and not only by selecting the latest chat in your history

2) Since you can only view the latests chats in your apple watch, these are often buried by groups that always go on top, so please let we decide which chats we want to visualize on our apple watch, or at least make the 1) happen

3) Make the messages history on every chat longer

4) Increase the number of latest chats on the homescreen 

5) If it's not possible to implement animated stickers on apple watch, please at least don't show a giant black dot when someone sends you an animated sticker, or when you select stickers from your sticker history. It's horrible and confusing

6) (this is maybe too much, but I'll try..)
Make the watch app independent from        iphone

Sorry for my english";2020-08-08 11:35:45;if they bothered to polish for apple watch then they have to polish the Android wear too This sucks. I was thinking of getting an apple watch now with cellular since you can now use it independent of an iPhone. If the telegram app is as bad as I hear it is and requires an iphone then it's worse than the wear os version. The wear os version works really well and while I don't have a cellular wear watch the telegram app works independently using WiFi on wear os. I don't know how bad is the android wear one, but from videos on yt it looks way better yeah, the watchos app for telegram is really bad Same. Bought today SE model and was shocked with the telegram app and lack of cellular support. Especially, when there are a lot of independent apps, which don't require iphone connection.

There's nothing much that can be done. Thanks for replying but it won’t show “clear cache” in iPhone Will that still keep all files and messages?

 [https://scamalytics.com/ip/isp/cloudip-llc](https://scamalytics.com/ip/isp/cloudip-llc)  

Seems it's used by VPN providers, maybe Telegram can check these things before allowing somebody else login in the account and change the 2fa password Are you using your own number or a VoIP number? Because it's impossible for someone to get hold of your number without having authentication code There an option to terminate that log in just do it and turn on multi-authentication Well, several security experts have confirmed that security and iOS are not precisely friends. And I have been never agree that a phone number should be a requirement in an account creation, it just be user name and password to have less security leaks. 

Yes, I'm talking about how an account is created in telegram. If phone number can be removed later, that would be great. Second, could you please tell me how does screen look like when you click on 2-step verification option in the same ""Privacy and Security"" screen? The session is no longer active [deleted] That's possible by third party apps having access to sms permissions. My own number in Hong Kong, maybe somebody acceded to the verification number from other device? Seems he already set up a password before me There just appears a field when you have to write the password and then click the ✅ button, do it again for confirmation and then you're done. Which one? Your own or attacker's? And it's not so easy, right now in Hong Kong, unless that person who did this has special authority or is from law enforcement agency. That isn't actually possible. Are you logged in on Desktop?

If you're logged in, then you can export all.your data form there. Then delete and recreate your account. I was asking /u/MrWidmoreHK to check if 2-step verification is actually set up for his account Attacker Yes, logged. I'm downloading the content now. Thanks

Maybe the telco operation intercepted the message ? You can do that? Wasn't setup, the attacker seems to put a password on my account Okay. So if you go to ""Privacy and Security"" settings, what does it say about ""2-step verification""? And if you tap it, how does the screen look like? Screenshot would be very informative > Maybe the telco operation intercepted the message ?

That was a case in Russia several times; chances are you have to be a political target for this (or be of interest to secret services otherwise). If you’re logged in, you’d better log off all other sessions. No idea. Good luck! Yes. Your Telegram Data can be exported through Desktop [Wtf] but the second check up is the password, I put on one because the same happened to me and I just had to delete my account and do it again 😅 when you have it and click on two step verification in settings it says ""insert the password"" It asks for the 2fa password, I don't remember putting any. And doesn't allow me to send an email as doesn't been set Good to know, thanks! Well, shit. It looks very strange, so I suggest pinging Telegram in Twitter ( @ Telegram or @ SMSTelegram, both accounts are official), in-app support and if you don't get the answer withing 4-5 days, contact them via e-mail.

If you're the legitimate owner of phone number you use and someone else got access to your account, then they could help you get rid of that ""backdoor"".

Also your account should be considered insecure now, if you have Telegram Desktop installed, make a copy of your account (Export account in Settings) and be ready to create another account if this one gets deleted. Thanks, I'm doing the backup now and later resetting the account. It's strange that they managed to get the session. 
Maybe the HK telco operator intercepted the message ?
I'm not worried about the content, seems the hacked only setup a 2fa password and then delete the latest Telegram notifications, maybe an automated process. Telegram has 2-step verification since 2015 exactly because first factor (SMS) is unreliable in some countries. When you solve your problem and reset your account, don't forget to setup a 2-step verification (read more [here](https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-does-2-step-verification-work)) so that intercepting SMS won't be enough.

Stay secure."

[pixB in action!](https://reddit.com/link/i4qpvb/video/azh3mnctidf51/player)

So i wanted to learn node. What better way than to implement something. This is a reverse image search + text analysis telegram bot which uses Google Vision API's in backend.

Easy to use : Take a SS, forward to telegram bot, amuse yourself.

Mainly made out of the need for finding context/origin of memes while scrolling on social media :p

(Also cuz there's no inbuilt google reverse image search implementation in phones. You have to upload to reverse.photos. google lens also does not provide significant results)

Content :

1. Reverse image search returns a guess label along with entities present (with accuracy %). Also returns links for pages containing matching image
2. Text analysis is done on both - text present on images and text sent by msg. Also returns entities and a sentiment analysis score per every block of text. Also contains google calender event link for any dates present and google map search link for any addresses
3. List of dominant colors are also returned along with an image containing those colors.

This is my first time making/posting a project like this. So feel free to criticise the shit out of this! . (Suggestions / feedbacks on features/code/best practises are welcome)[Github Link](https://github.com/varunwahi/pixb)";2020-08-06 15:13:35;[deleted] You'll have to host this yourself.

Shots fired 😂😂;107;i4c3ed;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/ctderhshk8f51.png;15;;2020-08-05 22:33:12;"For those who missed the joke at first (such as myself), 16MB is the maximum size for shared files in WhatsApp, Telegram's primary competitor. 183 times larger than Discord free Oh wow, shots fired at Discord!  And it's pathetic that even with Nitro you still can't send as large of files as you can with Telegram...  That alone is a deal-breaker! Discord too, and they also want money if you want to share files up to 100MB Wait, WhatsApp file limit is 100 mb 🤔 if telegram could come up with discord feature, that would be rad! I just slice them up into multiple rar files and send them over that way. WhatsApp is probably ecstatic that there's at least one app out there with more awful file size limits lol For videos it’s 16MB [The maximum allowed file size is 100 MB. Videos that are recorded using WhatsApp are limited to 16MB.](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/chats/how-to-send-media/?lang=en) I'm sending right now a 67 mb video
https://i.imgur.com/XVRohci.jpg Good job WhatsApp. 
Anyways 2000/100=20 times less In fact, I'm the first to believe that Telegram is a million times better than WhatsApp. It is, even their backup/restore system is shit, I moved to iOS a week ago, and I couldn't restore all my conversations from Android beacuse of their shitty system, at least Telegram has everything on the cloud and you don't even have to restore anything. Influence your people then to use Telegram instead, the best messaging service ever ;)"

What nitpicky features would you want on Telegram?;90;i3zg2r;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/i3zg2r/what_nitpicky_features_would_you_want_on_telegram/;139;"By nitpicky I mean stuff that aren't popular, very niche, probably good but you could also want.

&#x200B;

1) Seperate the tab of Media into Image and Video.

2) Have an toggle in the settings where when someone adds you to a group, you are not immediately joined in. Instead you get a request of accepting or declining. It would work like Facebook. If the person has not accepted or declined the request, it means that the person is in a status of Add Request Sent.

3) For Private Channels, have an option for the administrator to approve first incoming subscribers.

4) Have an option for messages that works as a multi pin. The messages wouldn't be pinned above but be accessible in a tab.

5) Have an option to put the chat folder tabs in the sidebar instead of at top. Because I barely use the sidebar. Also personally it would make the interface look clean.

6) Have an option to put the chat folder tabs in the bottom just like Messenger.";2020-08-05 08:21:26;"sticker and GIF folders Change default chat folder. e.g when i open telegram i want to see “unread folder” or “personal chats” first. Instead of “all”. Ability to create multiple Folders in saved messages. It's already used as a personal storage app by most people. So we can move the files and organize them as required. Message Request feature like Instagram, as some people from a group just directly come to our inbox to promote their channel or abuse Bigger albums. 10 files per album is way too small and is fairly annoying to deal with when sending a lot of files. seperate tab for hashtags in chat details. I want to quickly see all hashtags used, and be able to click on them to see all messages with that hashtag A like button or message reactions. Just a way to quickly react to a message. Have the option to remove the ""all messages"" folder probably Notification when people have voted in a poll. Sometimes I throw out something like 'what date are you free?' and have no idea when everyone has voted. 1.Better **Encryption** (with sync capability) 
   
2.More features in media editing like **filters**.    

3.Redefined **Global search**  

4.Better inbuilt **Video player** with option to play local videos as well.    

5.**Folders** within Saved Messages.Not to confuse with Chat folders.  

6.**Friend request** like feature so that unknown user interaction can be avoided.


And please support **Telegram X** too.Despite it being an *official* client , even the beta version is not updated regularly. Allow images in chats to be collapsed/hidden.

Sometimes you want to keep the chat up, but that animated gif it really distracting out the corner of your eye. Or, you're at work and it's kinda NSFW. Whatever. How Slack does it would be great. Folder in Saved Message I would say... 

1. A toggle for the new trending stickers for switching between animated stickers and steady ones. 
2. A quick way to access saved messages from private conversations, like in a new tab where you could see your contacts, if you tap in one it'll show the messages you saved. 

*You can access to that by writing the name of the contact in the search bar and it'll show you the messages you saved from that contact. But this way is just not as good as something more obvious and integrated. *

3. Better ""favorite stickers"" section. Right now it only allows you to use the last 5 you marked as favorites (because yes, they'll be grouping). An option to go back to swiping to get to the next media instead of touch 1) Group calls finally
2) Make phone number visible to noone
3) Completely hide last seen time even if it's approximate (recently, within a week and etc...) BotAPI enhanced with more complex controls: sliders, calendars, list, tables,.. 🙏😁 For group/supergroup users, the ability to label people with a tag (a la Discord). Or a way to tap the user's name and be presented with a small screen with such tags as well as a snippet of the user's profile (with the ability to tap again somewhere to go to the full profile). Vim bindings No more “contact has joined telegram” notifications A toggle to send full res media? Make option to switch Slow Internet connection to reduce Traffic size The old Windows Live Messenger had this Plus extension thing that added tons of new features to the messenger, including an audio search function which allowed users to browse the web for funny snippets of, mostly, memes, and send it to a contact. Something like that would be pretty neat, albeit unlikely to ever happen. 
1. Individual read/delivery receipts in group chats (like in Facebook messenger) so you can see exactly who read the message, not just that someone did
2. Handle “xxx is on telegram “ better. Don’t make it a new chat, make it a notification. I’ll chat with them if i want. Integrated QR/Barcode reader/creator At the risk of creating controversy here is my request. Make Telegram end to end encrypted by default,  because Telegram is NOT a secure messaging app. Any messaging app that claims to care about privacy as its core value but doesn’t have E2EE by default is lying. I’ve read Telegram’s défense for why they don’t go the Signal way and it’s full of deception. The truth is Telegram wants to be popular, and to be popular you can’t have E2EE by default. This is from a longtime Telegram user. [Case in point. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/gm9k7h/is_my_privacy_protected_if_i_use_whatsapp_but/fr403u0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Inline stickers/custom ""emojis"".
I finally want to use my custom Blobs in text 😭 I'd like a better audio codec.
Thanks. unlimited chat folders.

currently it has limit 10 max chat folders The ability to transfer ownership of a sticker pack. The ability for a bot to edit a sticker pack without having _by_BotNameBot at the end of it. Slack like emoji reactions to messages. Desktop: be able to tag people from inside the 'send media' box. Tagging people from the normal message field and then pasting the media works, but it would be nice to not have to do it in a roundabout way I'm glad that they have multi-account support on desktop. 

I just wish I could shut off the notification that ""Your friend joined telegram""...

and not show up in my chats.


and a join link that is custom for private channels and groups. (People can't see what's inside besides the name, and they can join) SMS Integration on Android (like Signal or Messenger) Number 2 of OP should be a must. Nitpicking? Oh man, I want text sizing, big text would be shouting/excited and small text would be like whispering.

And what about dynamic text, when the letters shiver or wave groovily.

One can dream. per-contact chat background cause I often mix up who I am talking to. Having the background different would ""color-code"" it. Chat bubbles. Have an integrated money transfering system No 6 is in beta or experimental feature already Actionable notification buttons for bots. Probably not nitpick: be able to read text message to my audio and convert audio messages from other people to text for me. Also I really agree with the suggestions you listed, they would be useful 1 Is in Telegram X Android, 5 is in Telegram macOS, 6 I think is in developer options in Telegram iOS Add notification feature on edited posts. Some bits heavily rely on edits. Muting users in channels. >	6) Have an option to put the chat folder tabs in the bottom just like Messenger.

On iOS, if you go into the secret [Debug menu ](https://i.imgur.com/Ytp8D5n.jpg)(pressing “settings” 10 times) you can activate the [Alternative Tabs](https://i.imgur.com/aRrpYn5.jpg), if this is what you wanted. I don’t know if Android has this too, tho. Ability to disable the shit video player on desktop. - Message reactions.
- Not my cup of tea but maybe adding an option to enable E2EE by default but at the cost of disabling cloud sync.
- Add categories/channels on groups.
- More features to voice recordings like special effects. Have a gallery of special effects. Unique Group Chat / Channel Specific : Automatically download Images, Files, Videos, Video Messages, Audio Messages, GIFs, to specific folder. Setting would be available once entered into the group/channel. Not in main settings. Better download speeds.
Turn off notifications for contact joining. 
Better tag suggestions. To have the option of download an image, video or not. I mean, if I am in a group and I don't want to others dowload my images, they just can watch it in the group but they can't download it. See who has read messages in groups 1. Full screen desktop to be able to have my messages on the right and others on the left as windowed

2. Pinnable message per chat that works as a board with sticky notes and to-do list, editable by both users in the chat or admin/selected/all people in a group.


EDIT:    
• In a privacy settings something to prevent people to be able to delete my messages (or at least my copy) after X days/weeks that has been left untouched. comprehensive Messages

imagine it like blogposts but in normal Messages.
You can insert any Media inbetween any text line.
That way you can have an Image with Text above and below the Image.

I could Imagine it in a Fullscreen view for writing these messages. I actually made a post about this the other day. I would like to be able to mute conversations/chats but still get badge notifications. I just don't like the constant sounds and screen notifications, so being able to just have badges for muted chats would be great. It apparently used to be possible in the past, but they've since removed it. Time. Read. Please. Create a GIF instead of a video using the phone camera. Audio files waveform (not just audio messages). Bubble-free (aka [Telegram X-style chats](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/01/22/telegram-x-fast-alternative-telegram-client-experimental-features/#ap-lightbox) \-- far right on the picture vs vanilla telegram middle) chat settings with global defaults (i.e. all group chats, all bots, all channels, all chats) but chat-specific override (i.e. all group chats bubbleless except for this one). sub-channels! Text resizing!!! I used it on Allo all the time and miss it dearly **Proper blocking** \- if I block a user, and they're in a chat with me, I don't want them to be able to constantly ping me with notifications.  Currently desktop and Android clients allow this.

**Presence notification** \- I would LOVE a way to set an away/dnd status visible to others.

**Contact display names -** If someone I have saved as a contact changes their name in Telegram, I'd like to to be configurable to show this in the UI.  Several friends are using their name as a kind of half-assed presence notification (like ""John Smith \[BUSY - Back at 1800\]"" and I can't see those because I have them saved as a contact. I know that telegram stickers implementation is better than Whatsapp but what I really miss it the ability to add just one sticker from someone to my favorites and not having to add the entire sticker set, so I can have in one place all the stickers that I really like, but Telegram just allow 5 favorite stickers :( a better scrolling experience in telegram's desktop app for windows. currently it sucks ass. Custom border-radius for profile pictures! Rounded squares are superior to circles in every way.

A monochrome icon for ubuntu-mono-dark. Even better, just use the envelope icon (green = new messages, no counter). Or at least make icons separate, replaceable files again.

Also, I’d prefer if a shared YouTube video looked like it does in VK, with a full-width thumbnail and the name on the bottom, without a description, the “quote” bar on the left or the text saying “YouTube”. - EXPORT FEATURE(S) 
I regularly export articles from Medium app to Telegram and I can't find a way to export them!🙏 1.	New photo picker on iOS 14 (doesn’t prompt for permission; only shares selected photos when confirmed).
2.	Actually working Siri integration (currently it says “you need to continue in Telegram”).
3.	Continuity between iPhone and Mac (switching between devices in a middle of a call and handoff icon for opening current chat on other device).
4.	Picture in Picture for video calls in iOS 14 (like it works in FaceTime).
5.	Automatic light/dark appearance based on system wide setting on Windows/Linux (cross platform desktop client).
6.	Option to disable sending read receipts. Direct export from Whatsapp stickers into Telegram. Would switch like 99% of my friends to Telegram in a heartbeat. An option to disable read receipts. Please. I can't deal with it anymore. It does not fit Telegram privacy policy rules, but if anyone had used Vidogram, another client of Telegram, that app had a feature to see deleted messages or edited messages. For example, I dont like when somebody deletes all the chat content without informing me. Vidogram showed those deleted messages or audio or image even though the other side of the chat deleted them or edited them. This was a huge difference from official Telegram, but unfortunately now they have removed this feature. What I am saying is, I would like to have that feature back in Vidogram or adding this feature to Telegram even on a paid base. But  what are the odds of that happening? Disabling read receipts and ""online"" indicators This.

I have like 2 dozen stickers and the small bar isn't doing it for me anymore

&#x200B;

Also more favourite stickers but I guess that is a commonm request. Sticker search by something other than emoji. I've had numerous times I remember the name of the sticker set but can't just find it and end up not sending the sticker I wanted.

Nowadays I just use the emoji suggested ones... Yes please Yeah this would be nice. +100000 They should really transform the Saved Messages window into a list of messages counterpart to the original messages but one where you only message yourself. It's ridiculous but that's how people actually use it. As if we were messaging multiple people. I haven't had much chance to try it myself but @filetobot does something similar. An official integration would be perfect I second this.  A like button, A wow button, a cool post button.  Defiantly something that says ""hey I saw your post"". Nah, not needed

Use @like Whoever gave me this gold medal, thank you but seriously don't give money to reddit :/ This. What's the point of having folders if you still have the main one set as default.

At least an option to make it not open that one by default when the app opens would be nice. This alone is enough for Telegram to have a Notification Center. Friend request is a good one. Honestly, with this suggestion and the post regarding channels. I believe Telegram should streamline their service. I mean it is already powerful but they can make it more so.
They can make seperate sections for different aspects of the application such as
1 - Sticker Store - Think of an app store inside Telegram. With a multitude of customization options for searching. Also displays new, trending.
2 - Channel Center - Kind of like an app store also with new, trending and search.
3 - Bot Center - Also app store
4 - Group Center - For public search

They should give it the social media treatment even though it's only a messaging app because as it is, it is already a power app. Doing so would make it even more of one. Besides, I don't think Telegram needs to have a public social system like post or tweet as an excuse to design the application as if it was a social media. It can do it because it was always innovative. So this is funny.  I only knew to swipe to get to next media and have been doing that. So this exists! Group call is the only reason I use discord.

Also, number 2 on your list is already possible, isn't it? You can disable that kind of message in Settings -> Notifications You can do that if you ""send as file""? You can send any media as a file It's been here for a long time already Why not? Most of the features in Telegram screamed power user anyway so something like that is possible. but making it E2EE will loose the feature of cloud syncing and won't work on multiple devices. > and to be popular you can’t have E2EE by default.

Signal should be popular then, many people think otherwise. I don't use E2E and will want it disabled by default. I'm not alone there Who uses SMS in 2020? They seem to be working on this. It's already available on beta versions of the app.   

https://www.xda-developers.com/telegram-tests-floating-chat-head-bubbles-for-messages/amp/ As long as you can turn them off.... Never got the craze about them, I just find them annoying. But I hope we get a choice. [deleted] It's on ios only. On desktop you can change the width of the sticker are on the side. Up to 6 next to each other iirc, I have it on 5 just before they snap to 4 wide. Also you can already scroll. What I'd love to see would be more favorites!

For gifs on the other hand, maybe something like tagging? Similar to what emojis are for stickers perhaps? Yeah I guess more favorites is the solve-all solution, but I was also thinking about an option to ""hide"" stickers from a set. That way you can keep your sets but they'll cointain only the ones you use. Maybe even assign names to your favorite stickers so you can summon them while writing. i use a bot to accomplish that Doesn't work for group chats, even GroupMe has this its much quicker to just react with a thumbs up or heart than to send a message to @like and create a message with reactions Omg, don't give a gold medal on a comment where I ask people not to give money to reddit! xD Yeah, number 2 is indeed possible, lol. Though it seems like people who have your number in contacts will see it anyway, and you can do nothing about it. I probably meant ""who can find me by phone number"". Still doesn't disable for me or my entire family!! Very annoying Yes but the controls and media playback are different. it doesn't work if you are sharing from another app on android at least. you do not get to pick send as file option in this case. Did I miss it? Where? Don't get me wrong, I would love for that to happen one day. That's really the last thing that make me miss the old days of Live Messenger, with the exception of video calls, which are coming anyway. Most likely yes. Unless they work hard at making syncing work with E2EEE, which they are not because they don’t care about privacy. Signal is. Signal is popular but nowhere near as popular. My point is Telegram wants to be popular on the scale of WhatsApp. Ain’t nothing wrong with that. But they should stop pretending that they care about privacy. And that’s fine. My issue is with Telegram pretending they care about the privacy of our data when they don’t. They care more about popular and are willing to sacrifice our privacy for it, which they do. Friends and family without Telegram. Having two messaging apps can be confusing unless it's directly integrated in one spot. I don't always love to use them, but it's nice when I'm trying to multitask Maybe a blockchain integration could be it, just a simple interface within the app could be awesome, even though dark markets would follow... Which one? Settings - Data and Storage. Then turn off autodownload for certain type of connection I bet there's an inline bot for this... If you want to use Telegram and care about privacy you can use secret chats and there is no evidence Telegram encryption protocol has been hacked. When did they sacrifice your privacy? @QuickStickBot and @QuickGifBot You seem to not understand that: 

1. Most people don’t use secret chat and don’t want to. 

2. Telegram never being hacked doesn’t eliminate the issue that they have access to our data & metadata. They can read our messages, files we share and all our contacts, and expect us to just trust them with it. 

Most E2EE services like Signal, ProtonMail, and Tutanota tell us that we shouldn’t trust them blindly. That’s why they are open source and have E2EE by default. 

If you claim privacy as the core value to your service, then you care about collecting the least amount of data from your users. That’s not Telegram. 

If they did, they would invest and put in the effort it requires to develop an app that is E2EE by default but can also sync multiple devices, and hand gifs, etc...

Read the efforts that Signal puts into E2EE every single gif, sticker and emoji. It take a lot of efforts and time to develop that level of security. Telegram doesn’t do that. They don’t want to. Are you serious? You’ve read my request right? Not having E2EE by default sacrifices our privacy. > Most people don’t use secret chat and don’t want to. 

We need a source to back that up. I don't see how. The non-secret chats are still encrypted. They haven't been shared with anyone.

The biggest risk to privacy is someone gaining access to my phone. lol no official source needed. This is 120% common sense and if you have all your friends wanting to secret chat all the time then congrats, you have a privileged minority group unlike most of us The non secret chat are not *end to end encrypted* aka E2EE. Meaning Telegram can read your messages and collect data on you which they do. Exactly. I guarantee that as a Telegram user if you told all your contacts that you will not talk to them unless it’s in secret chat, the vast majority will say no. They LOVE Telegram desktop and the ability to have it on multiple devices too much to allow that. 

And even if they did, it doesn’t change the fact that Telegram collects our contacts when Signal doesn’t. And Telegram doesn’t end to end encrypt stickers, gifs & emojis like Signal does. Each and every set of those is heavily vetted  and re-engineered by Signal to make it secure and prevent them from reading your data. 

I’m not here to hate on Telegram users. I use Telegram, I just hate that they position themselves as privacy focused when it’s not true. Being merely better than Facebook is not good enough. 

Imagine if you have a house with everything you care about in it. If you got it from Facebook they have the keys to the door, and can come whenever, and collect whatever they want. And they absolutely do. 

If you got your house from Signal they cannot come in even if they wanted to. They cannot see through the windows, even if they wanted to. And they show you exactly how their security system works so anybody can vet it. 

If you got your house from Telegram, they can do everything that Facebook does, and they do, but they just don’t use it...so they say. Even if that is true I don’t want to be put into that position. Do you think telegram are mining your conversations? I don't. They have nothing to gain and everything to lose if they were found out. Telegram has the ability to read and collect our data which includes our contacts, our  messages and all the files we share on their platform. And guess what?  They absolutely read and collect that data. Whether they mine or monetize is irrelevant. It’s not enough for me to trust them or any company that claims privacy as their core value. 

The issue is that Telegram  has the power to do so because our data is not E2EE. Also Telegram is not a non profit. It is registered as an LLC, ie a business, which means that at any time in the present or future they can sell or monetize our data if they haven’t  done so already. We have no reason to trust them. Fair enough. I trust them more than I trust advertising companies like Google, and I still use Gmail. I understand that. Google & FB are the worst. But keep in mind that just because an app or service is better that Google & FB on privacy doesn’t mean they are actually good or worthy.

Unless you have evidence of the opposite, you must assume that ever internet based service or app, is in the business of collecting and monetizing your data, directly or indirectly. 

I was looking for a birthday reminder app, and found an amazing one in terms of UI & UX. But then I realized, shit, they want my data, and all that data of my contacts. So precisely because they are not E2EE, I ended up not using them even though part of me wants to, but not at the cost of my privacy. It’s the same for literally almost any app you can think of: Uber, Amazon, Calendar, podcasting apps, etc...it’s practically unavoidable. Well my point is that if gmail is good enough for me then telegram is also good enough for me. That makes sense. WhatsApp & FB should be good enough too then but I understand if you prefer Telegram. Yeah I use those too but telegram is much nicer."

Why Telegram's channel discovery lacks?;101;i3emi0;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/i3emi0/why_telegrams_channel_discovery_lacks/;17;I like telegram channels. But it's really hard to discover *new, trending and popular channels* in a particular language or category. For me, only way to discover a new channel is through friend recommendation. Wouldn't it be nice to have *top, trending, new channels list* in official dashboard. I know that unofficial services lists some of the channels, but the official service would be better.;2020-08-04 10:02:28;"I’m worried it might be abused easily. I keep getting messages promoting for “fake members” there should just be a public directory, or perhaps a way better keyword-based search [Great minds think alike](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/i0jo2z/-/fzs6p4y) There are some third-party websites. I use tgstat, but I'm not sure if it works with non-Russian channels That's a great idea. Although u can find top channels regarding any topic/language or whatever thru a search engine. But, getting it show in the app itself would be a better option. Yeah that would be great to see trending and new channel in dashboard
In telegram add this feature I've begun development of `@tgwavebot` a month ago. It searches on messages and sortes them according to their channels PageRank. As the first probe, it showed rather good results.

At the moment I've stopped uploading new messages as I'm doing large refactorings at the server side. This bot is coupled with `@libgen_scihub_bot` and using same technologies. There is a chance I'll close all hanging issues in days/weeks and will start uploading again. I hope I'll find time to implement some topic modelling and trending features after stabilizing main parts. You can use the search engine to search channels or groups, you just need to use the keyword like ""books"" and other letter from the alphabet and keep changing [Telegram search books](https://i.imgur.com/Mlu2Tbz.jpg) Well, I think one of job description of the engineers is about preventing abuse of the complex systems. :) Also, great redditors steal (/sarcasm (I wasn't aware of your comment until now)) Just checked... nice little directory. It does have an option to only show English channels... but it doesn't work. A few channels I looked at were in Russian (or similar language).

It would be a nice site if it expanded to other regions/languages (properly), had a dark mode, and had a way to jump right to the channel without the details page. Are you developing it as open source bot?

And how do you aware of new public channels? >tgstat

It's extraordinary useful, actually, but I found it a little abandoned - I just had this kind of vibe, but maybe I'm wrong - so now I'm using both tgstat and Lyzem. It does not have a dark mode, but yeah, there are billions of channels, bot, groups and (ALSO) Telegraph pages, which is awesome! I'd like to make it open source, but it is rather complicated as it consists of about 10 microservices. Nevertheless, I have plans to open source some parts a little bit later.

I have a crawler parsing channels in a specific order based on the last visit time, PageRank (or ChannelRank?) and post frequency. If the crawler meets a repost of a message from an unknown channel or a mention of such channel, it schedules parsing of this new channel with a higher priority. It is absolutely the same way of how web-crawlers work. Tgstat is not abandoned, Tgstat and Telemetr are biggest Russian channel catalogs, a lot of people use them Oh, I see! Sorry for that, I didn't want to sound offensive, but I guess I did without noticing. But I'm serious when I say that tgstat is incredible! It gives a lot of statistics that you can't find anywhere else and it's always updated with the latest channels, groups and bots.

Also, I didn't know about Telemetr *at all*! I'm checking it out and wow, I'm shocked O.O"

Thanks TG god I wish. the only way is to not sync your contacts (optional: use a burner number to register an account) and then > set phone number privacy to nobody > set discovery to my contacts)

no contacts, no one will discover you have an acc. Telegram is working on this feature, to include nobody option. Maybe in future updates. I had this trouble recently. 

When I opened my account I had the contact syncing enabled. After sometime in the Telegram settings I:

1) in ""data settings"" disabled **sync contacts**  
2) in ""data settings"" clicked **delete synced contacts**  
3) ""who can find me by my number"" set to **my contacts**  


Supposedly there are no my contacts in Telegram database and I have disabled access to my contacts, thus nobody can find me. But couple of days ago my friend who had my number (and also whose number I didn't have) but didn't have telegram account before, registered in telegram and texted me there. What the hell this privacy is? Well you can delete that chat for both ends, but yeah i hate that feature. Should be a way to control visibility from your contacts I hope so. Keeping the same settings, if you migrate to your personal number, it won't be shown to your contacts. Source? Nah, I'd see that more as a case of ""delete for me.""

After a harrowing few minutes he remembered that he was logged in on his laptop. That's not how that works. It should load everything as soon as you log in.

If you mean you are still logged in on another device, you should get a  message from telegram to allow the new device to access the account. yes it does, the issue is that it asks for a cloud password which i dont have You created tbe password therefore you should have it.

If it's asking for a cloud password then you aren't actually logged in to the account on the new phone."

The app limits you to either sending silently or scheduling. You can do it in channels, though. Just turn off notifications for users and schedule a message, it will arrive silently. you can w Telegram X So if you long-press in personal chat on the send button, the ""Send without sound"" and ""Schedule message"" must appear. You can do it in telegram desktop too :)"

Mute forever .... !

I like I wish I could delete WhatsApp, but friends, family, etc... 

Da\*n it! People using WS more than a better tool for the same synthesises perfectly how stupid humans are. Whatsapp makes more money than telegram
Still they don't work for improvement.
Go to play store & you will see
Not just telegram every decent rated messenger app is better than whatsapp. Once Telegram introduces encryption as standard to all chats, it will be super superior to Whatsapp. Video call anyone? I would compromise on such features over security. still waiting for discord to up their file upload size for non-nitro users... :c same, I wish everyone would switch to telegram instead so i could get rid of that green shit forever It used to be like that right from the beginning. There were already messengers out there with much much better features back in 2009 like multiple points of presence, video call support, open protocols and proper desktop apps like ICQ and MSN.

WhatsApp was like texting. That's why people preferred it. Humans are not stupid. We'll always choose what's better and what works better for us, the thing is, this is an app that basically no one near us know. 

Many people in my country are increasingly joining and talking about the app. It's just a matter of time and users. [deleted] Please no, If that happens, I'll leave telegram cause no syncing across all clients. [deleted] It is already superior since whatsapp backup are in plaintext on third party cloud. You have to trust facebook plus google or apple.  for me that is the only thing missing. When I try to evangelize someone for a telegram, the first thing they notice is that. Already does that wHatSaPp iS tHe mOsT sEcuRe mEsSaGinG aPp iN tHe wOrLd. 

Well, Zuckerberg owns it so it has to be secure. They won't.  They need your $10/mo! Fucking this Well. I don't intend to go deeper in the subject, but how we treat the world and how our society works even knowing that there are better ways of living within this planet, as society we are stupid. I'm talking about collective intelligence. It is mean to be a public comment... Whereas is not the case in a private conversation app... With PIN and SVR features, you have to trust signal server too (they are e2ee just in theory [link1](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/07/10/a-few-thoughts-about-signals-secure-value-recovery/) and [link2](https://palant.info/2020/06/16/does-signals-secure-value-recovery-really-work/)). At the moment signal upload contacts and settings. If in the future, signal will upload your chat history in the cloud, there will be not pratice difference between them. They could still do that. You could actually handle it a bit like a password manager with a password derived key. They can do multiple clients and E2EE. Signal does it, so why not Telegram? Wrong. Signal has both. Use secret chats? They're e2ee You have to trust Telegram in exactly the same way as your chats are decryptable by them. It's already accessible via developer settings It uses the Signal Org's Open Whisper System encryption protocol which open source and open for audits  anyday and implemented in WhatsApp by folks at Signal 

https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/ [deleted] Signal only syncs going forward though. If I get a new phone it will only sync new messages. Telegram has all my chat history when I go onto a new phone/web browser/etc. That alone pushes me away from Signal. [removed] [removed] So what? No hackers can read what you're writing to your friends?

WhatsApp (ie facebook) can still read your messages, since they control both endpoints. Also, hackers can utilize the inbuilt backdoors to access your device; and they won't be discovered since the app is closed source.

Sure, telegram also has problems in that they (telegram) can read and access all your data on their servers, so you really have to trust them. Unless, of course, your are using secret chats.

I wish Telegram could be as secure as Signal by default, but unfortunately the technology isn't there yet. You still have to offer some security for functionality or vice versa.

For me Signal feels at best like a beta product at this point with the frequent bugs and people just plain not getting notifications (a problem I have with every single contact that uses Signal). So I can't use it as a main messenger. I use a mix of Telegram and Signal. You lose so much quality when having E2EE as a default, because any feature related to multiple devices is disabled, since it's E2EE. I rather having decent encryption and all these features **with the option of having a secret chat** than needing it all to work only when my phone is connected, and everything runs through the phone [deleted] Please read my links. SVR and PIN features allow you to upload contacts and settings and then to recover them into a new installation (in future history chat too). They are the foundation of username support. Unfortunately, they are flawed since are based on enclave security. So you have to trust the server and, in practice, they invalidate e2e encryption. [deleted] Same problem with Telegram.

• Telegram too closed source.

Infact their encryption aren't open source but totally proprietary and no security researchers have able to inspect those!! Vs Open Whisper System encryption is open for inspections and security researchers and security enthusiast can able to find any loopholes so basically OWS loophole can be fixing in open manner. Here Telegram encryption is proprietary so loopholes will be unfixed!!

• The article you've suggested suggest not to trust Telegram as they can read the Messages once it's in Telegram servers so I don't know how exactly it becomes more secure than WhatsApp?

And Protected backups are coming on Whatsapp, meanwhile I don't use cloud backup, I skip that and use only local backup! Why don't you use more secret chats on Telegram? [deleted] Multiple device support with E2EE is coming which will replace the current method where you don't have to rely upon your phone connection for decryption! [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] No. Telegram client and protocol are open source and you can check what the code is actually doing. Moreover, telegram provides [reproducible builds](https://core.telegram.org/reproducible-builds).

No. The telegram stack protocols is open source [MTproto](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto).

On telegram you can choose: cloud chat and secret e2ee chat. The first are stored in plaintext on telegram server while the second are only stored in you devices.

The problem with whatsapp is that your contacts are using cloud backup on therefore your message are in the cloud.

*“About 75% of WhatsApp users are on Android, and of our Android users, we have about 40% of them opted into Google Drive backups today. That will likely continue to increase over time, as people get prompted.”* [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-phQXGhrLQ&t=19m5s) They are device specific, and you can only start one on your phone. I don't like writing on my phone and much prefer doing it on my laptop. Oh that's cool I didn't know that. I hope this does get to Telegram Are you basically claiming that the whole HTTPS protocol is useless lol Please read again what I wrote. You have to trust signal server, since they can access to flawed SGX enclave.

Please quote the all interesting sections: *But now the US government could go to Intel, which also happens to be based in the US, and ask them to sign keys for a malicious enclave. That malicious enclave could then get into the data replication process and thus extract all the secrets. No more rate limiting, decrypting data with simple passwords is easy and very fast.*

*Either way, all of this only matters if we (the users) can verify that Signal’s secure enclaves work exactly as advertised. Meaning: the values required to decrypt the data will only be provided to the rightful owner, without any backdoors to circumvent the rate limiting mechanism. As long as this cannot be verified, we are back to trusting Signal.* No, read my links. You have to trust the server and the e2ee is not reliable. The use of the https protocol is to prevent outsiders from the conversation between you and the server to get the data.  
This means you, and the server, get the plaintext data, but the tube to transmist it is encrypted.  
The issue he is raising is that once the data is on the server, they are not encrypted, and they have full access to it.  
On the other hand, if you encrypt it locally, then it's encrypted both during transmission AND on their server.  
  
Then they can't use your data for ""analytics"" or to sell it. [deleted] [deleted] Messages are encrypted on Telegram's servers but Telegram servers also hold the keys. I don't know where you see that messages are stored in plaintext...  
   https://telegram.org/privacy#4-1-storing-data  
  
Also, server-client encryption is used in Telegram cloud chats, nothing is transferred in plaintext.  
 
https://core.telegram.org/techfaq#q-how-does-server-client-encryption-work-in-mtproto Signal server can read your data. Are you just reading some sentences? Me or you? Do you trust flawed SGX enclave of intel CPU? You have to trust signal server, you cannot refuse the truth.

*Either way, all of this only matters if we (the users) can verify that Signal’s secure enclaves work exactly as advertised. Meaning: the values required to decrypt the data will only be provided to the rightful owner, without any backdoors to circumvent the rate limiting mechanism. As long as this cannot be verified, we are back to trusting Signal.* [deleted] This is false. You have to trust signal servers about how they handle your data. They have access to SGX enclave by exploiting the weakness.

If it wasn’t a secret chat, then the other person probably deleted it. I don’t know if you know this but anyone can clear a conversation for both sides even if it was over 48 hours old. That is unfortunate, the conversation was supposed to serve as a proof for something crucial but if anyone can just delete the whole thing then I guess this is not the app anyone would want to use for things like that. Yes anyone can delete any messages for both parties. For privacy reasons. You can save/export any conversation on telegram desktop.

I filed some bugs asking for basic VoiceOver accessibility fixes on iOS. none of those have been fixed in the past year, but now I can't read anything in the settings screen.;79;i1j9tk;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/i1j9tk/i_filed_some_bugs_asking_for_basic_voiceover/;17;"Popular operating systems include many accessibility options, including a screen-reader mode that translates the text on-screen into speech or Braille. This is mostly an automatic process, but does require the cooperation of developers for nonstandard controls such as the ones used in Telegram. These controls need an ""accessibility label"" so that the screen-reader will read their name. This is normally fine: iMessage, Skype (sort of), Messenger, WhatsApp, Signal, Threema, and many other messaging apps have used good accessibility standards in their design process and they are great to use. Over the past two years, Telegram has developed some small problems, but has remained largely usable until the update that came out today, which took away VoiceOver's ability to read the settings screen. Where I would normally touch one of the list items and hear its name, I now touch it and hear nothing.

The blind community spent a long time trying to get Telegram developers to notice us enough to make even the most basic changes that would allow us to read messages. I was hopeful that would continue, but it seems as though things are just slowly slipping back into a different kind of inaccessible.

I've tried chatting with support, tweeting, posting here, and posting in the iOS testing group. Unfortunately if I don't catch a bug while it's still in the beta builds, I can no longer bring it up in the group, which takes away a major channel of communication to the developers.

I believed in this app enough to suggest that my entire network of Twitter followers switch to it. I now have dozens of contacts online or active within the last 24 hours--most of them completely blind like me and also using VoiceOver. This is a user-hostile development process and I am beyond frustrated at having to make the choice between having a bad experience on iOS and switching to yet another messaging app. It's lazy development, it shuts out a growing number of users, and I'm pretty sure it's illegal in more than one major country. We are cast aside because the interface is considered ready-for-release as long as it ""looks"" fine. I'm pretty sure nobody actually believes blind people should just be excluded from being able to use their app, but this is the impression we are left with after making numerous attempts to reach out and being greeted by an inaccessible settings screen. If I ever want to reinstall the app, I won't be able to do so. If I ever want to set a passcode or change notification sounds or add an account, I won't be able to do that either. Actually, if I want to contact support, that also won't be possible.

I don't expect perfection. I've been fine with some unlabeled buttons throughout the app that somehow haven't gotten fixed over the last two years. I've been fine with the fact that if someone sends me a message with an emoji and it shows up as animated, I won't be able to read it. I've been fine with the fact that the entire passcode keypad is unlabeled and I just have to figure out where the numbers are as I punch them in. None of this is great, but it's ""fine"".

But this ... this is exhausting. Why is the most basic of testing not happening? Where is the disconnect between concise bug reports and a continuing development process that creates even more accessibility problems? I don't kid myself into thinking that switching everyone in my contact list to another app would actually put a dent in Telegram's user base. So maybe that's the problem. Maybe this is like a bad relationship and I should just accept that nothing's going to change because it's hard to make some basic changes and easy to wait until we get tired of all the issues and just disappear.";2020-08-01 03:52:40;"What can we do to help? I didn't know there was such a problem for the blind community, that must suck. [deleted] Very similar sentiments to OP.

Blind user of Telegram, although I have to admit I mostly use it through a 3rd-party Windows app.

iOS used to be entirely unusable, got better but is now slowly regressing. For now, we still have workarounds for some things. But if this keeps getting as little attention as it's apparently getting, we'll have to give it up as a sinking ship. 

It's frustrating, it's honestly quite dehumanizing to essentially be told by the actions of a company that we apparently aren't ""normal"" enough to have the privilege of using an app, but that is essentially exactly what's happening.

I'm a fully blind back-end developer with a bachelor in IT, and yet ...I can't switch a setting off and on because someone decided they needed to step away from the established iOS standard controls and to hell with the consequences. I'm tired having to justify my existence as a target group,and yet if we don't, we'll never get anywhere. Man, that really sucks and feels like a huge miss. I hope they respond and do something about this. It's not like blind people are that tiny of a minority, some accommodation for them would be very nice. Same thing for someone I know who can‘t see well. When selecting text in a Telegram message there‘s no way to speak text (a feature available in other popular chat apps). I complained about this already a couple of years ago, to no avail honestly, twitter or volunteer support. GH issues/PR’s are usually ignored Hello!

Can you please check your direct messages, i dropped you a message there. All the best with this OP, I hope you can get their attention and get them to fix it. File a github issue. I think that is the main way to get their attention. ""i'm actually not sure. I think the only thing I have yet to do is file an issue about this on GitHub. That may be the only way to get developer attention, so I'll do that. Thanks. I agree it's not that hard; I have no idea how this keeps happening but Telegram is far from the only one to do it. What kind of programs have you made, if you can say? too much to test, too little time i guess. marketing team has very strict deadlines and very specific needs for the new features. keep in mind, there’s only one main dev working on the app. Thanks. I definitely hope they do too. Another commenter just asked about other accessible apps, and I realized how far behind Telegram is. I have tried both. Volunteer support and I spent hours filing tickeffs for pretty much every issue I could find. The developers are either ignoring or not reading them. Thank you; I definitely hope so too. Seems like they've taken a vow of silence. That's what I'll do. Only reason I haven't is because I talked with their support, who has their own ticketing system. Apparently that's not reliable. I will try Twitter and Telegram support then. Hope it gets worked on. [deleted] yes, but do you have to accomplish such things while fielding bug reports + being QA for an app that millions of people will use? because the dev has to do everything themselves - check bug reports, code, implement new features, implement bug fixes, do QA, etc. basically everything a (minimum) 5 person team would have to do at a normal company."

This would mean that T knows already the contacts of one who has not joined T yet.

Any idea? Thanks in advance.";2020-07-31 17:25:38;"It doesn't mean contacts in common.

It's pretty easy at this point to know how many people have a certain number or not."

Changing ROMs every month and used to losing data on a weekly basis. If it weren't because of migrate or titanium backup. I would always lose some bits of my chats cuz of whatsapp terrible backups that take so long to load too.

Telegram ftw Whatsapp SUCKS And try moving between Android and iOS... What""TheHells""App sucks!!! ehhhhhhh... i deleted A MESSAGE to my SO two days ago. all of a sudden the complete chat was lost. No way of recovery. Deleted at both devices.

either I completely mislicked and hit clear history or that was a bug on telegram macos.

either way, I lost more than a year of lovely chats with my SO. With whatsapp I'd have at least any backup or any way to get my messages, plus I'd have the option to export chats.

Don't get me wrong, I love telegram to death, but this meme is about backups. And backups are straight not possible with telegram. Mandatory upvote and nod of approval Oh such a burn Happy cake day! Obligatory comment saying that this is only possible because telegram is not encrypted and they have access to the messages.

But yeah WhatsApp backups outside gdrive are shit. I lost all my stickers because of their crappy Backup system, and I hate how it keeps increasing in size every freaking week by hundreds of megabytes and takes longer to backup every time. 

Thank god I convinced my girlfriend to switch to Telegram (at least to chat with me). Obbligatory sub-comment specifying that whatsapp web without cell not connected is worst af My boss went from iOS to Android and lost all of it. Nope. No recover. There's no way to recover an iOS backup from an Android.

https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/i0ewwq/telegram_files_eu_antitrust_complaint_against/fzp5vn5/ Forcing Apple to allow installation from other sources, in their own os would be not only unlawful but very stupid. If Apple wants to take a 30% cut just like google does on the play store, and want to force users not to be able to officially download apps from other sources they have every right to do so as it’s their platform. I understand if it was the only existent platform, but it isn’t and if someone is so unhappy they fight in the court for that then they aren’t doing something right. They should just switch to android, because it’s just basically trying to force a business not to do something that it wants and has every right to do. Apple is a greedy and evil company. And they have tons of sheep to defend them. I find it telling that Durov has started pressing on this issue after his TON blockchain project collapsed and he had to return millions of dollars to investors. That money, and his personal fortune, have been keeping Telegram running for the last few years. 

I can't help but think that he has started to focus on ways to monetise the app - despite what he may have said in the past - and doesn't want to share any of the revenue with Apple or Google. I think apple do that because of security for their users, apple is known to have a quality over quantity on its appstore. That 30 percent tho is ridiculous I think the app store has to reamin the only app platform. It’s the only thing that keeps IOS safe. Sorry durov but I hope apple never allows other stores >Apple must “allow users to have the opportunity of downloading software outside of the App Store”.

True, but I have no idea how this can help Telegram. All of this is true. They even restricted Valve from putting up Steam Link app because they feared it'd competition as it allows to play Steam games on your phone. I agree with this wholeheartedly. I love Telegram and praise it as one of, if not the, best messaging apps available right now. But, the fact that Durov has a vendetta against the App Store because it wouldn’t allow the App on until they either removed/restricted the adult content or added a filter to be able to turn off that material (Durov decided to restrict NSFW for iOS instead or including it as a filter option) is becoming a bit of an eye roll situation. It seems as tho Durov just doesn’t like to be told to follow someone else’s rules and thinks that they “must” do it his way or else he’ll do what he has done with this complaint against Apple. Like you said, it is Apple’s platform after all and for him to say that they “must” change the regulations because he doesn’t like them is a bit silly. Obviously he knows the number of people that he can gain access to by being on the App Store so this is just his way of almost eating his cake and having it still. We’ll have to wait and see how this plays out. I see your point, but disagree. If every business did their thing on the grounds that it is THEIR business, we would have a much more isolated market of competition in today's industry - They CAN do it, sure, but it's attacks like this that stem for a better way of going about things, it may seem aggressive, but it gets gears moving, I think that's the main point. For instance, I dislike Epic Games, but the recent fiasco between them, Apple and Google, reminds me of just that.

I think the fact of the matter is, most users by now have become conformed to a specific ecosystem - Be it Apple's, Android's, or otherwise dependent on Platform - And most users do not know how Apple's current practices are likely impacting the growth, development and innovation of their favorite apps - And this is Telegram's way of fighting that and try to steer for an alternative where developers have more control over their own apps within whichever ecosystem in an effort to be exposed to the largest number of users possible.If businesses do their own thing, and even monopolize within their own solution with no ""openness"", it hurts developers as much as us users looking for an ever-improving app experience. 

Saying there are better ecosystems out there is true, but it doesn't wash away the fact that most users at the end of the day aren't interested in the politics Telegram is a part of, and likely won't switch just because of it - They're interested in how much Telegram can improve their communication needs, and will only stick to it for as long as it delivers on that.

Telegram is just one example, but it stretches from ""Appstore quarrels"" to shutting down TON, yet the outcome of every battle reverberates. Good catch. That's somber but ultimately would be good for everyone It is the exact same for many other platforms: [the play store has a 30% service fee](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622?hl=en), so does [steam](https://www.quora.com/Valve-company-What-percentage-does-Steam-keep-from-sales?share=1) too apparently. Apple isn't really doing anything different in that case, except that you can't (easily) sideload applications. I disagree...becaise there is still soooo many shit apps in the app store. Quality would mean to me: no ads, no tracking, also in free apps. As long as Apple is not changing its policy, the app store will not have ""quality"" Yeah. I don't see Apple allowing third-party apps any time soon. I also can't imagine the EU trying to enforce it.

I didn't quite understand what gaming thing Telegram tried to build. I can imagine Apple in an attempt to enforce a unified app experience saying that a messenger app is not supposed to be a gaming platform. Not sure what to make of this. I see where you're coming from, the app store should be the only official app store considering apple is quite vigorous with how they approve their apps and if anyone could install another app store with thousands of viruses. However if someone buys their device they should be able to do whatever the fuck they want on it including install whatever they want. How can an optional addition hurt your safety? You're implying users can't take care of themselves? Android is doing fine while allowing that to happen, just allow people to use their brain to decide for themselves, it's fine... What about OSX? U can install software without AppStore and it is still safe. [deleted] Apple store right now is what Steam was 14 years ago. The Tim Cook argument here actually fits Steam. https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features. It's laughable how bad the app store is for the being the sole storefront of the most popular phone OS in US (second most popular in the world), but I guess that's what you get when you're a literal monopolist with no competition. Steam isnt capable to stop anyone from going to something like epic games store or the vendors original store and buying a game. 
You could always use other app stores on android. Some manufacturers even had their own stores inbuilt into the system (samsung has had one for example. Idk if they still do)
If you ever try to install a app via an APK, you get a pop up telling you what needs to be enabled and that the app isnt trusted. 

Installing non app store apps on ios on the other hand...

This point made by telegram isnt saying that steam or google are good guys. They are just pointing out how insane it is that you HAVE to pay apple a cut of any transactions made on an ios device. Ads isn't a quality issue, is it? Apps that have ads usually offer a way to pay for an ad-less experience, which is completely reasonable.

As for tracking, next to other companies Apple is on the very front of protecting user information. Next step for Apple would be to block any http requests from an app without a user's notice. Don't really know how they’re supposed to change their policy to increase ""quality"". Yeah, just look at the insane amount of “great” apps on the play store and outside of it. Staggering.

Having no quality control and allowing malicious apps with all kinds of tracking techniques is definitely an amazing idea. Apple devices work like this. You want different? Buy android. There’s your consumer choice If someone wants to do whatever he wants he should buy an android. If you instead want to just be safe and not worrying about anything than buy an iPhone Well viruses are the main thing that spreads with alternative stores. And having third party app stores implies that an ad can install any app on your phone. That’s why I switched to IOS The kind of people who would even think to install a third party app store and know how to do so are generally savvy enough to stay safe. Obviously there are exceptions, but like you said it hasn't jeopardised the platform like Apple are claiming it would. Your mistake lies in assuming most people use their brain like you do. >save your comments about ""home grown encryption/not on by default""

I hate such comments myself. [deleted] What if you want the better camera optimisation in Instagram or Snapchat? What if you want the Apple ecosystem? What if you just simply like the software or hardware? Maybe you want iMessage? What if you like Apple's business model?

Those choices dictates why a lot of people get iPhones. Both platforms have much to be desired from each other and I see the alternate side of the ""apple should have control over what is on their hardware"" however if someone simply wants one of the many features that comes with a iPhone, they shouldn't be limited by whether the phone manufacturer feels like they should be able to download. If I buy the hardware I should be able to do whatever the fuck I damn well please with it. Apple isn't being sued because consumers don't have a choice for phones, they're being sued because developers don't have a choice for App Distribution on iOS and Apple uses this to enforce anticompetitive practices.  

Apple forces developers to pay their 30% fee or shuts them out.  Developers aren't allowed to let people sign up for their services in-app, unless Apple is paid the fee.  Developers are also banned from linking people to sign up online, or even mentioning the option to sign up online exists.  Their options are 'Pay Apple 30% of all purchases' or 'Allow people to pay online, but customers aren't allowed to know it exists'. What if they want to own an iPhone? Personally as an Android user I can think of many reasons why someone would want an iPhone over an Android. It's mainly all just preference, what features you use the most, but overall, someone shouldn't be locked down by which phone they choose to buy. android is a free operating system, you don't need to buy it. Alternative stores can build trust in long run, and create more competition. It will be completely optional, no one has to install a third party store if they don't want. Android is allowing it right now and there isn't any big issues. I forgot the link to the report about successfully hacking Telegram secret chats, could you please find it for me? Why the fuck should anyone be forced to cater to what anyone wants? Android is great, I love it! There are some things which I like about iOS too, however for my use Android is great for me. We're generally just taking about Apple locking down people's ability to do what they want on their own hardware. I should buy a phone based on its features and hardware, not whether the manufacturer will or won't let me use my hardware as I please. It’s not a trust question, durov is implying that anyone should be able to have an alternative store and that would open a huge security breach on IOS.

I understand the urge of being able to download free apps and everything but I would spend every penny I have on apps rather than having to worry about what I install.

Oh and another thing, having third party installed apps would stop the icloud backup cause it can’t backup downloads that are not from the appstore Anyone should be able to buy whatever device they want. I've been using Android for years however there are certainly some features of iPhones which make me consider switching.

The software shouldn't be locked down just simply because apple doesn't want to play nice with companies and other apps.

I should be able to buy whatever phone I want based on its hardware and not be bothered by how much I'll be restricted by the manufacturer ON THE HARDWARE THAT I OWN AND BOUGHT.

I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt to see where you're coming from, and I do, the main appstore shouldn't just let every single app through the floodgate in order to protect users, however for those of us who want to download certain non-appstore apps we should be able to do whatever we want without limitations. All I'm saying is having an option is not a threat, if you don't feel safe you simply can avoid installing any third party stores."

After that, you must subscribe to channel to continue viewing it.

To have this feature, channel must have 200+ subscribers and no linked groups. You still can, it's an option set by the owner. Generally, they want to see who is coming into their channel, and they may need this option set to ban users.

Just crank up your privacy settings, so other members can't get at your phone number mostly, but check over every privacy option and set it according to your privacy needs. Oh that's why, I hope more people could see this, I hope also we could find a way to continue see without joining for privacy purposes... I already did that, but they still will or can ban me, seeing me like an intruder, is there a way to fix this? Another account? So get a throwaway texting number (there are a number of apps that offer this) and make a Telegram account with it. Then put a username and password on it. Delete the texting service. Or, do it with a burner. There are a number of ways to accumulate multiple Telegram accounts, and the official app even lets you switch (previously, you needed a third party app to do that)."

Samsung devices had an issue where that would happen, since the OS would throttle the processor if your finger was not on the screen (Android dev called it the ""Windows 95 Mode""). 

could be a similar thing, or your device's processor is simply not powerful enough to handle animated stickers. but in that case, it should only be animated if the chat screen and you're not scrolling. when scrolling/viewing packs, the stickers will remain stationary. if your device's lack of horsepower is the issue, then the app should cache the stickers (so it should only play slowly for the first time, then after downloading and caching it, it should run at normal speed afterwards) While scrolling through packs they all move as they should and all at the same time. If it was my device wouldn't it happen with all the animated stickers? Some of them work just fine then it’s probably a heavy sticker that lags on basically all devices until it’s cached. afterwards, it’ll play normally."
A cartload of things Telegram would rather us have than video calls;118;i01hzo;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/4g0xnnt42td51.jpg;40;;2020-07-29 17:19:57;"They are testing the Videocalls, the iOS app has proof of that. I trust in Telegram and i know they will deliver in the time. And even with all that, the changes inside the app with every update just make things better, the experience is really fluid in the Android app with every update and that deserves some love too. Kudos for them for being aware and having some sense of irony about it...

Seriously though, I'd rather they do it well than rush and half ass it. And them delivering a slew of new features in the meantime actually increases my confidence in them, because that means they do have the resources to deliver on multiple (feature) project deliverables at the same time, which in turn means they're not a 3 person operation out of someone's mom's backyard shack :) They are working on it. What else do you want? An unfinished feature just for the sake of it?

edit: nvm I didn't see the tooltip. I am an idiot. Why is there demand for video calls? I've never understood the appeal. WE NEED GROUP VOICE CALLS INSTEAD OF VIDEO CALLS. They said it, not me Yeah I’m not sure why any of those things were high priority items. Give me group audio and video calls, figure out E2E encryption across multiple devices by default, and show me read notifications on a per user basis on group chats Maybe video calls are hard?   IDK.  Just a hunch. They are on the way, read [this](http://tginfo.me/tg-webrtc-en) and [this](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/tgcalls). Maybe it's just me but I find the reliability of the voice calls super sporadic. On wifi it's a total shit show to see if I'll connect in the first place, and if I have under 90+ % max signal strength I'll often drop the call or have it interrupt Videocalls are not the great thing... Its not a priority for many of us. So why the bad vibes if they deliver pretty good things with every update... Besides, videocalls are coming so... I'd also appreciate supporting group voice calls because then I would not have to rely on WA/FB messenger that much I hate video and audio calls and audio in general. Fuck emojis too. Text mode ASCII forever Sorry about the horrible quality picture, I couldn't take a screenshot of it on my computer with the message showing Yup...  I mean, Discord has had them from pretty much the beginning, so the fact that that functionality is STILL missing from Telegram is actually mildly infuriating.  Sure, having a 2GB limit for sharing files (which I'm thankful Telegram gives to everyone unlike Discord, with which you have to get Nitro gives to send more and its only a paltry 100MB). 0 out of 10 for effort I'm just wondering about the qualitative standards of those calls. They must be 8K or something along the lines, if it took forever to develop a beta They know once they'll put it out everyone will try and judge, so things need to be reaaaally smooth right from the start. It's a good thing they take their time, we're still growing! :) Wait, how do you get to the video calling option?  I'm on the Telegram TestFlight but I'm not seeing such an option.  Is it because the recipient has to also be on the TestFlight beta to see said option too? Check the post, it's actually a quote from the Telegram team that appears if you hover on the blog post image, those are not OP words It's quite useful, especially in times like this. Personally though, I rarely use video calls so this doesn't really bother me. For me, it's a nice-to-have, but it's not very important. But I can tell that there are people who want this feature, especially since this feature is almost universally present in other chatting apps. It's also the biggest feature that they lack compared to other messaging apps. And yeah, it's become super vital thanks to coronavirus locking people in their homes. Now everyone needs video calls to see their loved ones. I agree. For me are a nice-to-not-have since I hate videocalls and have been using Telegram to avoid them. When they implement them, I will need to find another way to avoid those waste of time. Oops... I didn't read the image caption underatted easteregg You can just press either Win + Print Screen or Win + Shift + S, you know It's called screenshot your computer's image than send it to yourself through Telegram Desktop or even email and THEN post it onto here. SMH You seem like an expert in software development sir I don't think you should be downvoted for this. Video calling has been around for years in other apps. What is Telegram doing differently that's made it take so long? It's a debug option in the Telegram for iOS version by now. Both, caller and recipient must have the option enabled. Down this sub you can find more info about that. Oh.. I am an idiot. But it took the cursor and the message away when I did that OP is saying that the act of taking a screenshot causes the tooltip to disappear. This is a common problem and it's solved by using the 3-second-delay feature in Windows' screenshotting tool. It's integrated into the secret chat system. That means e2e encryption and that takes a while because they have to reinvent the wheel to encrypt new data structures with their proprietary MTProto. However, that's already done and they're now probably optimizing. Probably not 8k tho lmao yep, that's exactly what I was asking. Thanks for understanding The cursor, yes, but not the message Exactly I hope that doesn't mean video calls won't be available on desktop. Thy will definitely come on phone first. Desktop is built on TDLib and I'm not sure how easy it is to set up that kind of stuff there."

Last telegram release has a new feature, if you start receiving messages from non-contacts, those will be muted and archived, so you won’t realize strangers texted you. You’ll notice when you go into archived chats THANK YOU, as a girl, this is almost a necessity in every chatting app. Some guys may act all offended and prude and say guys would never... Ok, cool story bro. I'm the one who gets the d pics and insults if I don't give them attention, plus my other girl friends. Sure, it's dramatically less than in Kik but regardless harassment shouldn't be accepted in no amount! Guys go as far as passing usernames to others!!!! Because tell me please, how often do you get private messages from random people? I personally can't see any reason why that would be needed, since random people don't tend to start a secret chat with me out of the blue. Because what if you don't save all your contacts (new contacts) If you have those people numbers in your contacts and you turned on option “My contacts” then those people aren’t strangers for you Also, why can't we disable the read receipts ?  


Sorry for hijacking your post but it really annoys me. If you want privacy use Signal, if you want stickers use Telegram, don't waste your time. Never Will be available 👍 Maybe some „hey, this person is trying to contact you“ mechanism like in Skype use the new ""archive and mute automatically"" feature When you get a message from someone who isn't in in your contacts, there's a ""report spam"" button at the top. If they send you unsolicited dick pics then for sure report them for spam. This will disable their telegram account for a while and they also won't be able to message you. don't have a public username, if you don't want to receive messages from random strangers. Don't write like a girl, don't say you are a girl, don't have females as a profile photo. Btw, there are user scripts you can have so people have to be approved when messaging you. You can even contact Telegram about that and they will legitimate help you. My best buddy got harassed and now suddenly everything stopped. It's useful for admins in support groups. I'm moderator in a group with 4.2k and 5.1k members, respectively. It's absolutely annoying to have people jump into PMs.

I'm all for this setting. It is *very* needed. Telegram has a huge problem with spam bots that roam groups finding their next target. I get random users sending me PMs almost every 2 days (and it's never for a legitimate purpose). Found the misogynist This is the most completely unrelated and unnecessary comment I’ve ever seen. Sounds nice, tbh. But also like the new feature in which you don’t even realize that strangers texted you I wish those guys used the ""let's not send unsolicited dick pics"" features in their brain... If available. I'll try that new Tele thing so their nudes & insults are archived, I just wish it didn't have to be me accommodating them. Where is this feature? Yep I do that every time! I disabled it, can you believe that doesn't reduce it to 0? It's so strange. Of course then it's just 1 or 2 but it's so bizarre. telegram has some good hitmen. I see. Thanks for clarifying. Actually thought that group admins can limit this somehow. I'm sorry, what? Because it's true ? Create a script to upload them somewhere (a public searchable database, ideally something that pops up on Google after typing their name) and then delete them from your Telegram, that will quickly stop them it’s based on TG’s servers, it’ll only show up if you receive a lot of messages from non contacts 

CC /u/CuriousLampoon Second this question. I don't have it either. Maybe you are a member of some groups where people peek through the members list and look for gals. Could you back up your claim with some facts? Why doesn't Telegram give privacy (if you use secure chat) Haha wicked! 😂👏 I just wish there was a way to send it to their parents or so That's fucked up mate.


Where can I find it? [deleted] I can access your account just having your number, I can steal your data and then delete your account, there's no privacy and/or security at all my friend, keep your chats in a better place (Signal) and do not save data in the cloud, or at least encrypt them, just an advice. Ah! And if you have a cloud password I can delete your account just with two taps. There are no limits to your creativity Android dev said so 

i guess that’s something you need to take up w telegram, via twitter or volunteer support Most people use a password in addition to the phonenumber so the first statement seems a little wrong or exaggerated.

Secure Chat is e2e so how that is so horribly worse than Signal feels a little ""politicised"" to me. 

Anyways, appreciate the reply. I use Signal daily but Telegram is to me a user experience lightyears ahead of Signal and that counts for something (just not security 😁)"

iOS - Show badge notifications for muted chats;2;hyuiuf;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hyuiuf/ios_show_badge_notifications_for_muted_chats/;17;[removed];2020-07-27 18:36:58;"I would say that is how its intended. If someone wants to get a hold of you in the group chat they will ""@nick"" and then you will get an notification.

Works the same way in Android. why don't you just set the notification tone and vibration to ""nothing"" in that chat's notification setting? It's not a group chat. It's just a regular chat. I want other chats to receive notifications, just not this one. But I still want a badge icon notification. You can't. You can only mute a chat, which means there are NO notifications at all. Can't find any badge-settings under custom notifications so I don't think its possible on Android either. [?](https://i.imgur.com/LTTcdlU.jpg) It looks like from my google searches that it USED to be possible, but not anymore. I don't know why. All that does is change the tone for that person. If I mute disable notifications there, I don't get any notifications at all - not even badge. It’s due to iOS 13 and its background usage for apps exactly. so the closest you can get to having no notifs w badges is to disable sound + vibration and whatnot, because who wants to disable notifications but also receive notifications at the same time? makes no sense A badge is not a notification in the traditional sense. It's not a message that pops up or a notification on your lock screen or status bar. This is not an unusual request and, in fact, used to be possible in Telegram. it is? the badge is used to notify you of a new message. if you don’t want to be notified of such, then you will turn off notifications. hence, you will not be notified of new messages via push notifications, via banners, via badges if you turn notifications off. Ok you're clearly just arguing to argue. to telegram devs, they cater to the main user base and not edge cases. so if users want to not receive notifications, the devs will make sure you aren’t notified. Well, again, they used to allow this so obviously it is something people wanted. afaik it was considered a bug and fixed AFAIK, it was a feature. https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1153342063804657665?s=21

once you find out who did so, remove them from your contacts and click the ""leave and report as spam"" button The same way you add a user as exception, you can select groups too The problem is I left the group for so many times but there's no button for report as spam (Using telegram for Android) and I can't see the floating message you mentioned Thanks that's what I needed. then borrow an iOS device to log into Telegram with or remove the contacts you don’t trust lol.

It might be that you started the deletion process but deleted the app too fast for it to finish. Did you have a stable connection while deleting? If the client can't update the server to delete those messages before you the delete the app then from the server's perspective you never deleted them. it’s the official telegram app and only minutes tbh. Well, this time around i did in inside the chat, then exited to the main menu, slid left on the chat, and hit delete there. it gave me the same question to see if i wanted to delete it on both ends, and i said yes. and when i deleted and downloaded it again, it was gone. even when i made a new chat. so maybe i finally did it? if i didn’t , oh well I think it's cause bigger chats can take a while to delete: they need to be wiped from your devices, your friend's devices, and the server. Maybe that's why it didn't stick the first time.

They don’t work for me - after enabling this on my and wife’s phones tried to make video call - connected, but see only own video - parter is still a static profile image (on both sides). Both in one WiFi. Only in the closed beta — this feature does not appear in the latest version of the iOS client. Been available since 6.2.5 Apparently yes. For now. I asked my mother to turn the experimental feature on her phone. And yes, we were able to make a video call. It seems like group video calls are not available yet. Both devices need to have the experimental feature on It does. I’ve already made three video calls after asking my friends to turn it on within the debug menu. They had to update the app today but none of them has ever downloaded the beta version. In beta. It became available on the latest (6.3) stable. I see, i couldn't enable on android. Thank you. Okay. I have the latest version on iOS and that option does not appear. Typically, debug options are for beta testers. Did you try touching the settings button 10x in a row to open the debug menu? If you already knew it, please ignore this message. Just trying to understand why you couldn’t find it. No, I did not know that — thanks! No one mentioned *how* to unlock it when I posted. 

I think I heard how when people started talking about being in the closed beta and how to access it, but since I wasn’t in the beta, it didn’t work, and I forgot. No problem. I’m glad you’ll be able to try it out now."

I remember WhatsApp limit being 65mb You can't share links from saved messages, but you may as well forward the message to the person Yes, now it's more than 16mb in whatsapp (still a joke). But they are referring to 2014. When it was 16mb. wait really? I thought there was an option to share the link to a file? You can share links to messages, but not to your saved messages.

which one? Even with this update, i don't have people nearby option in my note 4 with Android 9. I don't know why. I suggest tapping ❤ emoticon after sending it. :D Since telegram is free and no ads they sell. How do they manage to provide such huge storage facility for free?? I really wonder Was excited for a second. Still no video calls sad Anyone figure out how to set profile videos? I try to set a gif as one but it just saves as a still photo. I just want to be able to set a custom folder to appear when I open the app. Showing all messages defeats de whole purpose of folders Is this update available now? I just can't find it in Play Market Did you find where to set automatic archive option and group stat menu? Does this mean images and videos sent to people will be full quality? Repopulate the earth? Did anyone read that line on the feature update for nearby? Installed it, but the option wasn't there either. Got back to standard telegram. I cant figure out this Set as Main option on IOS. I cant see a set as main option on the profile pictures. Has anyone else figured this out? So they've mentioned that there's now a setting to auto-archive chats. Am I blind or is it hidden somewhere??? When videocall are coming? What about video call update ? Higher file limit is cool, but nothing interesting besides it. Profile videos, greeting stickers, score a goal? Recent updates are so minor. The last major was in October. Profile videos? I hope telegram won't become like crappy insta or whatsapp .What's the use of profile videos?🤔 The owner Pavel Durov [is worth 3.4 billion dollars](https://www.forbes.com/profile/pavel-durov/) I have the same question Man, they really dropped the biggest news of the update at the very end like that? The rest is nice but this is a game changer for many people. Nice dig on WhatsApp. I believe this is referring to the 💀. This one 🍑 If you go to Contacts section, what options you see? You can also try Telegram FOSS from F-Droid  
https://f-droid.org/packages/org.telegram.messenger

I use it and nearby people is available without having any g-apps.

You sometimes have to wait a few weeks before an update will be available due to telegram often not immediately releasing the source code. Video calls are there:

Also, their updates are still better than every competitor. So cool kids can show off. You won't even see it unless you go to somebody's profile. maybe, thx so much This is a good one, but I think they are talking about 💀 here since they specifically mention biting? this already existed in previous version Just invite friends and the list of contacts What is this version? Wow thanks! You can, just save it as mp4 and add it to your profile Oh, there it is in send files, ""send media as a file."" But I have Android not ios ☹️😃 I don't care about competitors, because I don't use them. ;)

Well I don't have lots of chats, so folders didn't rescue me. That's right :D Not animated, now it’s animated Did you revoke any permissions from Telegram app? It's the official Telegram App patched to run without G-Apps. I just checked. Everything is on. Tried to install but at the end it says app not installed , without any errors. (?) That's really strange. Do you have Google Apps installed? Did you download telegram or f-droid? You should install f-droid so you can also receive updates easier. There are a lot of nice open source apps on f-droid You mean any app from Google? I have many, yes. Edit, you mean the gapps package? I installed one, i think the one that brings the basic ones, micro or nano package from open gapps can't remember. Since Telegram uses gapps for some location-related things, I thing this might be the reason. I suggest contacting Telegram support: open Telegram -> go to Settings -> scroll down -> Ask a question"

Thank you. This very important information will save many. Nothing happened :( iOS.

Edit: toggled large emojis, works now. Thanks, I now fear the moment my mom tells me that our peach tree has fruit this year and then finally finds the emoji after sending off her message first... Nah man, to your crush. Risk it all When you tap on the sent animated sticker, you're basically slapping the boooteyh lol now try 🍆 lol 🍑 Well, it's not really an Easter Egg, just yet another animated emoji.

You can view a full list of them here: [https://t.me/AnimatedEmojis](https://t.me/AnimatedEmojis) That is some creativity lmao XD Thank you for telling me this, this knowledge will become useful in many ways in the future. omg 🙄 🍑 Are animated emojis really easter eggs? try the eggplant... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Bruh I did it in saved messages without reading your suggestion XD I'm using telegram x i can't find the emoji. Nice This isn’t an Easter egg. This is just how stickers work; each one is associated with an emoji. If you input that emoji a window is displayed that lets you choose one of the stickers associated with that emoji. No, they're not. 🧐 Sadly no >🍑

No need to, you can just copy and paste. Try to begin typing :peach They added it without any notice, and who sends a single peach 🍑 emoji to people? It's cleary meant as a surprise

Yes it's a feature of the app but it's not advertised anywhere by the team like the other animated emojis Nooo it is not a sticker... It is an animated emoji. You just send a single emoji and it transforms into that animation. If it were a sticker you put an emoji and choose a sticker among several I'm surprised at how disappointed that makes me. Animate the eggplant, make gross flirting modern! Check the eggplant now. Seems to have been updated."

Like Facebook group, User request to join and can able to post or see the content after admin approval.;2020-07-24 16:46:21;"- to ban/kick someone, you just delete a user in the list. They automatically get added to the ""removed users"" list whereby they can never rejoin (unless you go into that list and remove them from the ""removed users list"" which sounds meta and probably complicated but it's really easy)

- There is no option or setting in telegram to check whether a user is active, certainly not anything regarding _how_ active they are in your group. There are probably some bots that can monitor that but I can't help you there.

- You might just want a _private group_ with a **shareable** invitation link.

- you can change default **permissions** for new users so that as they join, they cannot do anything but read the chat. There's a huge level of granularity so check out your _group info > permissions_ for yourself. You can use @Combot Use replica@bot , it's new but a better system. Just type in what you want to happen, and it will translate into code and do it. Like literally cut and paste your post, and then you are finished. >user  . .    .. Nunn.. ...brb.  .   .

There was a direct chat you could start and report bugs or ask for features. They were way more responsive then they are now. I'd still like a solution for sending .webp files so they don't automatically appear as stickers. this is spot on 🤣 M U C H O T E X T O Shit. Guilty as charged. STONKS lol They fixed it in beta for big .webp files tbh, twitter would generally not show your tweets to your followers if you are mentioning an account (at the very start) if they don't follow the same account. 

if they were doing it, our timelines would be full of public chats that we are not part of. > tbh, twitter would generally not show your tweets to your followers if you are mentioning an account (at the very start) if they don't follow the same account.

This has definitely not been my experience. Unless.. are you saying that if you put the @ at the very beginning rather than the middle or end of your tweet, it hides it from your followers' timelines?? yes. if you start a tweet with a mention, that tweet would only be visible to those followers of yours who also follow that account. twitter would have been very painful to use if this was not the case because every public conversation of yours would be pushed to your followers and no one wants that! 

here is the [twitter support document](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/mentions-and-replies#u01__search--overlay:~\:text=When%20two%20people%20are%20replying%20to%20one%20another
). argh. reddit does not like ~ in urls. so it is not highlighting the relevant bit in the link. 

if you mention another user in between or at last (and not at the start), it becomes a regular tweet because you are not directly addressing anyone. it would be visible in timelines of all your followers. 

this is why you might have noticed that sometimes people start their tweet with a dot and then mention an account. they do this to broadcast that message to all their followers. [sample tweet](https://twitter.com/chartdatc/status/1286461298717458432) Does it specifically mention this on that article? can you just quote it or screenshot the paragraph about this feature, since I read down through it and couldn't find https://i.imgur.com/75FPvAb.jpg no I meant about starting the tweet with an @ starting a tweet with @ is basically how you replied before twitter changed the user interface where they show replying to above the tweet instead of as part of the message. i imagine third party apps not updated to adopt this ui would still show replies in old fashioned manner. 

if you have access to two accounts, you can basically test this on your own."

They just need to integrate file versioning: git for telegram xD If only I had a way of organizing the files.... Going back to find stuff from a while back can be a pain  


But seriously, top notch otherwise. I had such high hopes for MEGA when it came out.,.. how much GB max per file? There is a Telegram-Cloud btw : https://ogramcloud.com !
You can save a file on telegram-servers and share the download link ! Make private channel 😀 Love Telegram Cloud !! The best cloud ever The only problem is when one day your saved messages are gone. Happened to me, and there's 0 support on telegram Sooo true. Man this is one the best telegram features absolutely Telegram  is cool true my favorte backup method for the last 6 months XD Can't beat self-hosted Nextcloud instance though. wait. whats up with Mega? Arent they an encrypted cloud storage provider? wait. Those sub folder are arleady on the app or gonna be added? I was just thinking about this Or just use private channels. Bonus, you can share stuff with your SO/friends. I wish I use hashtags and created a message with a list of the hashtags I have used. Then I pinned that message so it is always clickable. Of course it can be edited. What's wrong with mega ? I still use it 2 GB I think it's 1.5 GB per file, but m not a 100% sure. Or use link to file bot, it has too much ads, but no file size limit If this shit takes off telegram will need to limit their api.

Use a file sharing website for that stuff. Would that allow me to upload files > 2 GB? Really? How long ago was this? Want them to be added. Can organize between notes, files and other shit Big brain Until then, gofile.io will be my solution for larger files. They increased it to 2GB a couple of days ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hm9b4f/telegram\_file\_limit\_size/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hm9b4f/telegram_file_limit_size/) Is it safe to use? I am slightly hesitant to give acess to my google drive to a bot made by some random person on th internet. Also, what is the advantage of using it over downloading directly from telegram app? No, 2gb per file Few months back You can just create a bunch of private channels, call them music, videos, notes etc, then just add links to those channels to your saved messages. 

Then it's going to be your «start page», and you can go to any specific channel from there. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

I guess it showed up in the public search or something, maybe. Now I create groups for this purpose. I add my second account (or my sibling's) to the group while creating it because there must be two people at least, and then remove the second account. Well, saved messages are kinda private right. Channels mean everybody can access them with just a link good bot My question is about the bots that add files to google drive. For example, Gdriveit_bot. Tags are really underrated. It was your 16 views. Your own views count too.

Anyway, groups work too. But you don't give links to anyone. Do you think anyone can just guess a link to your private channel? Thank you, tungcua, for voting on LinkifyBot.

Telegram official website: "" After a short while (around 4 days), Telegram will forget that you've seen a post and will count you again if you navigate to it. For this reason you may see several views for posts in a private channel where you are alone. "" well i do the same i have channels for my personal photos , notes and one for just random other imp stuff Public domain, private domain is different. Channels are public, saved messages are not.

It's  just a matter of choice. I'm not comfortable with it maybe, that's why. Channels aren't necessary public, you can set a channel to be private and just not invite anyone or share the link. People won't even know it exists. [deleted] Private channels are only public channels with a more complex URL. For real?? Telegram can delete your personal stuffs on ""Saved Messages"" without your permission? Good luck bruteforcing ONE url.

Oh yea, never click those links on any circumstance.


I would recommend to not interact at all. Just report, block, and move on. If you see him, you're playing his game.

If you really want, you can ask for help on Telegram voluntary support, it's on the apps menus.

Have you put your phone number on shady/less secure websites/services on the past year? That might be the cause.

The one you linked to seems more feature rich, but as a desktop user it feels bizarre, like someone ported a phone app to desktop. Glad you sorted it! I've honestly never noticed it until you just mentioned. I auto hide the menu bar. 

Just had a look and you can do it from Settings - General - Interface and turn the radio button off for ""Show Icon In Menubar"" 👍 I've just tried the other one out of curiosity as I've only ever used the MacOS one. I guess one is coded for multi-platform ports and one is designed for especially for MacOS. 

The MacOS one (6.2.3 (202354) Stable) does seem a lot more feature rich as you say and much quicker. The sticker animations are smoother etc and UI is nicer.

I prefer it a lot to be honest and will continue to use it other the multi-plat one, but each to their own I guess! Ah great cheers, sorted now :)"

> is forbidden to interfere with the basic functionality of Telegram. This includes but is not limited to: making actions on behalf of the user without the user's knowledge and consent, preventing self-destructing content from disappearing, **preventing last seen and online statuses from being displayed correctly**, tampering with the 'read' statuses of messages (e.g. implementing a 'ghost mode'), preventing typing statuses from being sent/displayed, etc. I think it is possible through the reply window in the notification shade in Android (I have done it) I dont want to hide it. I dont want it to update Well the client may act according to the TOS. Me - the user would misuse the client. Yeah something like that. I also tried the reply window, but gets really uncomfortable You'd need to compile the client yourself with modifications then, unless you are writing your own. If you find a client readily available with this as a feature then it is by definition in violation of the TOS, and if there are safeguards to detect tampering with online status server-side then you risk running into problems. The client would send that I am online. It can't because there is no connection. Now does it report that I was online when the phone reconnects? Thats like a normal use case, I think. Do you mean say, disconnect from the network and open the client to see messages that arrived in the background, send a reply, hide the client and reconnect? That might work, I'm not sure.

You risk the server detecting activity like sending messages without updating the online status, and it may in fact update your online status to be the last time you sent a message regardless of whether or not the client reported that you were online. I have not tested this. Yes. I meant that. Okay thank you for the response :) Would be actually clever for the server to act like that but don't know if this would cause too much load when checking it for every message... Yeah it's something to be aware of - maybe try test it with a friend."

Transform your telegram account to a Cloud-Storage-Api.;10;htte5m;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/htte5m/transform_your_telegram_account_to_a/;18;"Hey there, i made a tricky hack on Telegram to transform your telegram account to a storage-api system !

Demo : [https://youtu.be/YcKQRshOhto](https://youtu.be/YcKQRshOhto)

Source-Code : [https://github.com/sanix-darker/ogramcloud](https://github.com/sanix-darker/ogramcloud)

Beta-version (Max-file-upload: 100MB)

Have FUN, give me feedbacks !";2020-07-19 05:52:38;"I mean it's cool, but it abuses the freedom the Telegram API gives you. You betray Telegram's trust and they'll could limit their API, which is not in anyone's favour. 

These are things got have to think about. Let the API limiting begin *sigh* Hate this idea, it’s redundant and abuses telegram rules It is a messaging app, not cloud storage, why you want to misuse the app? isn't it faster to use ""Saved Messages"" ?

*and the limit is not 15/16Mb but 1500Mb (1.5Gb)* Beau boulot, félicitations. Tu viens du Québec ? My thoughts exactly. That's why we can't have nice things.

Like in China, Amazon blocked 14 day return policy on a lot of items because there are huge number of people who would just lease expensive items like a 1080ti for 14 days for free, then return it. 

This is just ruining it for everyone. It's just a Proof-Of-Concept(Not an official-product), i was wondering if it can be done !  
But you're right.. in on another way to see it... I will upgrade that on a none beta version ! Practically, it is. You can send messages to yourself and so can you send files (just take a look at ""Saved Messages""). Therefore, there's no need to use such a bot in my opinion. With the latest beta, you can upload up to 2000 MB per file. Merci beaucoup ! Non non, d'Afrique de l'ouest, pourquoi ? OgramCould allows you to automate this process without having it done!

UI is for API testing, that's it!

To save a file, usually it is manually, with ogramCloud, this operation can be subtracted by another third party app!

With OgramCloud, you don't need to have a telegram account to save files if you have someone's chat-id!

Suppose also that, you don't have a telegram account, but you want to send me a file, I give you my cat-id, you will send it to me on OgramCloud then give me the file-key that will allow me to restore the file as many times as possible!

So many possibilities ... so thats better C'est juste accent qui apparaît comme celle de Québec Ah d'accord ok ok !"

That would be my first shot if you talk about that YOUR chat has disappeared He could have opened up a new chat with the account if he knew the username or phone number and then cleared the past history. He could have deleted the chat for you both on his end. Nope, I really dont think he could have guessed it. If that's the case, I'm fucked... im hoping the chat was archived but I remember it being deleted... :S Okay sure. Is that desktop? You could also look in settings->privacy and security ->active sessions . Maybe you will find a trace that somebody logged in from a suspicious place that is not yours, or even cleaned some other sessions which should be there. Just a blind guess :/ It could be on any client. If the old phone number was still saved in his contacts, it would show up in his contact list on telegram and he could start a conversation from there. Or if there was a username, he could search by username and it would show up. Then he could clear the history the same way he did with the other chat. I will do, it's on my laptop so the format is a bit weird. Only my current session is there. So I'm not sure. Thank you anyway :) Thank you so much, yeah looks like past conversations were cleared as he still had my number. Sorted, cheers :) Hope it will clearify somehow. Maybe change passwords on services/websites that are similar...just in case .. wish you the best

I am creating a new theme but I can't find the variable name for the blue play/pause button for voice messages. I haven't found it online either.

Does someone know (if it even is possible)? I would be thankful. Appreciate your time, cheers! **On Android:**

Blue circles: `chat_inLoader` and `chat_outLoader`  
Icons in center: `chat_inMediaIcon` and `chat_outMediaIcon`

*Note that if you have a gradient set for the out bubbles, then you can't change the `chat_outMediaIcon` color. It will be the same color as the out bubbles.

**On TDesktop:**

Blue circles: `msgFileInBg` and `msgFileOutBg`  
Icons in center: `historyFileInIconFg` and `historyFileOutIconFg`

Join us in the telegram theme groups if you need more help with variables. There are plenty of knowledgeable people who are happy to help: AndroidThemesGroup and TelegramThemes Under the accent tab, there's a media section. The variable you're looking for is called ""file"" Sweet! That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much! 

I would have guessed that the variable is called the same in the desktop client. Nice to know that there are different naming conventions, thanks for the heads up. 

Now I know where to look for help. Cheers! [deleted] I'm not entirely sure what you mean.

The screenshot above is from Telegram's Android Version. I exported the theme and looked into the file but wasn't able to find it.

On the Linux Desktop client there is a bit more information but I am too not able to find it.

Can you please elaborate? Set the variable `chat_outBubbleGradient` :) Oh, I'm sorry. I use Telegram X. We have the option to change the color in Telegram X. Telegram has less theming options than Telegram X."

So it was your handle in that clickable underlined text. No, no one has access to your saved messages. (Apart from possibly Telegram itself, which claims not to look at them.) That was most probably just a link. Appart from the privacy concerns, there is also another issue, which i discovered here in reddit some months ago. Some user experimented a delete of it's messages older than a certain date, including it's saved messages. Probably some internal error in the servers, but it happened. Don't rely in this system as an eternal, perfect and always reliable system. Save some notes, some to-dos... just use it the same way you should use google keep No way its safe. You are storing your data not on some one else's server. [deleted] if police request the data, telegram will hand over. Are you saying the text is a embedded hyperlink to my telegram username? If so, how did they do that? Also, thanks for your response as it made sense and relieved my paranoia hahahah This is the most probable situation This is the right answer here. Needs more upvotes. thank you for your response, however, im curious as to what link would direct it to your own saved messages + it was a normal text that is underlined and clickable. Yeah, i was just being paranoid haha, thanks! I figured it was a spam group and left :/ Source of precedent please. In telegram x and many other clients you can long click instead of a single click when tagging someone in a group and create hyperlink to their profile. Fascinating. URLs starting with tg:// are able to do things like prepare a message to send to someone (they don't actually send it though). That's probably what this was using. It depends. If you are paranoid you can always [upload encrypted files](https://i.imgur.com/h5Wuq3J.png). OpenPGP is a good protocol, easy to encrypt and decrypt. to be clear, in those clients, it's possible for me to just send ""hello"" and tag someone with that text being clickable and a hyperlink to their account, is that right? i see, is there any need for me to worry about my privacy tho? the link that he sent was just like a normal text like ""hello, how are you?"" without any URLs, it then divert to my saved messages. I know the chances of my privacy being violated is slim but even if there's a slight chance, im gonna be paranoid hahaha You have a great body. yup That link used telegram markdown. You can hold on a text to select it and then press the three dot menu. Here you can style your text or press create link, to make your text like [this](http://reddit.com).

And about going to saved messages, maybe that was some tg:// link, I'm not sure. But anyway that doesn't mean your saved messages aren't safe. They are as safe as any other chat you have. (Beside secret chats which use E2E encryption.) No, he won't even know if you clicked on the link. LOL. Good one. Now I know you could not have decrypted it. It's actually a cat picture. you lot are the best. Thank you all! Case closed :-) I think it's not possible for IOS devices as I've tried. But i did came to the conclusion that the person did hyperlink his text to my telegram account which leads me to my own saved messages :) Thank u tho! ""If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold that against me?"" Why it is impossible for you to be a cat? ;)

Who said only people use internet? iOS has formatting included in the UI instead of using Markdown. Just select the text you want to format, then tap the **B***I*U̲ option. From there you can also add links."

No, not this case In the device section you can see some info about the device (IP, OS, position).

If you log it out and it turns out it is actually a device of yours, you can always login again from that device.

If anyone has access to your Telegram account, I don't think they can have access to all your activities, unless you have some messages that compromises them and they read it. Take a screenshot of the information, then log it out. With the screenshot you can track it all the same as with it logged into your account, but without the risk of it reading your messages or impersonating you."

Recuring issues regarding unshared invite links for group being obtained by unwanted parties.;14;hr688z;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hr688z/recuring_issues_regarding_unshared_invite_links/;14;"I run a small, yet tight private group, and have done so for a couple of years now, but for the year, give or take some months, we've been having a massive issue regarding unwanted or uninvited people joining through invite links that have never been shared.

The moderation team is small and trusted, and we have done tests regularly revoking the invite link, and yet we still have issues with people joining. The people doing so have either been people who saw the link shared in another group, or accounts that begun to spam, then deleted themselves from Telegram alltogether, with similar harassment having been directed at one admit and several users in the group.

But the main issue is the unwanted joining. Back when revoking an invite link meant a group physically didn't have any until a new one was created, this was not a problem for obvious reasons.

But the thing i write here for is to know if this is an issue anyone else has encountered before, and if there are any ways to help this, at all. I've contacted the Telegram moderation about it, and recieved no help.";2020-07-14 20:50:36;"1. Do you have any moderator bots? Bots can make links automatically.
2. Moderators could be sharing them without telling you.
3. You can withdraw the right from Everyone to create links, and distribute only one that you made.
4. Even if a bot is not moderator, if you share a link in the group, a bot can take the link and share it with its creator and anyone the creator shares it with (basically bots make your chat public if the makers are not trustworthy)
5. People invited can share the link with others. Ask each one of moderators to revoke the group link from their end, it has happened to one of the group I was in before, admins weren't able to figure out how people are still being able to get into the group even after revoking the link and had to make a new group all together. Later it turned out that all they had to do was to make every admin revoke their link from their end. >Back when revoking an invite link meant a group physically didn't have any until a new one was created, this was not a problem for obvious reasons.

Wait how does it work now? If you revoke the link how are people getting in? Sorry if you’re aware of this already, but echoing what another person has commented, the invite links generated are unique to the admin generating it. So if you, Person A, revokes the link after Person B has generated it, the new link generated is only scrambled relative to the last link you, Person A, has shared. Person B has to revoke the link for it to truly be disabled. 

That being said, you’re saying that every single one of your admins has gone to the invite page and revoked the link in their unique account? Because in the absence of bots, people continuing to join just doesn’t make any sense. 

Another alternative to you being the only person able to generate invite links, would be for y’all to add people to the group via their username (@) only, bypassing the need for links entirely. 1. Nope.

2. I trust the moderators, and they're all just as annoyed at this as i am, and they're good people.

3. That is what we're trying now, yeah, and we will see if this repeats.

4. We don't share the link in the group, so that's not an issue, neither do we have a bot in the group.

5. We revoke the invite link immediately after anyone join, though this whole issue tends to happen even in periods where no one have joined for a while. We've already done that every single time it has happened thus far, to sadly no effect. Now, when you revoke an invite link, another one is immediately created.

Back about a year and a half or so ago when you revoked the link, the group didn't have any anymore, and you would manually create a link when the need was there.

We have a theory that either:

* A. Some old invite link somehow works for some reason.

* B. There's a way to brute force the invite link from a group. > Another alternative to you being the only person able to generate invite links, would be for y’all to add people to the group via their username (@) only, bypassing the need for links entirely.

De default to doing this, but use invite links sparingly. But as mentioned before we now will try having only me have the ability to add people, and see if that fixes anything One strategy is to not have a link that anyone knows except the creator until someone new is invited, then it's revoked immediately. One of your moderators may not be doing it properly, or lying. The invite links have so many possible combinations that it's not practical to brute force. That's the current thing we're trying yea. I've in the past heard of ways to automatically brute force an invite link from a group, aka somehow get the group to tell you.

Someone a year or so back once mentioned having heard of such a thing, so we've theorized it to be that.

We did actually once all 3 (we're that few, only 4 now) revoke the link, and within a day someone had joined through a link again. And then it was confirmed and proven that all links were revoked the day before, and no new ones given out. That's the strange part of it. You can check which moderators invite link they used by exporting the chat data. It will say:

>""@username .. joined group by link from moderator\_name"""

""I'm about to get laggy"" If only my group of friend uses telegram i would never use whats app ever again Lol the quantity and quality comes no where close to Telegrams sticker library. Fuck WhatsApp, all my homies hate WhatsApp WhatsApp will go down sometime I always wondered why this took so long (even in Telegram). Animated Emojis were already around in Trillian, back when AIM and ICQ were still a thing. WeChat users: did i time leap to 2010? It's like ios adding widgets . Where Android users be like Still no WebM support, all WebP files are still sent as stickers, still no group calls. Sometimes I wish Telegram devs wouldn't get so comfortable just because WA sucks. Telegram isn’t the first to add animated stickers, viber did it before. Really? They cause lag? My friend group does but not everyone else I communicate with gotta convince em to switch, like sending song files or non-compressed videos to em Well, the reason it took a while on Telegram is that their stickers are kind of different than most expected. They're something like 60 fps and super tiny, which is why they load fast. Might even be smaller in size than the animated emoji. Now, why those took a while, I have no idea, they seem pretty regular. Group video calls are coming. Stickers are actually stored and sent as webp, so it renders webp files as stickers. Same thing happens when sending .tgs files. And let's talk about their desktop app for a moment should we ? They might on whatsapp [deleted] I know that. It's very inconvenient considering how common the WebP format is on the web now. There should've been another way to detect stickers, probably filenames. Sending saved images from websites like Reddit to friends is a hassle. I actually take commissions for animated stickers on telegram (they don't look nearly as good as Telegram's ""official"" ones (if you see an animated furry pack, I probably did it)). They're done using a vector format, so they can be scaled up or down to any size without quality loss. They have a strict 64kb limit on all animated stickers.

If you're curious, they use a slightly edited version of the Lottie format.

Edit: (Ps. That's prolly a *feature* that almost everyone hates haha) Sounds strange.

One possibility is that you have saved an old phone number of them which is now owned by someone else who joined Telegram.

I think you should be able to see their number on their profile if you got the notification

But I don't really see a reason to lie about using Telegram but who knows Seems extremely unlikely to me. I know many glitches that have happened in the past, but this is not one of them or anything near it.

While it could potentially be a glitch, it's probably your SO either joining and forgetting or straight-up lying about it. a new account with his phone number is created for sure, it's not a bug or anything.

But maybe you have an old number of him saved in your phone contacts which someone else has it now, and they created an account so it caused the notification you got. Sounds like you have more serious issues to work on than just an app.

The language you use ('confronted') shows you are hostile to him using it from the beginning, perhaps think why what would be, and why would he not tell you he is using it?

If you have to snoop around getting his phone without him knowing so you can check for yourself, you've lost the game, think whether you want to be in that kind of relationship where you have to do something like that.

On the technical side of things, yes it can be a glitch. I get similar things sometimes, where I see a notification about someone joining Telegram, but I have no idea who they are, never heard of their name and they are not in my contacts. Telegram does have such bugs, so this may well be such a case. You have to sign up you know, you can't just type in your phone number and start using it, a confirmation message comes to your phone, and I think you have to write your name too idk. What you can do is, ask for his phone, check his SMS messages for the confirmation message. You can be even creepier by asking for his phone and somehow logging in with one of your devices with the confirmation message coming to his telegram. So whenever you are not with him, you can actually see if he has someone who he is talking to. Yet if you are willing to go this far, why bother calling him your SO. The person is lying Significant Other. Thank you! Sorry for asking this here. I just checked and the account was using his current phone number.

He maybe denying it cos it will be a fight or he’s probably cheating. Idk. Thank you! Since we’ve broken up and he’s been okay and almost not affected by the break up, I’m now assuming he really joined Telegram and is now using it to talk to some other women. Haha I just checked the account and it was using his current number. It’s probably him and downplaying it. Yeah, I'm curious about this point, also. Why would you ""confront"" anyone about using a messaging app? While it is weird that he would lie about it, it doesn't make it any less weird for someone to automatically assume some wrongdoing because of its usage. Ooof, sounds pretty insignificant to me. Well confront might have been a strong word. I asked him, he denied, and I’m not the type to snoop on his phone. Yep. Thank you for this. We’ve just broken up so now I don’t have to this about this anymore.  I thought it meant superior officer Well you’re not wrong 😂"

If you both do this you should have each other in your contacts with your numbers.

Alternatively, you can create a private group channel, make an invite link, share it to the other person through some other means (I presume you're already in contact, judging by the scenario you described) and, once they join the group, add them to contacts. That works, thanks! Private group or private channel or does it not really matter?

People Nearby is a cool solution, but with a range of 10 miles (I assume, judging by others I can see) it is not really private. Ideal would be limited to a range of 10 feet (average GPS accuracy). I think either is fine. You can either see them as a member of a group or a follower of your channel. As for the range on People Nearby, it shouldn't matter too much if you turn it on, add each other, and instantly turn it off."

Ty!";2020-07-12 16:42:56;"[deleted] The *user* you mentioned, is he coming back with new accounts or what? [deleted] Id suggest finding a hood userbot, these can auto ban accounts when specific phrases are said. Wait, you can keep creating new accounts with the same phone number? I should think there is some limit on how many times you can do this over a period of time. Check out Chainfuel.com, we have got a few tricks up our sleeve to prevent spamming So ban has no reason to exist. Sadly not a possible option.

Telegram's had this bug ever since you stopped being able to manually create invite links which allows people to join through old ones. Or there's some method to figure out the link for the current group, idk, but a group i run has had an issue issue with such for 6+ months. Yes. Its a way to bypass the bans from groups.
@user disable his account and enable with another user using the same phone.

Something like this
https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@acryptokid/how-to-rejoin-a-telegram-group-when-you-are-banned I'll give it a try, ty! Well, you have to disable before. When this happens all bans are revoked. Then u can enter again in the groups you were banned before.
It's a sploit.
Really don't know if exist a limit for this, I hope so. Not everyone is willing to delete their account and create a new one just to join a group where he/she was banned, so bans are not useless.
However you should revoke the link to stop spammers from joining if they already got the link. Did this solve your problem? they should get a flood restriction soon, Telegram doesn't like when you keep creating new accounts front the same IP Oh well then there really is no way to stop this except, making your group private or revoking the join the link. Sorry if i sounded rude, many users are creating account just to Join group, so this don't help.
This cant solve my problem, Its a group to help users about Android tv. 
Sure i can change the link adress, but every other places i posted before will lose it too. :/ Thats good news! Ty Very much Sadly, I think this is the only way.
Ty! Just my two cents: generally, posting group links to general group lists will be a great way to attract spammers. Post the link again everywhere then?

Does the user have any identifying characteristics? A name, a photo, etc. If we can identify a pattern programmatically (through a bot), we can enforce the ban with code. Additional measures are: more moderators, blacklisting certain vocabulary (stuff the user would say), etc. No that's alright! :D
When a supergroup gets populated and the link is on other places, it becomes hard to control and attracts few spammers. To solve this you can use bots or create a bot with your own rules. Just posted in some forum related, like xda.
No spam in other groups. But appreciate this tip! Nothing for real, it's strange that telegram do not records some info for this. So even if a new account from the same number it's created it will still banned.
All these kind of tools are already in use to help.
Just curious how it works and in supergroups for an example.

To hard to control this situations.
Appreciate your help! The thing is, we are a small group, around 250 members. Just thinking about the future if this happens with other users.
I'm actually using rose as a admin robot. It helps for sure, I think this is a situational issue (I hope)

How can telegram claim to be anti-censorship when they clearly ban groups on demand?;1;hpten4;Telegram;https://journalismisnotacrime.com/en/features/903/;5;;2020-07-12 15:09:01;"Also. DMCA isn’t censorship either, same goes for general abuse, impersonating, and posting content that doesn’t comply with their TOS (if you signup you agree the TOS, and if something isn’t allowed, it’s not censorship, it’s just respecting rules you subscribed). Blocking terrorists and calls to violence is not a censorship would you be fine if BLM is declared a terrorist group and any mention of it is scrubbed from the internet? Yes. Because this is what it is: leftist movement aimed at destabilizing an already not very stable situation.

What happened baby, your extremist channel was reported and banned so you came to cry here? LOL.

look at the way apple users download, before Telegram, stuff like Maps, Gmail and Youtube. In my country, a girl do a post on Facebook with the  ""best Telegram's things"". It was incredible see people sign up, who I try before to use it, just for that post. There are other mods like telegram x, which aren't probably counted here. Not sure though. Telegram was [\#18 in 2019 Q4 list](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sensortower-itunes/blog/2020/01/2019-report-screenshot.jpg), [\#20 in Q3 2019](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sensortower-itunes/blog/2019/10/q3-2019-worldwide-top-apps.jpg) and it was completely absent from such lists before. So it is rising sharply, more than I expected. This news is actually more important than Telegram having #1 spot in any given country. Every other app on the lists are blocked on my home network. I feel very lucky at the moment Update July: top 10 overall!

Edit: wow people take a joke I swear Facebook sells data like there’s no tomorrow How is it more secure than Messenger or Whatsapp? It doesn’t even have secure messaging by default. telegram willingly collaborates with governments.  recent unlocking it in Russia testifies to this Whats telegram x? Thank you for this information! I always wanted to know more precisely how Telegram is gaining popularity. Here in Brazil virtually all people (and now businesses too) use Whatsapp but I'm seeing more and more people giving Telegram a try. I hope it is a global trend. it isn’t owned by a company that willingly cooperates with governments and participate in campaigns to promote genocide Messenger clients are closed-sourced so you don’t really know what it’s doing.
In Telegram at least you know the client is doing nothing suspicious when you enable the E2EE encryption Probably because WhatsApp doesnt mention 'encryption' anywhere in its app description in the play store.

Telegram does. E2EE chats are not the default because you cannot view them on more than one device while you can view all other chats on all your devices An alternative, yet official client on Android. It also existed on iOS a while ago, where it even replaced the original Telegram app because it was more modern (written in Swift I believe). My smarter twin. Wow, way to throw down the ideological gauntlet, PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES. But doesn't Signal allow this while still being e2ee? How do they do it What are you talking about? It's the truth. It makes a gigantic difference which company you pick for your chat and email. If you want to go with fucking Google, you deserve what you get. :) i mean, sure? it’s a well known fact that while Telegram has a problem with ISIS and alt-right groups, they’re slowly but surely being pushed out and banned from the platform. 

meanwhile facebook actively allowed and promoted false information and news in Myanmar (the population’s main news source), fueling the genocide of the Rohingya and causing them to flee to neighboring countries. i don’t even think they attempted to take such things down. and i’m pretty sure they were sued for not taking any action to stop the spread of the articles that killed others. 

all the while, they’re sucking every megabyte of personal info they can from people evil Zuckerberg is currently attempting to force the natives of Hawaii to sell the surrounding land to Zucc so he can have a private beach. the dude is plain evil, would you trust him and his company to respect your privacy when push comes to shove? compared to Telegram, who’s went up to bat the few times the govt tried to force telegram to hand over information? lmao, I was just commenting on the strange juxtaposition of the seriousness of his comment with the ridiculousness of his username. I don't understand all the downvotes. Where did I say it wasn't the truth? Wish people wouldn't assume things."

Do you know if group chats are encrypted on Telegram? Stupid bot. [Apparently](https://www.wired.com/story/neo-nazis-are-running-out-of-places-to-hide-online/) they're being booted off telegram. I think yes. They are encrypted in transit, nobody but Telegram can access their content (and the group members from their devices of course) I think they are. But it crazy that they have an organised structure and disinformation tactics I'm not actually surprised. I'm a bit disappointed that it took the telegram team this long to lose the nazis, but white supremacy and nazism aren't ideologies that form in a vacuum. For better or worse, they're people like the rest of us and people need community. > For better or worse, they're people like the rest of us and people need community.

I have no sympathy for hate groups, but otherwise you're not wrong... I'm fine with hate groups having a public forum as long as that forum can be monitored by law enforcement. A better example is child molesters... you don't want to shut a forum where they discuss their crimes down. It won't stop them from harming kids, it'll just drive them underground. Rather, you want to infiltrate the forum and catch them all, so they can get help. And of course by help I mean a .45 between the eyes fired by a 1911... Exactly. But I think it must be regulated somehow Oh no, it wasn't intended as sympathy. Understanding that they're not a different species from the rest of us is an important reminder that no-one is infallible and extremism can happen to or from basically anyone. Alt-right folks can reform, moderate or liberal folks can become extreme. 

Also: it was meant more of an explanation why I'm not surprised that they have methods of communicating with others. I'm not saying nazi social groups deserve to exist, but I understand why they do. 

And yea, I'm definitely proud that Telegram ruined their day. There's a recent article (that I linked) that mentions that forcing them to take a spread out approach to communication makes it easier to infiltrate and prevent action."

**Do you know how to fix it?** If you're banned, this method doesn't work. It only works in some circumstances. The API hash is a string - have you surrounded it with either single or double quotes? Like:

`API_HASH = 'api-hash-here'`

or

`API_HASH = ""api-hash-here""`

The API ID is an integer, don't surround it in quotes. That's why I was asking. You said that if you're banned and you're in the list of removed. Isn't that list the banned list? I manually have to remove a person from the banned list to have them rejoin. Sorry, I see the confusion now - I just realised that I made an error in the post. It should instead read:

On my phone (running AOSP 10.0), Keybase has a white preview, even with the system dark theme turned on.

Apps do this by setting a window manager flag - `LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE` \- which is checked every time a window's contents is displayed in various scenarios. If it's turned on, it will show as a blank white image in the overview/quickstep/recent apps screens.

"Telegram is opaque about metadata they collect. Shall they be more transparent since they claim to be ""private""?";90;hom9vp;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hom9vp/telegram_is_opaque_about_metadata_they_collect/;21;"I would like to understand how much metadata Telegram collects.

Their privacy policy only mentioned 4 lines on the topics:

\>  ""we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc. If collected, this  metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.""

And:

\> ""We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see \[section 5.5\]([https://telegram.org/privacy#5-5-advanced-features](https://telegram.org/privacy#5-5-advanced-features)) below) that work across all your devices.""

[https://telegram.org/privacy](https://telegram.org/privacy)

Other messaging apps are a lot more explicit about metadata collection. WhatsApp and other messaging applications explain clearly what they collect.

* What data does Telegram collect about our locations?
* What data does Telegram collect about our devices?
* What's being the ""etc"" Telegram use in their privacy policy?
* What is the ""aggregated metadata"" Telegram create and store?
* What metadata does Telegram store?

Telegram claims to be ""private and secure"" but they are opaque about metadata collection.

I believe Telegram should be more transparent about what metadata they collect. Metadata can say a lot about private conversation.

This is an example by EFF of what metadata can say even when a conversation is end-to-end encrypted (conversations are not even E2EE by default on Telegram):

>\> They know you rang a phone sex service at 2:24 am and spoke for 18 minutes. But they don't know what you talked about.  
>  
>\> They know you called the suicide prevention hotline from the Golden Gate Bridge. But the topic of the call remains a secret.  
>  
>\> They know you spoke with an HIV testing service, then your doctor,  then your health insurance company in the same hour. But they don't know  what was discussed.  
>  
>\> They know you received a call from the local NRA office while it was  having a campaign against gun legislation, and then called your  senators and congressional representatives immediately after. But the  content of those calls remains safe from government intrusion.  
>  
>\> They know you called a gynecologist, spoke for a half hour, and then  called the local Planned Parenthood's number later that day. But nobody  knows what you spoke about.

This is not a comparison to Signal on metadata collection but Signal is a lot more transparent on metadata they collect. In fact, the founder of Signal published his metadata that was created/collected by Signal app: [https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-as-the-world-moves-forward/](https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-as-the-world-moves-forward/)";2020-07-10 13:01:04;"Telegram should be more transparent, implement a transparency relationship such as [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/blog/transparency-report/) and many other services and should revive the privacy policy by including the metadata collected in chats and secret chats. There are bigger issues like:

* If you nuke your account is the data really deleted?
* How many data requests and made by whom?

Always remember that your ""cloud chats"" are stored in the cloud UNENCRYPTED.

You must **trust** that Telegram motivation and claims are true for holding your data private, and also **trust** telegram to hold that data without mining it you lend it to 3rd parties.

EDIT: at least i trust on Telegram a little more than Messenger/Whatsapp/Instagram but that's it. trust [deleted] A bit of clearing up on meta data collection and open sourcing their server side code is pretty much all that Telegram needs to become the perfect private messenger. I wish they were also a bit more upfront about the data that gets shared with bots as well. Only telegram app platform is open source behind that everything else is a black box. Concerned about privacy? Telegram does not guarantee it. It's worth noting that after the collapse of the TON blockchain project, the funding of which helped cover some of Telegram's costs, which Pavel Durov was paying for out of pocket. I think he will have to start thinking about monetizing Telegram somehow. Meanwhile, after the Russian government unblocked Telegram, company execs have started talking to the Russian government and asking them to rein in Apple and Google. 

I don't intend this to spark concerns about ""Russian hackers"" or whatever, but it's a huge turnaround given how confrontational Durov has always been with them in the past. You don't have to love Apple and Google to be concerned that Durov finds them a bigger problem than a government. \>  This is an example by EFF of what metadata can say 

All these examples are irrelevant to Telegram, since you cannot call public services via messenger, only other people. I'm all for privacy, but maybe comparing Telegram to ProtonMail isn't such a good idea as ProtonMail have already handed out data to multiple governments and are much less privacy friendly than Telegram.
https://digdeeper.neocities.org/ghost/email.html#ProtonMail I really want to see the server source released, it's been promised for about six years. Yes, it doesn't mean you can verify what is actually running on their servers is identical to what they have released, but it gives a good general indication about their attitude to security and privacy and how they handle your data. [deleted] They so rarely respond on Twitter. I mean, it's worth a try but no reason to expect a response. Good point. Worth trying They only respond about stickers there [deleted] Lol got downvoted. Did people even check the link? >I really want to see the server source released, it's been promised for about six years. 

\+1 Messages are not stored unencrypted but they indeed do have ways to access them I’d they wanted to. That will always be their Achille heel even thought I enjoy the possibility to use the app on many different devices (it’s the reason why they have this kind of architecture) Again, their privacy policy are opaque and unclear on the topic of encryption of default conversations and key storage. If you want privacy beyond trust, then just use secret chats. Cloud encrypted chats are for enhanced features like instantly syncing, cloud drafts, etc. While still being more secure than most of the mainstream competition. [deleted] Agreed and this is what I’m doing, when I really need to be private I simply use secret chats. The rest is private enough for me for my everyday usages. My guess is that it still helps.. anyone trying to hack your data is supposed to hack multiple data centers in this scenario"

comparing TG with Teams = comparing a banana with a chair → completely different products Telegram is mainly a personal communication platform (it's based on mobile numbers). MS Teams is not a competitor (it's complex to set up, aimed at enterprises). Skype, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp are.

However, I don't think Telegram is losing users due to to the lack of advanced video call features (for that it's widely accepted to use a dedicated external service, like Google Meet, Zoom or [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org)), but for the basic ones (WhatsApp-like): during the pandemic a lot of people would like to see their friends in real time, but on Telegram they can't. I’m only comparing “video calling” on both platforms ☺️ Im not comparing products, im only comparing “video calling” 🤦🏾‍♂️"

The fact we still don't have unlimited favorite stickers is beyond me.;210;ho1lov;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/1qry6vkjjt951.jpg;39;;2020-07-09 14:40:30;"That ""favorite"" section just shows like 5 stickers, but if you add more, they'll be gathering ""in the background"" and you'll never get access to those if you don't delete the first 5, on android. 

So I propose something like a ""favorites pack"", that if you tap in the ""favorite"" title, it will show a normal UI sticker pack but with all the stickers you've marked as favorites. I think I have at least 50 stickers sets in my Telegram.

Safe to say I have a problem. I totally agree. My Sticker game would double if I just had unlimited favorites. Maybe even folders, too. I have tons of sticker packs and I’m always searching for the good one. 
Unlimited favorite stickers and folders please!!! I didn't even know we can favorite stickers What I do is o create my own sticker pack and put it on top. I add any favorites to it. I guess it must be the same reason that we can't have more 5 pinned chats. if u look up a bot you should be able to create your own sticker pack out of a bunch of others. thats how i did mine Use Nekogram.

It's the same as telegram but with extra feature like Unlimited sticker pack Interestingly, I think the limit is already larger than five internally. If I remove a favourite sticker, another older one fills its place. I'm not sure if the limit of five is just a thing in the official clients. Also you can't search for emojis

edit: I think this issue is just for telegram x The fact that this app still doesn't support to disable stickers is beyond me. Sorry, this was unrelevant to your issue. The fact you don’t work for telegram and implement this is beyond me You can do that by using @fStikBot I reached the max (200) in 2016 like 5 days after I joined because I thought I could collect all the packs..... [deleted] How you do? The main cons is that these features are out of sync between devices That's how it works *at least on android. So it should show all of them by tapping the favorites title or something like that. [I can](https://i.imgur.com/IQDIotR.jpg) Huh? If you swipe down in the emoji panel (from Telegram), a search bar turns up. At least for me. \^\^ You can search via **:[emoji_name]**. Also via SwiftKey's or Gboard's Emojis. What do you mean yeah but you can’t access the original packs the stickers came from. i just use a bot to tag stickers so i can pull them up inline It's in Arab, how can I make my big fav stickers pack? Gotta catch 'em all! Your comment made me count mine, it was getting very hard to find the ones I like most, I have in total 134 sets but a lot of them are those which I don't use anymore. So someday I will probably prune my set. 😊 no Go to https://telegram.me/Stickers and follow instructions. ciao fra use a dark theme Maybe because I'm using Telegram X? I hate gboard Emojis and not all Emojis are included there. I couldn't search through the method you mentioned either. What do you mean? It's in English for me. Ahh, I did not notice that, I don't use it. Oops. I wasn't trying to be ironic, I edited my post after your comment :)"

I have this same problem and it’s been over a year. Only option seems to be deleting the messages one by one which is basically impossible, telegram needs to fix this issue ASAP!!!! Which platform are you on, if  I may ask? I never had this on Android but maybe I delete my chat history too often for it to happen. I got it to work. I had about 6 months of daily chats out there. I manually deleted the bulk of the messages (I would bulk select a day at a time... ugh the thumb scrolling pain) and once I got down to about 3 weeks of messages I was able to use telegrams deletion. But then I don’t know for sure it was deleted from the remote party. Unlike deleting a message where it’s for sure gone between both of us.

Is the bulk clearing/deletion just broken? IOS [deleted] I deleted manually hundreds of messages. Once I got it down to a smaller number of messages I did the clear history and it worked. Took a long time but it works. 

I think it must grab the entire list of messages to be deleted then iterate through deleting them and it just goes slowly. Possibly had I been able to keep my phone unlocked for a very long time it would have handled the full load from the beginning but I think it just isn’t made to handle so many deletions at once."

It's the same as normal telegram, but with extra functions. It have folders, just clic on chat name and hold, it appear No secret chats They were Iranian. After Telegram got banned, they didn't work with the government like Gold Telegram and Telegram plus. So they removed the app from the Iranian app store Bazaar. It is but it hasn't been updated in a while. Doesn't have multi choice polls and animated stickers. Last I heard from them they do not have any plans to continue development. Others clients make it easier, like Download center and much more. What does it add? They do not exist anymore? I mean, great if that's something that's important for you. But I just use telegram to chat with my friends, I don't need anything like that. 
""Nekogram adds some extra features to official Telegram app:

• Select a map preview provider for normal dialogs.

• Promote/restrict user directly from contextual menu clicking on user's message.

• Show user chat history in groups from contextual menu clicking on user's message.

• Delete single downloaded file.

• Customize stickers display size.

• Show and export message details.

• Store cache into app's private directory.

• Hide proxy sponsor channels.

• Toogle to show sensitive media contents in public channels.

And other...""

I use a lot the translation and the repeat function.

The layout is the same as telegram No. I like the emojis part. Telegram uses the iOS emojis which to me look horrible, I don't understand why people love them. To me the best emojis are Google emojis. I can't say that iOS emojis are bad, I do like them... But I admit that I really like more the Google ones, those kind of blend more with the UI when I used them with Telegram X. 

But now it's hard (or basically impossible) for this to change because of the new animated emojis based on iOS design. Telegram X on Android you can choose which ones you want to use, if I remember correctly. It's there in the settings somewhere. Well, not horrible but I like the Google ones much more. I know, also on Telegram Desktop."

media in tweet: None Glad to see the app that took money from the CIA try to act morally superior. Even better, considering the author of the piece they're quote tweeting stopped by to point out they're wrong: https://twitter.com/tomgrundy/status/1280172506117050369 I like signal wording better than telegrams. Hmm. Makes it seem telegram had given data before Shots fired :D source? >Glad to see the app that took money from the CIA try to act morally superior.

Source? :D

Considering Telegram is funded with blood money Durov got by spying on VKontatke users, I find this ""Accuse the other party and deny everything"" mentality indistinguishable from propaganda. What??? Money from US gov?? Wow now the only one I really trust is Keybase... even over Zoom movement The problem isn't really if they've complied, the problem is they **can comply if they want.** The architecture is all wrong. The thing is, the NSA doesn't fuck around or throw in the towel if Durov says no to data request. Telegram is a foreign company and thus what the NSA considers ""Fair Game"": They will use a zero day exploit to compromise the Linux kernel of the Telegram server (nothing Telegram can do about that), they will use a privilege escalation exploit to allow arbitrary code to run in the CPU in kernel mode. This allows the exploit to read database encryption key from the RAM (Telegram says the key is split into multiple countries but that's just the at-rest copy of the key, the in-use key must by definition be in the working memory of the server to be used for creating encrypted database entries). They can then dump the entire encrypted message database from the Telegram server, decrypt it with the stolen key, and read anyone's private messages. The only way to prevent this is to end-to-end encrypt everything, but alas, they don't.

The fact Durov does not understand this or that he ignores this shows how little he understands about infosec. Telegram is a beautiful app but it fails at what's important. Majority of users come to it for privacy, but they're delivered less than they expect. See [https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hn1uwq/telegram\_damage\_control/](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hn1uwq/telegram_damage_control/) for an example, of a disappointed user who thought Telegram was more secure than it actually was. [Here](https://surveillancevalley.com/blog/government-backed-privacy-tools-are-not-going-to-protect-us-from-president-trump). The relevant bit:

> The money primarily comes through the federal government’s premier Internet Freedom venture capital outfit: Open Technology Fund, which works closely with the State Department’s regime change arm and is funded through several layers of Cold War CIA cutouts — including Radio Free Asia and the Broadcasting Board of Governors.

> You won’t find it anywhere on Open Whisper System’s website, but Signal depends on NatSec cash for continued survival. Exactly how much cash is hard to gauge, as Open Whisper System refuses to disclose its financing structure. But if you tally up documents released by Radio Free Asia’s Open Technology Fund, we know Marlinspike’s outfit received $2.26 million in the span of the past three years — not exactly pocket change. And the NatSec cashflow shows no sign of ending. >	The only way to prevent this is to end-to-end encrypt everything, but alas, they don’t.

Some questions:

1.	I thought Telegram does this if you use Secret Chats?
2.	Doesn’t WhatsApp use E2E encryption but if you backup your chat history, to iCloud for example, it’s not encrypted?
3.	So if someone backups their chat history because they don’t want to lose it, then what’s the difference between backed up WhatsApp and cloud synced Telegram? 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

Long live to Telegram. You're giving a source that provides no source itself. You're just citing someone's claims. Also this age old ""whose money you take the songs of you sing"" mentality doesn't really work with open source projects. If the money has been used to bribe OWS to place in a backdoor or other method by which to spy on users, you would be able to point to it in the source code. Nobody has done that so far.

Compare that to Telegram that openly states they don't use E2EE for everything. The backdoor that would compromise Signal to the point of abandonment is a ""feature"" in Telegram. > I thought Telegram does this if you use Secret Chats?

Like I said, **The only way to prevent this is to end-to-end encrypt everything**. Telegram doesn't do that.

>Doesn’t WhatsApp use E2E encryption but if you backup your chat history, to iCloud for example, it’s not encrypted?

Yes, just like Telegram does if you backup anything.

>So if someone backups their chat history because they don’t want to lose it, then what’s the difference between backed up WhatsApp and cloud synced Telegram?

Nothing. If you use shitty cloud backup like the one in WhatsApp or Telegram you won't benefit anything from E2EE. The problem is, both apps suck because you can't store client-side encrypted backups on cloud. At least Signal's working on secure value recovery that might allow it one day. Alright, here's another source. If you don't like this one, this was also mentioned on Washington Post: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/05/whatsapp-rolls-out-full-encryption-to-a-billion-messenger-users

Open-source or not, taking money from the CIA is a horrible move. For Signal, it's literally getting into bed with the enemy. Yeah well when the money comes from a non-profit like OTF as a donation, it doesn't come with strings attached. USG benefits from private internet in that their advanced capabilities might not be hindered but smaller nations can't eavesdrop on communications, which furthers power asymmetry. If the money came from In-Q-Tel I'd understand your concerns. 

Also see from https://pando.com/2015/03/01/internet-privacy-funded-by-spooks-a-brief-history-of-the-bbg/ how many other projects have taken money from USG.

Do you think all of those including Tor Project are somehow ""compromised"" because they've been funded by the US?

Also, how is money made by spying on users better? It doesn't sound like Durov has a long history of respecting people's privacy. Well tor was entirely created by US Navy doesn't mean that it shouldn't be used. You sound like a conspiracy nut."

Telegram File Limit Size;179;hm9b4f;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hm9b4f/telegram_file_limit_size/;42;Telegram increased its file size limit by 500mb,earlier it was 1.5gb,now it's 2gb.Enjoy;2020-07-06 18:06:24;"Isn't the WhatsApp limit still something like 200MB? 😂 Niceeeee.  Hate how Discord even with Nitro (of which I refuse to pay for) has a limit of only a measly 50MB so this is great to see as I'm a pretty much daily user of Telegram. Meanwhile Discord doesn't even let me upload files larger than 8 megabytes... And it doesn't even compress photos so if I take a photo with my phone's camera, it'll send a 5 megabyte file which takes excessively long compared to if it packed it to something like 500 kilobytes...  


Telegram has so many benefits over its competitors that I wouldn't even dream of ever changing :) Imagine telegram, a 100% free service, having a 2gb upload limit while discord, which is constantly supported by many people subscribed to nitro and nitro classic, only has a tiny 8mb without nitro, and 50mb with nitro I would prefer if they buffed normal photosharing quality. That way I could send a super HD photo instead of having to share it as a file. Same with video. Just easier to send that way than a file Source? On Telegram desktop for Mac it is still 1.5 limit. Fun fact; Telegram didn’t have any file size limit awhile back and back then I had a 8gb iso in my saved messages but when they introduced the limits I had problems with crashing telegram apps. (until I deleted the ISO through telegram web) OMG, thanks for letting us know! Nice move 👍🎉🎈 hehe time to save a longass song cover... What about bots files size limit ? Has it increased from the old/limiting 50 megabytes ? Amazing news what is that in bytes? cause I was sending a Big file and archived it to 1.5GB and telegram said it was too big so then I tried 1500MB still to big I don't remember what I finally dropped it to to get it working it was still over 1.4GB but it wasn't the 1.5GB that telegram claims

&#x200B;

Edit: this was awhile ago but it would be nice to have the number clarified properly Really? :0 omg !!! <3 🤣🤣🤣🤣 All hail Durov uncle..... Media limit : 72 MB

Fuck the CCP > temporarily refuse data requests

Telegram has never ever served a data request. As per their FAQ they've so far given out exactly 0 bytes of information. Good, anyone complying with the CCP has no honor.

I'm glad to see Telegram holding on to theirs. So they'll be okay with everyone else asking? Good on them. Shouldn't let global powers push people around like they're doing in Hong Kong. Or trying to do, the people are pushing back hard, using these private apps to coordinate. Impressive to see technology used for freedom. Just use secret chats, and then telegram has  nothing to turn into any government. From what I undertand telegram does not turn over data, unless it can be proven that the account poses an eminent threat, in other words, something really serious. Would like to see a link to the report from telegram, this sounds phony anyhow. Uhm... as [Signal](https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1280166087577997312) puts it, why was Telegram even sharing data to begin with? And why did they have user data they could turn over? Don't give them a plug nickle until they redeem the time they have stolen and ASSURED that fifty years of the Common Law will remain. All these stories about which app is the best champion on the user by not handling user data to governments, is a way to deviate from the real privacy hole : METADATA
who, when, how often , social graphs, groups...
Guess what govs don't need to intimidate CEOs for user data, they just tap into the wires and scoop up the metadata, its there for anyone to grab, they dont care what we say on these apps , they are interested in big data patterns

Telegram can use this for PR marketing if telegram was E2EE, this wouldn't be an issue Temporarily Good, fuck West Taiwan. The CCP is the modern Nazi regime, Genocide, concentration camps, violent oppression/murder of political descent.

I'm glad to see people condemning them. Yep. Note: Chinese Cyber Army still has access to Telegram's user data including content of every dissident group conversation when they hack the server.

Wrong way to say no to CCP: No you can't have my data.

Right way to say no to CCP: Good luck with the end-to-end encrypted AES256 ciphertexts lol. But how many bytes have been hacked from the server without Telegram knowing? Google sucks the dick of the CCP, Apple too The article leaves out an important detail: Telegram only processes data requests for _public_ content. For example, public channels, sticker packs, and bots. Anything else is considered private and will not even be considered for a data request.

EDIT: To clarify, ""data request"" in this case can only mean a takedown request. Telegram will not send any private data related to these public entities (e.g. who the owner of a channel is) to any third-parties, including governments. Please check out the links below for more details.

Source:

- https://telegram.org/faq#q-there-39s-illegal-content-on-telegram-how-do-i-take-it-down You can see it in their official channel here: Transparency Reports
https://t.me/Transparency >Just use secret chats,

How can I do that for groups?

How can I do that on my Linux and Windows desktop OSs?

You see, there's a small problem. Telegram isn't really E2EE even if you want to opt-in. Because if you post any pedo / snuff / terrorist shits in public groups / channels, your data ought to be shared with relevant authorities. This only concern public groups. So E2EE is irrelevant here. For future reference, the word you're looking for is ""dissent"". ""Descent"" is a drop in height. Homophones can be pretty annoying and silly sometimes. I like how I’m seeing more foreigners realise this no matter which subreddit I am. Worldnews, Apple, football, games etc

It’s like every aspect of the world got a taste of CCP evil Zero. As all data sent from Telegram is encrypted and the relevant decryption are keys are split across mutiple parts of the world in different jurisdictions. You can prove it by examining their source code or just use secret chats. Yes they do. What does that even mean.

Are they outing the admins of telegram channels? Channels that very much go against their governments?

Saying they only do channels is stupid becaue that still leaves a big fucking privacy hole. is there any way to confirm if that channel is official?
transparency report should include the number of requests asked also. The small problem is this thread, telegram does not entertain any government requests. You should read their user terms. Why wouldn't dissidents use private groups with E2EE if they could? Thanks buddy! Never can remember that one. It”s VERY IMPORTANT that the world has its eyes on Hong Kong. Because the Chinese Government, even though ruthless and merciless to their enemies/opponents are not out for direct confrontation with the West 
   When there are reports in the mass media about the Conflict in Hong Kong, they will do what has to be done from their POV to maintain order (eg. Policing, Guards, Riot Squads). They know they have time, and the attention span of the media is short.
   The bad things start to happen the minute interest in the West dies down, or is replaced by news deemed more “relevant“ to them. You could even see it now with the Corona Lockdowns. This couldn’t have come at a better Time for China. They also used to lost momentum of the movement to pass new „anti terror „ laws I believe.

Also. Dear people of Hong Kong 🇭🇰: As much as I admire your struggle against the state. Be smart about it. 
   While the sympathies,solidarity of the West is a nice thing, the only thing of real value you can expect from the West is media coverage and their attention, as this is a what China fears could damage the country’s standing, influence, and business opportunities.

   So in a lot of ways this conflict on one side will boil down to Information Warfare - Public perception of “the Truth”, and influencing it to your advantage. 
   The CPP will use state-propaganda and disinformation campaigns(incl. social media), aided by cyber warfare. And they will use their intelligence assets as agent provocateurs. 

   You, the people of HK, do not need real propaganda, you have „respectable goals, but you also MUST control the narrative - or the government will do it for you

   The other main factor to decide the conflict is UNITED CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. You - ALL THE PEOPLE OF HK - must stand together on this. From the 6 year-old to the 80+:
   When they arrest your Family, Coworkers, Leaders and fellow citizens. When they pass bogus laws meant to divide you, keep you down, and ultimately fully control you. DO NOT go on about your daily lives like nothing happened. Every action by the CCP must have a consequence. It probably should NOT be violence if can be avoided, because until the entire Island of HK gets up to fight, you don’t stand a chance (And even then what?). Also, violence will make it easier for the Government to label you Terrorists, tarnish your image - maybe even in the West. 

   As we know, media attention is a fickle bit*h ...
   Should there be a media frenzy in you favor - a point where it seems the whole world is on your side, and hopes for an immediate, independent democratic Hong Kong. Don’t EVER actually assume that someone will come to help you. The Hungarians made this mistake in 1956, The Hungarian Revolution, and they paid dearly: When they hoped for (some degree of)change and independence from Moscow, “Radio Free Europe“ - the American Radio Station partly funded by the CIA -ignited the spark of a fully Armed Revolution. Believing the West would come to their aid, they did fight and hold out “Rifles in Hand”, but of course no help came, the Russian Tanks rolled in and that was that: It was worse than before.
   So just know No foreign country will openly and directly get involved in this. The most anyone will actually do is condemn some of China’s actions, and possibly grant asylum to a lucky, well-known few.
   No. You must be smart, persistent, and    stand united. So they see the breadth of the movement. and cannot say this is a is a radical few “terrorists.
   If enough regular Hong Kong citizens stand TOGETHER with their beliefs and values,and openly project this attitude outwards, the more cautious ones will start thinking, and soon even the gray masses might reconsider. I believe there is some similarity between the HK struggle for Independence and the Cold War relationships of Eastern Block States to Moscow, even though so much is different. So at this point, maybe a good approach would be to strive for the special status Yugoslavia had during that time - no interference from Moscow.

   The people who are WITH the Chinese Puppet Regime (“good CPP citizens”) will at first feel that they are AGAINST the “Free HONG KONG citizens”, but even they might be against the though of Chinese Tanks rolling in. But if enough brave people stand up for this, there will be a point where even the cautious man in the street, and lower City Bureaucrats will overthink their affiliation. Herd mentality and will kick in, and suddenly the ones backing China will fear for their interests (if not their necks). After all, even though China is clearly the stronger party here, HK is a long way from Beijing, and they might not get everything that happens in HK (without the help of someone FROM HK. Think France during Nazi Occupation (but with no end of war in sight).

   First Goal probably should be Unity of Interest or at least consensus/compromise about the Future. This must be reached by the real people of Hong Kong.
   By this I mean the “Free Hong Kong citizens“, and the “Pro-China citizens of Hong Kong” - which include most of the local authorities as well as the mayor.
THAT IS THE EASIER PART - I fear.    Because ultimately China has to agree to anything that happens in HK. And there is sort of the touchy, sensitive issue of “Not loosing Face” here. Especially with the precedence of Taiwan 🇹🇼.

So first Hong Kong must achieve a consensus among itself: The “Democratic HK citizens” with the Authorities. This really IS NECESSARY in my opinion, since the two must at least be able to project a realistic vision to China 🇨🇳 

But, one way or the other, the real consensus must be achieved with China. And we do know that real democracy and Independence as in Taiwan will not be an option for China. It’s one hell of a negotiation, and it probably will not be resolved by words, but by deeds. I really hope the best for this beautiful City State with its very own culture and quirks, quite different from Mainland China.     #StandwithHK >Zero. As all data sent from Telegram is encrypted and the relevant decryption are keys are split across mutiple parts of the world in different jurisdictions. You can prove it by examining their source code or just use secret chats.

That's bullshit. a) there's no source available for server-side code. b) database encryption requires that the key sits in the RAM of the CPU of the server doing the encrpytion. Cold storage with Shamir's secret sharing is useless because a remote zero day exploits with privilege escalation features allow access to full RAM of the server and thus the database encryption key. Please read computer organization 101 before you embarrass yourself. Did you read the links I posted? They don't send any data to governments:

>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.

They only take content down if it violates their [Terms of Service](https://telegram.org/tos) or is a copyright violation (via DMCA).

They will not take down channels (or divulge any information) simply because a government asks. You can check it out it section 8.3: Law enforcement authorities https://telegram.org/privacy Government cyber armies have no legal limitations when it comes to foreign targets: they hack the server when they feel like it and it's game over. CCA doesn't give two shits about their citizens either so there's that. Ah, gotcha, that's fair! Almost every messenger claims that, including Zucc himself. There is really no knowing who shares your private information with the malicious elite of the world. thank you Only one problem with that. The encryption keys for each session are fragmented across many servers in different countries. but can't be proven Fair point, but privacy is coded into Telegram’s philosophy. And given Durov’s history with the governments of the world, it is fair to say that it’s extremely unlikely Telegram is in bed with any of them. Explain to me in detail how a cloud-encryption datagram gets decrypted when it reaches the server. Where is the key stored? How is it protected? How is it used? In which situations is the cloud-message in plaintext form and how long. Please check Telegram faq and other information directly on telegram's page. I checked both the FAQ and the other information. There's nothing about it there. You clearly seem to know, please explain."

Hace unos días me pasó algo que me perturba un poco. Para un poco de contexto, mi papá falleció hace casi 8 meses, él se llamaba Rafael y le solían decir ""Fayo"".

Hace unos días, mi novia me pidió que le recordará mandarle un mensaje a su hermano a cierta hora, así que decidí programar un mensaje para ella (pues sabía que seguro yo también lo olvidaría). Al llegar la hora a la que programé el mensaje me apareció la notificación del mensaje programado. Para mi sorpresa, en donde debería aparecer el nombre de contacto con el que tengo a mi novia (no se burlen) apareció ""Fayo"". Estaba muy desconcertado y le tomé captura de pantalla para tenerlo como evidencia. 

Al día siguiente, mientras hablaba por llamada con mi novia le conté esto y probé programando un mensaje nuevo para ella. Esta vez todo parecía en orden en la notificación , su nombre de contacto aparecía ahí.

¿Hay alguna forma de explicar esto?, les repito, sólo conozco lo básico de telegram y quizá hice algo sin saberlo.

To fix it:

`brew ls tdlib | grep libtdjson.dylib`
After that, set in config file: ~/.config/tg/conf.py
TDLIB_PATH = ""output of previous command""

Please, tell me if it helped you! Currently no but you can create an issue or push a PR on GitHub) Can you do that for group chats too? what's missing to support windows? >  TDLIB_PATH =

Thank you that worked! I think it might work with Windows through [windows-curses](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/windows-curses) and an appropriate [config file](https://github.com/paul-nameless/tg#configuration). Cool! 👍 Yes, theoretically it should work.  
The obvious problem, it that tg comes with pre built tdlib binary for linux and macos but not for windows. 

You can try to build tdlib for windows, this might help you: [https://tdlib.github.io/td/build.html?language=Python](https://tdlib.github.io/td/build.html?language=Python)

How Telegram can be fully end-to-end encrypted;93;hkjee5;Telegram;https://tgraph.io/e2ee-07-01;83;;2020-07-03 16:51:12;"Like you demonstrated in your own post, this would be a massive blowback to user experience. Manual backup activation, potentially losing chats if you don't, removal of features, different types of group chats, etc.

Most people on WhatsApp don't even verify keys in person which makes E2EE mostly worthless. 

Currently on Telegram people make the conscious decision to use Secret Chats if needed. If this concept were to happen you'd inconvenience all users by taking away features and complicating things while not bringing them any benefit because most won't know/care how to verify keys with contacts. The future of messaging is [Matrix](https://matrix.org/): good end -to-end encryption, self-hostable and completely open source. Their [Riot](https://about.riot.im/) web client is already good, their mobile apps... Let's say they are getting there.

However, stay tuned because they are going to rebrand everything in the coming weeks. Telegram started off really strong in this arena and if you really want privacy, the secret chats were the way to go.   I inquired about data on the their servers some time ago, and it's apparently encrypted there.  So is the missing piece encryption on every device?

Apparently encrypting group chats gets difficult and may be the last thing to tackle.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0\_lcKrUdWg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0_lcKrUdWg) >I believe with these changes Telegram's exponential growth rate will not decrease fast like WhatsApp's, and it will have 1, and possibly, 2 billion active users at some point.

Do you really think people are leaving/entering an app just because is ""secure""? This thing is actually useful compared to a niche app like Signal or some related to it. 

Even people using WhatsApp already claimed in Play Store that the app is ""boring"". There are more things than your privacy-paranoia. [deleted] There can be end to end encrypted cloud chats, Signal has recently solved this problem with qr codes, and session did a it while back ago by functioning sort of like a bitcoin wallet does using a seed. Telegram should move to do this themselves. Offtopic but I've never tried Telegram X out of laziness. Should I get rid of normal app and get X? Why create 2 apps in the first place? It's a nice sentiment but upending the app's architecture and features like this is likely to cost them more users than it'd make. E2EE is good but most people will never care about it more than they do about comfort. So a mass-market messenger has to combine usability and security, which it already does. The only thing I'd like to see is the ability to sync secret chats so you can access them on a few devices. The rest is nice in theory but it's more likely that people who care about it will stick to the niche apps that barely reach 10 million users. Not a bad thing, btw, having a choice is nice. Riot/Matrix is E2EE, synced in the cloud AND federated.

So it is possible to Telegram to do this. [deleted] Very nice article
And I'm a noob in the ""encryption"" thing but I never trusted telegram
What better advertisement can telegram get than this:  https://www.rt.com/russia/471156-fsb-telegram-refuse-fight-terrorism/amp/
And claimimg to be the safer option while it lacks way behind other messengers even behind whatsapp and facebook.
I use telegram excessively waaaay more than whatsapp and I don't even have facebook or its messenger on my phone (I know they are all the same company but I needed whatsapp for the work group) but I only put none personal data on telegram (some movies and some songs and of course grocery lists) I like the channels feature and I treat telegram like a news portal with out having to interact with anyone or hop from sites to site to check what's the new thing. Sounds amazing, mate

Only hook: the secretchats also prevent you from screenshoting, that wouldn‘t be possible on PC, so we need a solution there I'd much prefer they just release the server source. It's been six years or so. I imagine one reason they don't want to however is that they do not delete files. You can test this with the bot API, and it used to be possible to test through the regular API until they introduced file references requiring message context - which seems like a workaround to actually deleting files, otherwise unique file IDs would be fine. I wish Telegram also uses PIN ( like old BBM). That way you can invite the person and add to your chat list. No need for phone number. Currently anyone who has my number can easily send me a message like whatsapp. I hate that feature. The biggest advantage with BBM was that it was pin based. One another good feature with telegram is you can add multiple accounts in one app. Excellent feature in my opinion. They can do this, but don't want it, why?, well, it looks that Telegram is working in/for the US, Pavel:  **Unfortunately, a US court stopped TON from happening**, so Pavel the man who stood up to the Russian government is now listening to the American, wtf is that? Single app is rock solid in the end-to-end encryption department with zero input required from users and WhatsApp using the same encryption of Signals' as whole implementation has been done by Signal Team in WhatsApp.

https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/ >Manual backup activation

Doesn't have to be a thing. You can just generate a client-side encryption password for the user, ask them to write it down, and then use that password to generate a key that encrypts everything before it's uploaded. E.g. Signal is working on client-side encrypted cloud backups. Since users already **should** be using Telegram's cloud password for 2FA, that same password can protect their cloud-backups. So there's no added overhead for actually private backups / cloud storage.

>removal of features

No feature needs to be removed for ubiquitous E2EE. The only things things Telegram wouldn't work are public channels and massive supergroups, but those have no expectation of privacy anyway (since they're basically public).

>Different types of group chats

Yeah, no problem there. Telegram already has different kinds of groups: normal and super groups. Just add E2EE for normal groups. Also Telegram has different kinds of one-on-one chats: E2EE and non-E2EE. So it would actually reduce complexity if E2EE was enabled for all one-on-one chats.

>Most people on WhatsApp don't even verify keys in person which makes E2EE mostly worthless.

That's mainly because there's no way to mark them as verified, and to keep the identity keys across installation. With Signal you can already do both with secure value recovery and offline-backups, so it actually makes sense to verify them because you only need to do it once. Key verification is sure important, but even more important is to not accumulate private messages on Telegram server freely.

>Currently on Telegram people make the conscious decision to use Secret Chats if needed.

[Currently Telegram's users think it's more private than it actually is](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hn1uwq/telegram_damage_control/), and users can't opt-in for E2EE for any kind of groups. Also, because secret chats are not available for desktop clients, users don't really use them because they prefer desktop clients when possible (much faster to type on an actual keyboard), and having two conversations for each users is way too much inconvenience.

>If this concept were to happen you'd inconvenience all users by taking away features and complicating things

No features would need to be taken away. Supergroups and channels don't have to be E2EE.

>while not bringing them any benefit because most won't know/care how to verify keys with contacts.

1. Opportunistic E2EE already reduces attack surface of users. You're assuming everyone gets MITM attacked by the server, when the real problem is users are just freely giving their information to a company that can be hacked at any point. The forward secrecy matters. Also, that way Telegram can also say like Signal ""We can't give anything because we don't have anything"". That's an insanely cool new feature.
2. You're contradicting yourself. You're saying people are making conscious choice in using secret chats, but at the same time you're saying people are not making that same thing and verifying fingerprints. Why not have Telegram always do E2EE, and then have forward secrecy for messages for everyone, and MITM protection for users who consciously choose to verify fingerprints?

Don't take this message as an attack towards Telegram. I write it to explain Telegram can be more secure for its users without any inconvenience to its users. Think how awesome that would be. The very possibility of key verification makes it impossible for a service provider to perform large-scale data collection. The messaging service needs to execute an actual Man-in-the-middle attack on those users who are of interest to it. Luckily, those users are usually the ones who care about encryption and do verify their keys.

Also, it’s not necessary to verify keys in person. Making a voice or video call and verifying those 4 emojis you see in the top right corner is enough to be sure that your encryption was not compromised. Web-clients are dangerous: [https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1121.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1121.pdf) But yeah Matrix has potential, it's just not there yet. Everything needs to be E2EE by default, yet so far it isn't for all Matrix clients. >Apparently encrypting group chats gets difficult and may be the last thing to tackle.

At least Signal, WhatsApp, Wire, RiotX, Threema, Wickr Me, and TFC have already solved that. Telegram could hire a cryptographer to design E2EE group messaging protocol but apparently they haven't. They could pay OWS to implement it for them (like Google, Facebook, and apparently soon Microsoft have done), but they don't, which begs the question, why. Yes, majority does not care. But people who do care are very vocal. And I think the reason why niche apps are unpopular is not their security but simply network effect and the fact that historically these apps did not care about gimmics much. But e2ee is a feature, after all. If people who want this are a minority it does not mean it is useless. Yes i believe. Because privacy concerns are rising. You saw a lot of articles about Signal for the protestors in the last months, and none for Telegram Signal isn’t exactly niche. More people in my contacts use it than telegram. >This thing is actually useful compared to a niche app like Signal or some related to it.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning\_the\_well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well)

>There are more things than your privacy-paranoia.

If E2EE isn't important why is Telegram offering it as secret chats ;)

The only boring thing here is your ""fuck off tin foil hat"" attitude. Security is more important than ever and just because you choose to ignore it out of your privilege, doesn't mean other people can afford that luxury. I think that /u/nonzucker is wrong here. Riot/Matrix is E2EE and has a web version E2EE chats are not cloud chats by definition. You probably mean E2EE chats with client-side encrypted cloud backups. Nah. Telegram gets updated faster. Isn't X pretty outdated? I started with X and moved to the original app as features like scheduling a message isn't available in X.

edit: just looked, last update in May. Try Nekogram. One thing I like about it is the feature to do no-quote forwarding. Telegram X is proprietary, thus it's a bad idea to use it. Yesh but that's the whole point of secret chats being secure, they don't keep them on servers at all, once you logout or switch device you ought to loss them as that what they're really meant for. >The only thing I'd like to see is the ability to sync secret chats so you can access them on a few devices.

This and group chats are the minimum level of security every messaging app should have. Anything less is just asking for the next cyber attack to leak all private information. And that's just the matter of time [https://www.businessinsider.com/security-mikko-hypponen-all-fortune-500-companies-hacked-2015-10?r=US&IR=T](https://www.businessinsider.com/security-mikko-hypponen-all-fortune-500-companies-hacked-2015-10?r=US&IR=T)

""Niché apps"" is just parroting Durov's propaganda. Signal is adopting users faster than ever and unless Telegram picks up its security game soon, they are going to get stampeded. Even better, Telegram could become one of the biggest Matrix homeservers (convert from their MT proto to Matrix)... Unlikely, but one can dream. >in addition to their distributed keys

That's not a thing really. The ""distributed"" server-side key is in the RAM of the server delivering you your messages. It has to be by definition. You can store the off-line copy with Shamirs Secret Sharing and split it to arbitrary number of shards, but you can't keep the key distributed while doing encrypted database entries.

But yeah, your point that Telegram could store E2EE messages to cloud with client-side encryption is really valid.

>The only risk factor here is bruteforcing cloud chats

The Telegram client could generate a cryptographically random 128-bit mnemonic password for the user. This would make brute force attempts futile. source for your claims? prevent screenshot is always stupid when you can photograph a screen True, but I am not sure if screenshot protection is impossible on desktops. Enabling/disabling screenshot protection would either be a separate per-chat setting or depend on self-destruct timers of messages on the screen. The reason behind why Pavel would listen to the US gov and not the Russian is because the USA can actually do something to make Durov’s life harder. Don't be dense. TON was an investment platform. If the SEC bars Americans from investing in it it's not going to fill its duty. That's why it was abandoned. The US courts have no influence over Durov but they do have power over Americans. Do you have a source or are you just trolling?. don't know why you're being downvoted. it is totally possible that Telegram is collaborating with a government. the only way to be 100% sure they're not is being E2EE [deleted] Its true just make Private Chat and Groups E2EE with sync if people don't like device sync because is to unsafe for them there can still use Secret Chats. Channels, Super Groups and saved Messages can be in the Cloud :D. Well, you would need to fake the website certificate to accomplish an attack without modifying the URL, something that is not easy (doable for spying agencies). However, [Riot](https://Riot.im) is also offered as an Electron application, to avoid this problem.

On [Riot](https://Riot.im) (the standard client) everything is E2EE by default. I may be out of the loop a bit here, but I think you're making a bit too high of claim about every other messenger.  I'm not going to defend Telegram here because I don't have enough details about any of them really.  But I do know there was a time, that Telegram lead the pack and everyone else lagged behind. The question then becomes, what is the bar?  Shouldn't it simply be that only the involved parties can decrypt?  So Telegram itself shouldn't be able to read 1on1 chats and maybe small groups?  Keep in mind again, that group chat encryption is reaaaaaly hard where as 1on1 one is well established.
So let's agree on a baby step:
All messengers' 1on1 chats should be E2E encrypted such that only the participants can decrypt.

I'd love to say that's easy, but easy is rarely foolproof.  So I'd like to see all these messengers prove that an employee/admin can't decrypt/hack a chat they host. Why not vocal minority ask Signal add the features Telegram already has and what people who does not care about privacy want?. Telegram let down the Hong Kong protesters by leaving the feature -- that hides their username from non-contacts who add their phone number -- off by default. Also Telegram's group conversations lack E2EE so it's no wonder Signal has risen to the most downloaded app. Well, there have to be the kind of vegan people that like to choose something worse because of the need of ""privacy"", even though Signal has no plans to give you an ability to hide your phone number or that it's an app funded by the [OFT.](https://youtu.be/eT9XOpfP8vc).

If you were a revolutionary, then the same government that you're trying to beat gives you a tool that claims that not even them would be able to crack, ""your plans are safe"" will make you trust something like that? It's difficult to trust and scheme like that knowing that the same government is fighting with backdoors against terrorism on every social/messaging app based on the US (which is where Signal is based, also that it uses the Amazon services to host on to).

Another thing that it's interestingly available are the SMS capability, which is insecure. If your messages fail to be sent through the Internet, they'll do it through SMS which can be seen by the government. HOW CONVENIENTLY PLACED. 

All this come to trust. And if I have to do it, I would give trust a service that hasn't have [more vulnerabilities](https://youtu.be/eT9XOpfP8vc) and sketchy history behind, it has a better reason to exist (basically to protect it's main creator FROM THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT) and that it's actually useful: I don't have to be worried that my conversations with the people I care just disappear because I updated my phone to a newer android version or a new phone; using it as tool to send things to my computer from my phone and vice-versa, having the ability to enable secret chats that are only available to my device... It's just too much usefulness, convenience and why not FUN to use. E2EE on web is possible but it would be better to not implement it. Yes, i think  you're right, the bottom line is you can have the same e2ee chats on multiple devices. (Cloud chats aren't really a thing, it's just Telegram's marketing language for non-E2EE chats. A common way to refer to these is TLS-encrypted chats because it's aching to transport-only encryption similar to HTTPS sites. It's just that Telegram users tend to attack this with ""It's not TLS it's MTProto!!"" which is really bad when the E2EE is also called MTProto. It really confuses users: ""MTProto is end-to-end encryption and I heard everything in Telegram is MTProto, therefore everything is E2EE"") Cool thanks. The sole reason why I'm using X is because the main Telegram app doesn't have the instant lock time out. The minimum time out for main app is like 10 seconds I think? And X can lock instantly every time I exit the app. TgX does support scheduled messages, but yeah, it gets updated slower.

However the thing is: Telegram for Android is considered as ""main"" app for Android and more ""streamline"", while TgX offers some other user experience with better animations or some cool features which are not in other apps (f.ex. forward as copy). Also TgX is built on top of  [https://core.telegram.org/tdlib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib), which encapsulates all Telegram-related things. Literally any book on cryptographic design allows you to derive these schemes. There's nothing novel about client-side encrypted backups. They've been used in e.g. Tahoe-LAFS, Cryptomator enabled clouds, Spider Oak cloud, and NextCloud. Also online-password managers like LastPass do just that.

**Btw, in this subreddit you can't write bad things about Telegram, so be careful, fanaticism here is something.**

And another thing, have you read about the recent Telegram's data breach?, there's not a single article about that here. So would you say we should trust telegram to tell us when their servers are hacked and every group message is stolen? Or do you think Telegram should adopt E2EE for everything to ensure you don't have to trust their word? Well the point of E2EE apps is to mitigate the assumption the adversary's undermining server / TLS connection ;)

But yeah, native clients be it Electron or something else are much better.

>On [Riot](https://riot.im/) (the standard client) everything is E2EE by default.

Riot for Android isn't E2EE by default, only RiotX is. But I do know there was a time, that Telegram lead the pack and everyone else lagged behind.

No it never lead the pack. Telegram was first released in August 2013. It didn't feature E2EE by default then, and it doesn't do it now. Signal was released as TextSecure in May 2010 and it was E2EE by default even then, and has done so for more than 10 years.

>Shouldn't it simply be that only the involved parties can decrypt?

I think that's a fair assessment. There's two aspects in private communication

1. Privacy of content (protected by E2EE)
2. Privacy of metadata (protected by anonymity tech like Tor)

Because both Signal and Telegram offer low latency calls, anonymity with too high latency Tor can't come to question, so what matters is privacy of content, like you said ""only the involved parties can decrypt \[the conversation\]"".

>So Telegram itself shouldn't be able to read 1on1 chats and maybe small groups?

To list the aspects

1. E2EE needs to be available for all clients (Signal has it, Telegram doesn't)
2. E2EE needs to be available for all chat types (Signal has it, Telegram doesn't)
3. E2EE needs to be enabled by default (Signal has it, Telegram doesn't)
4. E2EE needs to be cross-platform (Signal has it, Telegram doesn't)
5. E2EE needs to be based on best practices (Signal has it, Telegram doesn't)
6. E2EE needs to be open source (True for both)
7. E2EE needs to be easy to authenticate (Signal is easier with QR-codes and base-10 fingerprints)
8. E2EE needs to use modern algorithms (Telegram has bad track record, Signal doesn't)
9. E2EE needs to handle key change with warnings (Signal has it, Telegram just spawns new chats without alerting the user about possible attack)
10. E2EE needs to allow remembering when fingerprints have been verified (Signal has it, Telegram doesn't)

>Keep in mind again, that group chat encryption is reaaaaaly hard

Well that's just the thing I said in the message you replied to. Tons of apps have already done it, why hasn't Telegram even tried?

>So I'd like to see all these messengers prove that an employee/admin can't decrypt/hack a chat they host.

You need to study the basics of cryptography to understand how the attacks against E2EE work. None of the apps I listed really allow MITM attacks, although with proprietary apps it's pretty much impossible to say if there's something foul. The thing is though, when E2EE isn't available, the chat is guaranteed to be insecure. Telegram can always read your group and Windows/Linux desktop chats, and that's the problem. Who said they don't? >Why not vocal minority ask Signal add the features Telegram already has and what people who does not care about privacy want?

They are, and Signal is already implementing those. Even stickers are now available for E2EE.

Why not ask Telegram developers to make Telegram as secure as Signal? :> Why defend insecurity? >even though Signal has no plans to give you an ability to hide your phone number

>It's difficult to trust and scheme like that knowing that the same government is fighting with backdoors against terrorism

Durov served in the Russian army and specialized in information warfare. It's hard to trust Durov has no ties on Russian government after that. See how easy it is to poison a well.

Also, show us the backdoor: [https://github.com/signalapp](https://github.com/signalapp)

>If your messages fail to be sent through the Internet, they'll do it through SMS

That's not the case, you have to explicitly choose insecure SMS to send one. Maybe check your facts.

>sketchy history behind,

How vague. Also, Telegram isn't E2EE by default. It's not E2EE for groups or for majority of desktop clients.

>I don't have to be worried that my conversations with the people I care  just disappear because I updated my phone to a newer android version or a  new phone

Up-to-date client side stack has nothing to do with server side vulnerabilities and given that everything is stored in a way that allows entities who hack Telegram server to read their private conversations, you're still at risk

>having the ability to enable secret chats that are only available to my device... It's just too much usefulness

And how do you do that for groups and Windows/Linxu desktop clients?

>FUN

E.g. people in Hong Kong need to factor in the risk of being jailed, and when Telegram's dissident group chats aren't secure, the FUN is less FUN. I understand you're talking from your own perspective, but strongly consider checking your privilege. why did Matrix/RIOT then? humm 1 minute

Ywah that‘s pretty annoying Just tap the little lock button on the top right if you want it to lock right away Thanks Wait tgx has extra features? But it doesn't prevent it. Secret chats are the most secure option, and not making it cross-platform will hurt uptake of secret chats which will hurt Telegram users more than users taking photos of their screen. That's not a source for his claims. It only sources the only true part - Telegram stopping TON because of a clash with the SEC. The conspiracy theory about government collaboration is totally unfounded and is the reason why the guy is getting downvoted. This isn't how logic works, mate Yes, because data breach contains only OPEN data (everyone can view it). Telegram secret chats is fully E2E encrypted and this is confirmed. Durov newer collaborated with *any* gov, at least publicly [deleted] I'm in agreement here.  Let me be clear that Signal has been far better when it comes to privacy and security than any other.  When I refer to Telegram, I'm grouping it in the common place cloud chat apps like WhatsApp, WeChat, and FB messenger.  You can't unplug the ownership of FB from the equation.  Telegram get's a pass here from me because of the open source clients which does give it some level of transparency.  But, not a full pass across the board tho.

I'm not a crypto pro, but neither am I a total noob.  I don't need to go too deep into the woods to know that once you introduce a middle-man (cloud server) you enter a realm of trust with that entity that is hard to assure 100% safety.  So other than Signal, I have trust issues with other messengers.  And I never place sensitive information on any platform as trust can come and go.

In the long term, Telegram will have to improve.  

Side note:
Some features of Telegram could be effectively made useless if E2EE is enabled like their search capability.  It would require a full download of content in order to be assured safety.  If they have a key, is it really E2EE? > Well that's just the thing I said in the message you replied to. Tons of apps have already done it, why hasn't Telegram even tried?

You say tons.  I think you are making too many assumptions here about what other apps are really doing.
A group chat of 3?  Ok easy enough.  But larger groups you might as well forget about it.
Repost: https://youtu.be/Q0_lcKrUdWg Some people who do not care about privacy are asking for video calls and other features. If in my case i find security as a priority i would just move to Signal, i have no problem using two messengers. Because they're not the smartest tool in the shed or read existing findings by security researchers like [https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1121.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1121.pdf)

The problems of repeated JS delivery have been known for long time now, and it didn't need Kobeissi to formalize the problem to acknowledge its existence. I did that during the early days using the main app but that just tires me a bit. If Telegram implements this feature I'd switch without second guess for sure. >We never know how they implemented it.

OWS helped them [https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/](https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/)

Hard to say if any changes have been made but it's still better to take the tiny risk of backdoor than use apps that don't do it at all (indistinguishable from backdoored by design). >  Telegram get's a pass here from me because of the open source clients which does give it some level of transparency

That's part of the problem, people assume it's more private because client doesn't have anything malicious about them. The thing is, telegram happily sends all of your data by default to the server. And we don't know absolutely anything about what happens on server-side. There's no source, and even if there was, we couldn't trust it.

>I'm not a crypto pro, but neither am I a total noob.

Well it's a good thing I've researched privacy, surveillance and cryptography for almost 10 years now.

>In the long term, Telegram will have to improve. 

Fully agreed.

>Some features of Telegram could be effectively made useless if E2EE is enabled like their search capability.

Signal has full search for messages provided you store a copy on client-side. It's not text that's the problem, it's media. Can you search inside videos and photos in Telegram? Yup. It's not a problem.

> If they have a key, is it really E2EE?

No, but that's not something that's required. Forget about it? Then why are apps like Signal just acing it? Group DH is hard, for loop over private messages with group headers is not. Appreciate your reply...
I know Signal is better.  But Telegram is an easier transition for most people.  The open source clients actually help a quite a bit as each client improves at a reasonable pace.
For now... Like any service, I have a reasonable trust/distrust that I avoid simple pitfalls like storing/sending passwords, or even leaving certain conversations behind.  I tell my friends and family, ""Nothing is to be fully trusted.  Use it for what it's good for.""

For the most part, I find Telegram a better option vs the alternatives.  Except that, Signal is clearly superior if privacy/security is the priority. I would use Signal if I knew anyone that was using it. :("

That’s the only thing I miss from android Telegram is not a dropbox and not a google drive.. at least this is not its primary usage scenario.  
I would assume having background download many people will be misusing the app creating high load on the servers. Thanks a ton! I turned off the battery saver and now background download on Telegram works like a charm. That's because iOS restricts a lot of background stuff iOS sucks True indeed. Telegram would definitely want to be a secure IM alternative to Whatsapp but most of current users are attracted to it primarily due to it's capability of handling huge files with relative ease. Moreover it's new users are lured into using it due to the huge pool of pirated content available freely and securely instead of relying on suspicious torrents. 
It's servers are very well capable I would assume because that's what Telegram has always been proud of: secure backed up IM data (which is the biggest security flaw in any other commercially accepted IM service).

Automatic Switch to Dark Mode;3;hjrb21;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hjrb21/automatic_switch_to_dark_mode/;0;"Hey everyone. Since this feature hasn't still been implemented on Desktop versions, I thought maybe I could do it using a script and then do it with Task Scheduler on Windows. There was no related keys or values in Registry. The only thing I found was a file named ""settingss"" (yes with two s's!) in the install directory. Opening it with Notepad results in random undecipherable characters. So, what I did was change the theme, backup the new settingss file, change the theme back to what it was, and then replace the settingss file with the one I backed up. While it didn't change the theme while Telegram was running, restarting Telegram *did* swtich the theme.

Now, I have two questions:

1- Do you know any way to actually edit that file? I mean like see it in something like a JSON format where you could change a single key-value pair.

2- Is there anyway to ask Telegram to kind of ""reload"" the new settingss file after it's been changed, so that the theme changes even when the app is running?";2020-07-02 08:45:53;

It's like something to do with the way the apps interact, Telegram being unable to just open the maps without the user's 'permission' (permission being actually opening the maps.) Might be some kind of map in Google Maps. There's some caching involved. If some time has passed, viewing a sent location or sending your own location takes ages to load the map contents for no apparent reason, even if you have several apps running in parallel that heavily use the precise current location (e.g., Niantic games, Geocaching, other apps using location/maps).

Do the same action a couple of seconds later again, and Telegram works fast as light-speed. Map data is just there in an instant. It's some internal caching. And I don't think it's about the location alone, that doesn't need such a long time even if GPS was powered down (which it was not, anyway). It's something about the map data content, like the streets, buildings etc.

Wait a couple of minutes, and Telegram forgets about any cached data and hangs again when loading the map. The bug exists for a long time. Some devices seem to be more affected than others. Unfortunately, my devices always had this problem.

Seems like nobody is using location features in Telegram, otherwise this would have been a big issue already. Very interesting! I did disable Google Maps... I will update you Ok definitely not working w/o Google Maps"

Video calls in .... JULY? 🤞;403;hjb5ps;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/31ej0qye99851.png;61;;2020-07-01 17:23:55;"It could be Monda**y**, Tuesda**y**, Wednesda**y**, Thursda**y**, Frida**y**, Saturda**y** or Sunda**y**. Eventually [deleted] as I know, this feature is right now in beta test, and you can try it, also probably it will be really in July BTW the original question wasn't mine. 

I've seen somewhere that video calls *will* be added this year, so keeping my fingers crossed. When it's ready. It’s already being tested so, by the end of the month if everything goes right 🤞

Edit: Only iOS for now v 6.3 I was literally talking about it today It's probably Taco Tuesday! I'm pretty sure this is a joke, referring to the fact that all weekdays end in y. January? Why are people excited for video calls. Voice calls on Telegram sucks so I expect video to be just as bad or worse. They should have focused on fixing audio first. Twenty-twenty? 

But I'm really hyped for this month, honestly. This month is like ""probably"" the next one is ""most probably"" because of the Telegram birthday (August 14th). I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/dubai] [X-post from r\/Telegram, calling functionality may be coming soon... Wonder if the govt will allow it since Telegram is kinda HQ'd in Dubai?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/hjvwb2/xpost_from_rtelegram_calling_functionality_may_be/)

&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* Or maY Someday 2030 One day. well, we all know durov likes to troll, but, video calls are there on ios :P twenty twenty Next anniversary? July 13 is my birthday. 😌 December**y** release confirmed There are more apps out there for video calling
Telegram is just good for messaging and community. May February 29th I hope its not ""hopefully"" WednesdaY! but... what year and month? maybe Y is year, end of year True, but I'm routing for July. You make me laugh, you are right as this is a long waiting feature.  
BUT my optimistic mind make me vote for July as OP! Could also be today or yesterday Lol. !RemindMe 2 months !RemindMe 14 August 2020 !RemindMe 2 months One on one video calls are actually already in the iOS beta version! They've promised to release group ones right away, though, so I assume they'll test that out as well before they release them. Mostly I give voice calls a four or five star rating, but my network connection tends to be quite reasonable. They work fine for me The problem is that Whatsapp is doing pretty good job and most of the people not need more than what Whatsapp offers. [deleted] They add new features really fast, so I believe it will release this month Could also be January, February... I hope you're right though maybe **Y**ear It’s a high bet. If it’s not July then it’s JanuarY 2021 SomedaY I was thinking about May, 2021 **Defaulted to one day.**

|-|-|-|-| Sadly to say but Telegram voice calls are trash compare to Whatsaap and thats what i am afraid of. Even though they will release a video calls it will be also not really useful. If you want to attract people to Telegram the so much talking feature should work very well that you won't mind switching. 😆 *The hype is increasing...* [deleted] nope, not january or february, they said on 2020. Two thousand and twenty Yeah, but januarY is next year and the feature has officially been touted for this year 😋 Again, I don't know if you have any objective data out it is just your personal experience. For me they work just fine. It could be Octombruary too. Well, it's already July, can't wait for it Decembery maybe.. July is already on its 2/3rd. So it's this year at least! If all or most the people you are voice calling are in the same country as you, or in a rich country with cheap fast internet that sure, you experience is probably good. But when you got friends and family all over the world, including developing countries, you see the difference. It could be two thousand and fifty"

"How is this possible? ""Police monitored RSVP lists on Facebook events, shared information about Slack channels protesters were using, and cited protesters' posts in encrypted messaging apps like Telegram.""";8;hitx2e;Telegram;https://www.businessinsider.com/blueleaks-how-cops-tracked-george-floyd-protesters-on-social-media-2020-6;5;[deleted];2020-06-30 22:08:26;Were these telegram channels public? It says some were private/closed? The monitored chats could have mentioned telegram without providing access. Sadly, even private channels or groups can be compromised infiltrated by a single mole. If a police officer poses as a protester and gets into a private group, they can read what people say and use it against them IF they can prove who the person is. This is why it's strongly recommended to thoroughly vet people before adding them to protest groups and to never reveal your personal info there. Keep your phone number hidden since Telegram allows it, don't have your own photo as the profile pic and try to make a username that doesn't trace back to your other accounts. Keep fighting the good fight. Yes, a mole is certainly a possibility. I dont know why it made it seem (the article) that police/law enforcement had been able to gain access to some telegram channels in nefarious ways (hacking, etc). [deleted] You’re right, of course

Just to understand better what’s going on. Maybe it’s just suggested stickers and you consider them NSFW but they’re not?  Sounds weird You might have added a sticker pack that got updated with some NSFW stickers and that's why they're getting recommended. The thing is that Telegram can only recommend official packs or ones you have saved and official packs don't have NSFW content. So the only option I see is some pack among the ones you saved sneakily adding NSFW stuff. [removed] But can you provide an example? The stickers telegram shows when you type an emoji are always the same, so it shouldn't be hard to find these nsfw stickers again and screenshot them

Finnaly! Already present and used in Unigram. Telegram Windows Desktop Beta, macOS version has had this for quite a while now, secret chats too My Telegram auto-updated to this beta and I had to revert since they did something to Qt that made it not use system notifications and decorations (On KDE). Also had a glitch with messages not being marked as read. on the macOS Telegram it had been there for years lol I've been using since the beginning of the year (Android) Can we have dark mode on web. Telegram. Com? thanks I wish video calls are available soon Depends on what you mean

Creating and writing secret chats on desktop
Or
Accessing the secret chats from phones on your desktop They're available on Unigram. Is this just fantasy Settings -> Advanced -> Scroll to bottom -> Enable ""Install beta versions"". That's what I was using too, and now I can uninstall it :D it’s about windows’ desktop app maan. Have you tried Stylish? It might help. Would take time, I guess. It's yet to be available on mobile apps. Surfaced on iOS beta last week. Secret chats are per-device. So, the ones created/managed on the phone apps, cannot appear on the desktop apps.

So, I was referring to the former - create/manage secret chats on the desktop app. Mac native app already has this feature. It's the desktop version (aka Windows version) that's missing it. In the meantime, I use a third-party app called Unigram that supports secret chats. Yup, [I already use it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hihy33/multiaccount_support_is_now_in_telegram_desktop/fwgy1mu/).

Normal, cloud chats dont get missed, if u account isnt deleted because of inactivity (check security settings). Just to clarify, your account is set to self-destruct after 6 months of inactivity by default.

Does this problem happen to you too? Yes, this works. Telegram ha la funzione per cancellare la cache try clearing the whole message/media cache from here?

So do I always have to go through this to solve this Si well after clearing the cache the messages will be gone so, thats the point.
but it only happens on ios as far as i know ( what others told me , as i said i never had a ios ) unless you delete your messages using ur ios"

How come telegram admins get arrested these days Isn't telegram fully encrypted.

Plenty of ways to unmask someone's identity that don't involve simply being handed it by Telegram. Social engineering, investigative work into the same alias on other platforms (and potentially court orders against those platforms), analysis of writing style to link aliases, sting operation etcetera. Chances are if someone is doing something illegal on Telegram, law enforcement may already have a tab on them from other activities outside of the app and whatever they are doing on Telegram only adds to the evidence against them. [deleted] Telegram admins can get arrested because they are humans that exist in the real world, subject to the laws of their country of residence. But how telegram dosent provide their info to govt agencies.. But it also doesn't prevent a cop from just joining a public group?.. [deleted] I heard they wont handle user info.

3) Is there any way in a private channel to prevent a member from forwarding the content of the channel?    Allowing forward to always be on would largely circumvent some of the main reasons for making a channel private.   If you have a small workgroup and you are sharing potential logos for a product, you do not want that sensitive information being forwarded without any controls.";2020-06-27 12:17:00;">How do you mark a Telegram private channel as NSFW?

You can't. If someone reports your channel and Telegram notices NSFW content, they'll mark it themselves.

>Is there any way to completely void the link to join the channel

Yes, go to channel -> Edit -> Channel Type -> Revoke link (on Android)

>always require members to be manually processed by an admin?

Yes and no. You have different options: 1) manually edit each person to channel, unless they disable this in their Privacy Options. Note that if you add someone, they will see a ""Report spam and leave"" button on top of screen. 2) make a bot which will send user a link and then revoke it in several minutes. But if a person is quick enough, multiple people can join with bot's link. There might be any other options which I'm unaware of.

>prevent a member from forwarding the content of the channel

No, not possible. Honestly this is useless, since anyone can just screenshot/photo/download content from Telegram channel. If you revoke the link, it simply creates a new link.   I was hoping to find a way to support having no link at all. The secret chat feature - at least under Android - prohibits the use of screenshots.   So I imagine that a channel that is marked with ""forwarding disabled"" could employ the same API to prohibit screenshots or downloads.

Yes, people can photograph the device when it shows an image, but most people are way too lazy to do that.  You effectively stop most of that behavior by interacting with the OS APIs to prohibit saving the image or taking a screenshot of the image.   Snapchat built a whole business around doing that. If you create a new link and don't send it to anyone, you can consider it as ""no link"", bruteforce is nearly impossible the API is an Android API, and it doesn't support Telegram-specific features like forwarding or downloading. Sure, but in a channel with multiple admins, you might expect that one of the admins could release a link, so you have the possibility to lose control Of course, but I was referring to two different features together.   If Telegram implemented a ""forwarding disabled"" option for channels, then of course Telegram is using its own code to implement that.   But Telegram could additionally employ the Android API to prohibit screenshots of any image in a ""forwarding disabled"" channel. Every admin in channel has their own invite link (incl. bots)"

[News] US Senators introduce bill to FORCE all device and software providers in the US to build backdoors into their products. Bill would make encryption ILLEGAL unless it had a backdoor for the US government.;3;hgpo39;Telegram;https://www.androidauthority.com/lawful-access-to-encrypted-data-1132922/;3;;2020-06-27 11:11:17;"[deleted] If you are an American, [contact your two US senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm). Tell them to vote **NO** on the **Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act**.

https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm

Telegram is not based in the United States, so it would not directly affect them necessarily. The law would not prevent users from continuing to use Telegram either. However, if the bill passes, it further establishes such a precedent for other nations to follow, and for further legislation to be passed requiring encryption data to be unencrypted on demand (like in Australia), or outlawing encryption outright. The bill is atrocious, and the EFF has already spoken out about it. It's even worse than the EARN IT Act from three months ago.  For these reasons, even non-Americans should be concerned.

Essentially, it does nothing to stop criminals from downloading and using encrypted software, or encrypting data on backdoored devices, but it does put a **huge** blow to average Americans for any American encrypted software that they use. Moreover, it further sets the precedent that encryption and privacy = bad/illegal/etc., and opens a ton of bad doors. Here is a change.org petition! http://chng.it/XBwkjyjkjS If your senator says they support the bill because ""encryption helps child trafickers and terrorists"", respond with this:

Tell him/her that this bill won't do anything to stop CP or trafficking. Criminals will just keep using non-backdoored software or put encrypted files onto backdoored devices. All this bill does is hurt average Americans, because it's a huge security risk having a backdoor. It will be used by even more criminals to access Americans' personal info. Additionally, it will hurt US companies and may cause some/many to leave. Not to mention, **we have a right to privacy**

Bottom line is it **won't stop criminals**"

And cdn servers are equipped with petabytes of storage. So that telegram users can host virtually unlimited GBs. I know there are many channels that uploads TBs of pirated content but none of them survives indefinitely. When they get deleted, there's TBs of free space. You also can create a private chat with yourself, but should add someone first and then just delete this person from the chat. Now you have your own private chat. tru I have more messages sent to myself then to my best friends. so im not the only one Next step make your own solo-channels or groups so you can sort stuff. It's good but I miss WhatsApp starred messages. Related question, Do they periodically delete saved messages? I've had my account for years, And I didn't just start using Saved Messages this past March, but that's as far as the history goes. Would someone dm me and explain the trick? Create a private channel with no members I think because files are forwarded a not uploaded every time for each user it decreases a load on telegram services I have something like 2700 photos there [deleted] Well Telegram already put restrictions on upload and download speed on Telegram to  demotivate User to waste telegram's Server space and bandwidth.

That's how you can't utilizes full bandwidth on Telegram and get relatively  slow downloading & uploading speed as compared to downloding file from other platforms even your internet  connection is fast. the thing is, telegram stores some kind of identifier on their servers, thus eliminating duplicates by just providing symlinks to the file My guess is by using ‘cold storage’. After a few days a file will be uploaded to cold storage where the cost per GB for hosting is significantly less due to the fact demand to download the file after a few days is reduced exponentially. [That's Interesting](https://tlgur.com/d/GayjV2WG) Yeah, I use it as a notepad which I can use back and forth on my Android phone and on my MacBook. I am interested. Please continue. I usually use Samsung notes. But that's an outstanding idea. How's the privacy though¿. Just create a channel. What's the benefit? You can make your own bot account (talking to @BotFather) an then use this bot to create groups and kick it without anybody having to know. Yeah, I'd like to mark important messages in private chats without need of forwarding it to saved messages. Forward to saved messages works very well, too You mean March 2019 or 2020? there's no trick you can have unlimited space, but it's limit to 2GB per individual file If you have 2700 pictures, you are in year 2700 [deleted] Android device channels upload hundreds of custom roms and recoveries My upload and download speed on telegram have always been so slow and I thought it was an issue with my internet connection .... Never knew this was a thing! Thanks for the info OP you've saved me lots of router reboots. proofs , source .

you from India Right ? It seems they don't delete files either as you can still access them by their ID through the APIs, so I wonder how much they are paying to store files that no longer exist in any chats. I don’t get it can someone explain the process. No one contacted me about my furry trump fan fiction yet so I guess good enough Yeah, probably would be the same. :) more infinite storage You can organize your messages, split/divide them. 2020. [deleted] I am following few android channels and nobody uploads roms to telegram. They might upload recovery or any flashable zips that are generally >50mb. Could you please link me the channel that does this? I was about to comment the same thing... It's more profitable not to delete files because of fragmentation btw

Also, bandwidth is more expensive than capacity Imagine your mixed emotions when Hollywood calls telling you they loved it and you're going to be the next J. K. Rowling. Not the same. Private chats including groups can be exported as a html file from a pc. But you can't export a channel. Twice as infinite! Yeah I have multiple channels for different links. Android, PC, fitness, etc. >2020

I have saved messages at least since November 2019, so that might be an error/bug on your side I have like 100gb of ~~porn~~ saved messages Most give the download link in google drive or source forge.only small fixes they directly gives links Still seems weird, there's surely millions of private photos shared in one to one chats which should no longer be kept ""just in case"" someone happens to upload the same file. JK Rowling calls to tell you you're going to be the next Hollywood. You can if it's your own channel. This works in the same way as with groups and private chats. You can export everything that belongs to you. [deleted] You gotta pump those numbers up. Those are rookie numbers ;) Yes. To add on that, most of the ROM maintainers/groups want to keep track of the download counts of each ROM version which is not possible in Telegram. Also it is easier to organize in sourceforge or AFH. Happy Cake Day! Didn't know that. Thanks People can do this if they want, but who the fuck PAYS for porn???

Hence why I’m hoping if currently there is no option to ban a user even after they leave a group, at least Telegram may see this post and add this so much wanted feature. 

By the way, what do you mean by userbots? different than telgram bots as we know them? > By the way, what do you mean by userbots? different than telgram bots as we know them?

Since Telegram is open source and the API is there, anyone can make a script that operates a regular user's account. It could do everything that regular user can and even more. So they are probably joining to grab list of your users and then spam them. There's nothing you can do about it. I suppose for that to work they also need to develop their own telegram app, cos official telegram app only supports their own way of creating bots which are more restricted than normal users. right? It's not app dependent, it's a script running outside just like regular bots are running outside Telegram."

Secret chats are E2E-encrypted meaning your messages are solely being restricted to the devices of mutual participants when compared to normal chats that are stored on the cloud. Hence they issue a warning to let you know there is a 3rd party being involved when you use in-line commands.

[1] [That app literally has no plans for hiding your phone number](https://imgur.com/a/6nRYVPb) that obviously could be used to trace you by the same government that funded the app. 

In Telegram you can hide it and opt for usernames. You can set 2-step verification and many other things like making it impossible to contact your phone number by randomly typing numbers, just enabling a setting to be contacted only by the people you have in your contacts and other way more advanced than [2] the government funded toy.

[2] https://www.opentech.fund/results/supported-projects/open-whisper-systems/

People have to be objective... SIGNAL is USELESS compared to Telegram. Buy a prepaid number and sign up using that, set up an account password and then break the sim. If it gets re-issued later, nobody will gain access to your account since you have the password.

Just make sure you stay logged in to at least one device to retain access to it. I haven’t had any problems and is incripted Actually unbanned in Russia, they were so effective at getting around the Russian censorship the Russians just gave up.

They're actually targeting China and Iran now for their anti censorship tech :) >Telegram is secure in the sense no can access your data (at least without your permission)

lol no [https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/06/24/darknet-forum-leaks-telegram-database-with-millions-of-russian-users-information](https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/06/24/darknet-forum-leaks-telegram-database-with-millions-of-russian-users-information)

Use Signal or literally any other proper, always-end-to-end-encrypted app instead. Well, no. Remember, Telegram, (and thereby any country it operates out of,) can view your name, profile, and your messages in any non-secret chat. That's not true with Signal. Actually if your sim gets re-issued, the new owner will be able to trigger account removal, and you’ll get a notification informing you that your account will be deleted after 7 days, and you can’t do anything about it, if you choose to stop the deleting of your account it’ll ask you for a code that will get sent to the number as an SMS, so your only option to keep your account is to move it to another number. I get what you're trying to imply but don't promote any other app in this sub - you'd only get downvoted. Users here are hardcore TG fanboys. As the article mentions, they were able to scrape people by just adding random numbers to their phone books to have telegram sync their contacts and thus show them the ""correct"" numbers. This is pretty much useless to do now at you can simply choose to show your number to nobody. That leak was scrapped data; i.e. the user either had kept the data public or had (in a way) given permission to bots That's news to me, can you link me on where it's documented? As are moderators considering this thread is now removed, and me posting the link to Telegram as its own thread is hidden from view.

It's like /r/t_d all over again. Pathetic. That option is still disabled by default, and no user ever gets any kind of warning about the need to enable it. It wasn't advertised as a feature in any update log. It's therefore safe to assume 99% of protesters still have it enabled. This is why defaults matter. And Telegram is anything but secure by default. If they had enabled the setting by default, we wouldn't have this insane database. https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hdzogz/journalist_who_use_signal_and_telegram_for_safe/ Thanks!"

Now, is the community going to demand Durov to fix the issue by upgrading the security architecture so that it's on par with other apps like Signal, or will the community come up with excuses that move the goal posts?

Again: Insecure features, are not features, they are points of data leak with good UX."

Link preview of Instagram photos are not generating. The handle is public and the preview is generating on WhatsApp. Till yesterday link previews were generating fine but have stopped now.";2020-06-25 17:16:03;"It's intentional and it's on Instagram's side. The reason it's generating on WhatsApp is that both are Facebook products. Meanwhile, Instagram has already tried blocking Telegram links and stopping previews before, which lead to people calling them out and they stopped. Guess they learned nothing and decided to try again.

Sadly, right now we're all suffering from it while the platform decides whether it wants to play nice, lol. Maybe there's some proxy to work around it but it's probably easier to just wait. +1 on this, tried and also didn't work for posts. Linking to https://www.instagram.com worked.

Can't check on desktop right now. Maybe Instagram blocks Telegram crawlers that are running on Telegram data centers. It has started working again. This is so weird. the instagram previews doesnt work again It happens often with Private accounts of instagram, public account post's link's preview are easily generated. Try again, something seems to have been fixed. Started working for me. Rate limiting +1

Telegram is doing it really good - Next update, more stickers, everybody happy;0;hfmjde;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/8m4cbv0xa2751.jpg;10;[deleted];2020-06-25 16:57:25;"It's probably because you don't understand how this feature works. If you share a group with a person and you just posted something in that group - you will pop up as online, because... you are online, you just wrote a message, surprise. I guess that option only let you choose whether other people see exactly the time you were last online (15:28) or a general info (recently, last day, last week) When someone is not allowed to see your last seen/online status, you'll appear as ""online"" to them only if you do something that will obviously reveal you were online. That is, [these things described in the FAQ](https://telegram.org/faq#q-who-can-see-me-39online-39). Are you sure you didn't - for example - send a message in a group you share with this user? Welcome to Signal 😁 [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Because they ""saw"" you post something in shared group. It's obvious that you ARE online. As stated in the article I linked above, there are scenarios where your online status is revealed even if you have the privacy setting set to ""nobody"". Maybe one of the cases listed there happened and revealed your online status to that user? [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] think about it for a second. how are you able to join a group if you are not actively using the app? so by joining, that means you are online. it’s not rocket science. Ahah, ""I don't understand how the last seen settings work"" = telegram changed and doesn't give a shit about privacy anymore

First off, the privacy settings always worked like that. Hell, they received a couple of updates to make them even more configurable. If you think telegram was about privacy more than it was about usability and good UX, you really misunderstood it. Also, you are judging the ""privacy level"" of Telegram from the last seen privacy settings uh? From this point of view Telegram is way ahead of its competitors. We can argue about Telegram being ""secure"", which is not, because it is a cloud-based service (and **has always been** my dude, it's not something that changed during these 7 years) - but Telegram has some pretty on-spot privacy settings which has never received a ""downgrading"" update from the privacy point of view. And are not matched by any of its competitor (WhatsApp/Signal/Wire/WeChat/Messenger or any other IM aimed at the masses). The fact that many of the recent updates updates have focused on UX and quality of life stuff doesn't make Telegram any less private. You're just mad over nothing You mean the thread where:

a) the supposed journalist had their SIM cloned, which a regular hacker can't do;  
b) their account wasn't accessed and their messages were safe;  
c) they ignored all advice and said they didn't contact Telegram about this and ""would probably do it later"" despite saying it's an emergency;  
d) mentioned how amazing and wonderful Signal is every other comment.

That thread? The one that seems like Signal advertising or just someone making up a story for karma? Even if the cloned SIM story is true, it doesn't happen to regular people and it doesn't let anyone access your account if you have 2FA. [deleted] Out of your mind obviously. You've been given a simple explanation of how this feature works and why this happens by two people now, yet you're denouncing Telegram for being ""unsafe"" because you still can't understand what you're being told."

FaceTime is simply a worse version of modern messengers. Most pointless comment right here everybody. Yeeee, thank you!  I did that just now, and it let me in!  (taking forever to download as I speak though) \*sad android noises\* Thanks for the quick reply Probably, but still. I can't match that latency with two phones running duo on the same network. can you please recommend cool bots and stuff? xD Didn’t it always have video calls? I’m in Russia idk if it matters Nice [deleted] When installing over the AppStore version it says you may lose app data so just wondering if the reverse happens if you switch from beta back to the AppStore version? And what app data does it refer to? Tried it on my iPad and I did not lose any of the open chats so just curious Duo is probably server based. A good start and underrated is IFTTT bot, for instance you can connect a Spotify list and fetch when new song is added to your group. Or you can fetch news from RSSs from other sites. You can teach them how to use @pic, @gif, @wiki, @IMDB, @like, @vote. You can make quizes as well. No, it's had audio calls for a couple years but not video. 𝓷𝓲𝓬𝓮 ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)

If this is the upgrade they're planning for vocie calls, it could be huge. I tried Telegram calling with my friends several times.

Telegram for Windows: works well

Telegram for Android: sound quality is pretty poor, sometimes not usable.

We decided that we would stay with Skype when we need to talk. Most of the time the problems are related to interruptions, like a TV without signal. But the audio is pretty good. 

But yeah, it's not always good. Now that they are improving them, and also developing videocalls, I'll just be patient. 

Another great alternative is Google Duo. Nice interface, easy to use and the quality is amazing. It seems that this new Telegram video calls will be even better, but we'll see (I personally hope so). For me telegram calls work really good. After so many unreceived notifications to alert me and my family, who use Telegram, I've uninstalled it from all my devices and switched to WhatsApp. I've been getting by the notification problem by sending two texts, one after another, usually a smiley or something, because doing that often notifies the receiver of the first message, and they do likewise. But now the problem is even worse, and instead of hoping the next upgrade will solve the problem I've switched to a more reliable messenger. I have rarely used Telegram for calls but whenever I have used it I found the quality the same as WhatsApp's. Are you in a restrictive country/corporate network that might be forcing Telegram to relay calls via its server (if that's even something it can do)? I find calling on telegram way better than any other platform. Try Duo, works really well and is encryted. no sir the WhatsApp call is very good in quality it just connection issue that is bugging me on telegram"

I do TestFlight for other apps (namely Spotify and Waze) and I enjoy the experience of being on the cutting edge of apps to experiment with new features before they go public. *[ron paul it's happening gif]* How can I get that animated  cat sticker? 😮 What is about group calls ?

It's not surprising that's how it works for now. What it actually is... Is that it's being implement sooner than I expected. 

Mixed feelings. Haha. Make sure you're on the beta version. Nah look at the version in the video. 6.3
We only have 6.2.1 For now they're 1-1. It's like pre-alpha so let's be patient. The cat is part of the princess bubble gum pack.
I don't know about the sloth though Yes please I'd like them too! Which is not available to the public. You have to join Apple's TestFlight for the Telegram beta program which isn't always available, so pay attention:  https://testflight.apple.com/join/u6iogfd0 I haven't heard anything about it. But at least the last iOS beta version improved the videocalls UI and enabled the Picture in Picture. I feel like they will release video calls on all platforms next month It's whichever developer has time. The apps are developed by different people in telegram. [deleted] xD I guess because Apple takes longer times to process the updates or Pavel Durov likes Apple more, Telegram was also released for iOS first and then for the Android.

What's the ping address for telegram?;9;hecs6c;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hecs6c/whats_the_ping_address_for_telegram/;18;I want to ping telegram and check it's ping can someone share the IP or host address;2020-06-23 14:18:33;"[deleted] Telegram transfers are not the fastest to be honest anyway. But yeah. Not all servers responds to ICMP requests plus Telegram probably has a mega proxy to distribute the load. thanks well 
I'm using WiFi connection ""ping telegram.com"" 

Thanks to the magic of DNS, it'll spit out the IP. Anyone got an IP range? On what OS?

In Windows you should be able to use netstat to get the IPs currently used by Telegram.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netstat

But as others replied, it doesn't matter if the servers is set to not respond to ping. Yes I did but nothing is coming back just request time out But I can ping google.com YouTube.com twitter.com 
Everything is ok
Except Reddit and Telegram Right, because the servers telegram.org is hosted on do not reply to ICMP echo requests for one reason or another. That doesn't necessarily mean they are not online, or that there is some problem. Thanks for your answer
But I'm seriously getting slow speed for downloading anything, from telegram That's a different issue. The servers hosting telegram.org and the servers you actually connect to when using the app are generally different, and files can also be in different data centers I believe. I'm not sure if there's anything you can do about slow downloads. Are you by any chance using Telegram X? That app sometimes downloads slower than the others for me. If you have a computer connected to an ethernet cable you could get faster downloads using telegram desktop. I did personally get way faster downloads using telegram desktop. yes you are right
the downloads are slower in telegramx since morning what about the other app 
telegram? I use Plus Messenger. Look that up on the playstore yes i know that app  
the downloads are fine? I'm not downloading anything. Tell you something, you download the app, try the downloads and find out if the speed is better for you. Alright? thanks"

Journalist who use Signal and Telegram for safe communication got his Telegram hacked, despite having 2FA activated and account set for deletion;154;hdzogz;Telegram;/r/privacy/comments/hdv38j/i_work_as_a_journalist_in_a_third_world_country/;37;;2020-06-22 23:04:26;"Hi,

in point 9, you're confusing thing. In Telegram nobody can have access to the account w/o have both SMS and 2FA password.

But who have access to SMS, can request an account restore (deletion). This is for a reason: mobile carriers, worldwide, are usual to re-assign past number to new customers for new contracts, so Telegram needs to give an operational and decisional privilege to the SMS receiver.

And since you said ""Within minutes, for no reason, I lose all cell signal"", I think that your SIM (NO Telegram account) has been hacked. As you realised in point 10.

About your affirmation of 12th point: 2FA protected you from external account access. I'd not say it's useless, at all. If your SIM has been hacked, it's not Telegram affair and it cannot help you in this at all, as any other external service can't, but your mobile carrier, if you trust them.

As additional info: you can save your account if you MIGRATE the current account to another mobile. This will pair a new mobile to the current account, and the deletion procedure will be stopped. The ""design flaw"" is just that telegram is completely linked to a phone number, this is, the account's owner is the phone number's owner. The problem is that SIM's can be hacked, it is inherently NOT safe in any mean... so yeah, but hey, you have to know that it would be SO MUCH WORSE if your data was exposed, but that won't happen thanks to 2FA. But yeah, telegram should start thinking about removing the forced link between phone number and telegram account.

Anyway, in your situation i wouldnt use a service like telegram just because i would always, always assume the phone signal is always and constantly hacked and being listened, thats how you should always think as a journalist, and so you should be using signal only, and maybe if you must use telegram for something you could have a server in some much more secure country which forwards messages between signal and telegram, i dont know Would telegram ever support Authy? Phone numbers just not secure and should not be any part of a good mfa chain, imho Never ever use SMS 2FA. It is flawed. Consider something like Appy, back up all your data to a trustworthy cloud (you could even host your own cloud and white list your IP w/ a password). 

As stated above this is simply your phone carrier. You can set additional protection by setting up a recovery email and a passphrase which I have done. This is not good indeed. I hope Telegram does something about this.   


Many rely on Telegram being a safe way to communicate. [deleted] >And since you said ""Within minutes, for no reason, I lose all cell signal"", I think that your SIM (NO Telegram account) has been hacked.

Please stop binding accounts to phone numbers. Use an email address instead. Users can use something secure as Proton mail. And telegram can provide an app based 2fa which users can use with andOTP or the like.

It is EXTREMELY easy for governments to perform SIM swap fraud esp in countries where telcos are still owned by the government. [deleted] >  This is for a reason: mobile carriers, worldwide, are usual to re-assign past number to new customers for new contracts, so Telegram needs to give an operational and decisional privilege to the SMS receiver.

Telegram account self-destructs if there's no activity for 6 months (or 1 year). It takes at least 6 months for the number to get re-assigned to new customers. So, while this feature helps people who got the number re-assigned, what's the point in getting their account reset in 7 days? I never realized that was the ""design flaw"", but I did find it weird that an app which publicizes privacy so much forces you to link your Telegram account to a phone number. Governments can EASILY perform the SIM swap fraud (esp in countries where telcos are still not privatized). 

High time Telegram stopped relying on the mobile number. Instead they can use email (and we could use something like Proton mail) to bind the accounts with app based 2fa. You seem to misunderstand this. In case of Telegram, SMS isn't the second factor, it's the first factor. The password is optional, not SMS. (Yes, it's true, they got it completely backwards)

It would help a lot if they stopped requiring a phone number, I agree with that. What Telegram should do in your opinion? Please read [my reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hdzogz/journalist_who_use_signal_and_telegram_for_safe/fvo8sex/) first From this thread, one thing appears to be not secure, clearly: the involved mobile carrier.  
Literally nothing, in this post, describes Telegram as not secure, at all. There are some mistakes in what the thread creator has written, crucial ones.  
Please read [my main reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hdzogz/journalist_who_use_signal_and_telegram_for_safe/fvo8sex/). [deleted] [deleted] I just signed up, and had t give a phone number, there was no option for email. /u/wizard86pz is on the right track: Telegram allows for an account to be deleted without the password, because otherwise (like with Signal) an account could be squatted on forever and prevent someone from signing up for the app, which isn’t exactly a fair way of handling things. As such, they put in the one-week deletion timer which gives the account owner a lot of time to set things right. And at no point is anyone’s privacy compromised, because the 2FA password can’t be bypassed. The person logging in *must* know it in order to see any of the account’s details. I understand that your case is quite exceptional and frustrating, but as long as you can get a VoIP number or any sort of secondary phone number within the week, you can change the number on your account and everything will be back to normal. 

As someone pointed out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hdv38j/i_work_as_a_journalist_in_a_third_world_country/fvol7pz/), you can also export your current chat history and account details from the Desktop client, to make sure your research isn’t completely wiped away. > In my opinion, getting another number and migrating to it might not be a valid solution for people like me

Is a burner number not an option here? You don't even need to purchase a phone, you can use an app like TextNow or 2ndLine to get a hold of a burner number, migrate the account, and then if you don't want to keep the burner number active, migrate back. I see your point, it's about what to preserve.

Imagine a user that has a mobile used in Telegram and Signal.

After 1 year of mobile inactivity (for example) the mobile carrier re-assign the number to a new customer, this happens frequently.

In this scenario, the new customer will never have the possibility to use his number with Signal, while he will be able to request an account resetting (deletion) if his new number has been used in past for an already existing account on Telegram.

Again, I see your point, but it's about a choice of service. And, again, Telegram continues to be secure, since NOBODY will access to the account without both SMS code and 2FA password. Hi I understand your frustrations your options for alternatives are Threema and Briar (Android only) ,Jami.net which doesn't depend on any of mobile , E - mail, 

Matrix riot.im is also there but it uses email.

Hope this helps This is an edge use case and telegram while it can be used at this level of threat model, isn't intended to be. Using a desktop client to download and save chats to an encrypted cloud would be more robust.

The 7 day is pretty simple. Think of a common scenario. Person installs telegram on their phone but is a casual user and doesn't change it when they get a new phone. Instead just signs up for a new account on the new number because old phone was lost etc. Phone providers recycle numbers more and more rapidly these days. I get a new plan and Sim with a new provider, my friends use telegram but to combat bots and fraud I need a number, so I use my new number. Turns out there is an account associated with it.

Your suggestion is that I need to wait a year before using it? When it automatically deletes?

Or I send a delete request and in 7 days I can start using it. Now if that old account was still active they ll be like, woops forgot to change account number, and do it. Only in the state actor level scenario where they can suppress your ability to sign up for a Sim because it gives away your location is this an issue.

Something then like signal or session, etc is probably a better bet.
And in the end telegram didn't compromise him, he going to take a loss on convos and cloud backups because of his data backup practices, which sucks but not really a failure you can pin on telegram. If you expect this level of duress you really should map out scenarios and model how your tools will adapt or be compromised. Hijacking a sim card doesn't mean, at all, accesing your data, as the OP has experienced.

Telegram has never been really private as always has been linked to a phone number, what it has always said is it is secure, which is different than private. They try to make it as much private as possible, but always linked to a phone number. They have always defended the convenience of WhatsApp, this is, you have someone in your address book, install telegram and there you go, you can contact him Oh yeah you're right of course. 

So you login with your phone number where an SMS is sent, and then *if you want it* you can set up a 2FA password? Request account deletion with SMS, halt deletion with 2FA password Then session is better, as it is based on singal protocol but doesnt require any phone number (or anything else) That is true... Yeah they force phone number usage. I wish they didn't. Phone numbers are so easy to hack. Exactly. This is due another thing too I'd say: there are more cases of mobile recycling than SIM-swiping. So, due to this type of approach, Telegram will cause less problem in a population of users. But in Signal is not permanent. I think google voice also allows free mobile phone numbers, you will only have to receive the SMS there telegram tries too hard to prevent signups from virtual phone numbers, unfortunately. [deleted] Yes, that's how Telegram works. (so, it's a bit worse than ""regular"" SMS 2FA) Wouldn't this allow someone to continue using a number long after it has been recycled? Which also causes a problem if they happen to get logged out if their last device with Telegram and have no means to receive a login code (which has happened in the past when users have been forcefully logged out due to server-side issues). I haven't had any problems with a Google voice number. 

Which is good because my GV is my primary contact. > telegram tries too hard to prevent signups from virtual phone numbers, unfortunately.

It really, really doesn't though. I use app generated burner numbers *all* the time for alt accounts. It's never once failed. 2FA password protects you ONLY from Telegram account access, not from account recovery/destroy, as explained. That's why I still assume Telegram as secure. The account deletion is just a SIM-Swipe fraud consequence. I just added 2FA but know I don't know what to think, I personnaly think it's better to set this up to have more protection even though it has some flaws (added new password + email) my experience was different, but I'll try the apps you suggested in the previous comment some day. thank you for the info! [deleted] Got you. Sorry of this. You need a new mobile, rapidly, to maintain the account. Even if it can re-occur, it's the only one way."

I am seeing articles that claim the lift on the ban is the result of Durov agreeing to provide info to gov. 

This ZdNet article, for example.

Is there any substance to this claim or are they just trying to save face? Yes but telegram would be accessible becouse russian government tried and failed. Untill finall they gave up. So i think same applies to china as well.also telegram has more features than whatsapp. Thank you so much, this guy is amazing! Subscribed to the channel! I was close with a woman who once consumed nothing but water and lemon juice for a month, out of choice. I don't know how they do it. She's a biologist, and extremely smart, so I trusted her judgement even though I was extremely worried. I respect and idolize such craziness probably a bit of both.

Since the SEC robbed Telegram of its ICO.. I guess Durov is in need of a new strategy.
And there is a lot of face saving since the ban was a failure."

When will the security of normal chats and channels be improved?;66;hcmrje;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hcmrje/when_will_the_security_of_normal_chats_and/;76;"Nobody denies that what Telegram always adds is good, the folders, stickers, etc., but the mark of Telegram is privacy, why only the secret chat has a good encryption?, I have several channels where I upload files that I do not want in my PC, I have started to investigate and although it is not easy for someone to access my files, it is not impossible for a genius and/or government.

I think that if they boast so much about privacy, well they should show it, I don't feel so safe using the app anymore.

**Lots of stickers, lots of nice features, and privacy, security?**";2020-06-20 17:02:15;"Well. Let's make something clear. Security is something different from privacy. That said, if you want to archive something, you're probably not secure even if you archive it on an offline disk, and then you connect the disk to a PC.   


Unfortunately, I'm not aware of a way to have E2EE with all those server based features, and I believe Telegram's solutions is ok ( you get features and you get security).  


Take Signal for example. Maybe more secure for the average user (since chats are E2EE by default). But when it comes to features and actual usage, it's like using an abacus while are your friends are using a 16-digits calculator.  


A part from that, privacy is something totally different in my opinion. You could use the most secure system in the world, but if you make your content public.. Well.. Not really system's issue. [deleted] They still have Client-to-server encryption for regular chats. It’s not like it’s passing raw data 
>mark of Telegram is privacy

No it's not. It never was.

If you care about privacy, you shouldn't use TG in the first place. Use Signal instead.

E2EE can't be used on normal chats, because then you'll lose the cloud functionality. Your chats and data is stored on TG servers, E2EE will break that. Cloud storage gives rise to the best features of TG; encryption will limit those. I would like to see some device linking feature in secret chats, since the devices are stored in telegram.. on multiple devices the secret chat feature lacks the quality of live to have it on multiple devices... Like wire or signal does.

In addition the account reset should be changed .. someone with a cloned sim can delete your account and workaround that 2fa because the reset confirmation is send via SMS.... Why don't you use mega.nz or something for file storage? I think there should be a setting to default the message to secret message right away instead of normal chat.

In HK there already many case where the police hack protesters phone and get both party chat record, also channel record too Telegram's secret chats have end to end encryption. You got a point, thanks man. I'm doing that, thanks btw. I wonder how signal does that, while preserving the sweet sync. Then why does Telegram advertise it as first item on it's front page?

>Private  
>  
>**Telegram** messages are heavily encrypted and can self-destruct.

Telegram has been fooling users to think it's a private option since day one.

>Use Signal instead.

Agreed. Does Signal require phone number to use? If yes, then Signal is like Telegram, but much worse in terms of features and no real advantages in terms of privacy Well, at first it was. I think they're more concerned in give us more stickers than improve some security and/or privacy aspects. True, he wants privacy and that no one accedes his files but it’s on a public channel and plataform as Telegram, that’s contradictory 🤦🏻‍♂️ That's why Signal is getting more attention these days. [deleted] Not available on desktop though. [deleted] Finally, someone who understands! Yes, signal requires the phone number and, even worse, once you are in a chat it shares your number to all the partecipants! I was forced to use it for business because of the Covid and teleworking, and now every colleague has my phone number, also if I didn’t want. For me: epic privacy fail. If I’m wrong please someone tell me how to hide my phone number in signal... I’ll appreciate I'm sorry - IDK if you're serious or not. But Signal is the best in terms of privacy. It's encryption is independently audited. 


>Does Signal require phone number to use?

Yes it does. But you're confusing privacy with anonymity.

https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/ If you want security within telegram you can use secret chats. Only those have end to end encryption. Yeah, and this really sucks... E2EE groups would be nice... Just for up to 50ppl or whatever.. and so on... There are multiple things they could improve. Having every message in plaintext on the server isn't really nice... Like this is the whole point of r/megalinks (oops I guess they banned it)
The files are stored encrypted in the cloud, the sever doesn't even have the keys Nope, personal ""private"" channel, I'm not an idiot. And I don't use Mega because it is slow af, at least in my country, plus the bandwidth limit. What's up with all the downvotes here? Nobody's linking anything and just saying whatever they feel like ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ There is not point of making end to end chat as cloud backed up. Since they just lie between two different devices. Are you on windows? A third party app called Unigram can help. That's a false dichotomy, you can upload messages passed over E2EE data to server, protected with client side encryption. Privacy is not anonymity. You wanna be anonymous use Session. Signal doesnt share your number with randos. It's only visible to contacts that are in your phone who use signal, and the folks who have you as a contact on their phone.

WhatsApp and telegram are the other two apps who do the same, that I can think of right now. \>  But Signal is the best in terms of privacy. 

Serious statement. I guess it's just your own opinion. Signal provides only ""secret"" chats while Telegram provides both Secret Chats (not worse than Signal's) and Cloud chats with awesome features.

I'm not confusing anything. Both Telegram and Signal are about privacy, not anonymity and between these two, Telegram is the obvious winner One more thing: I tell everyone to avoid using Signal since it's a complete bullshit. Why? Because its founder, Moxie Marlinspike, can't be trusted.

[https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/](https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/)

He said that ""Signal's OpenWhisper protocol is implemented in WhatsApp"", but in reality it quite differes from OW. First, WhatsApp allows key change for offline messages which is already quite fishy. Second, WhatsApp allows unencrypted backups to Google/Apple clouds which is unacceptable.

So if Moxie says that WhatsApp's encryption is good, then I have all right to think that Signal's encryption is as bad as WhatsApp's. So, no trust to Moxie, no trust to Signal. No secret chats on desktop, so... useless. Agreed. There's already a distinction between normal group and super group. Supergroup's don't need E2EE because if you have hundreds of users in a group the chances are the messages won't be very private anyway. Normal group chats should be E2EE. It's OK to warn the group admin that upgrading to larger group will disable E2EE, and then make sure every group member sees a notification about it. This is a problem that can be solved.

It's just the developer's lack the know-how on how to deploy proper E2EE. I get that it's hard, but it's something most vendors have already done, e.g. Signal, Riot, Keybase, and OMEMO and OTR developers have already done most of the hard lifting. It feels like Durov boys are making this a Russian-math-talent-vs-the-western-world, there's no shame in adopting Signal protocol, just like there was no shame in copying the UI of WhatsApp ;) But what OP is asking for is E2EE for items they're archiving to a channel. Lolno. Arch Linux on my desktop, Ubuntu on my file server. 😎 I’ve just discovered Session, thank you very much! It looks very promising vuyvuyviiviu I’m sorry, that’s not correct. I can see phone numbers of my colleagues, I swear I don’t have them in my phone book! I really want to not to show my phone number, it was impossible! Telegram offers you the privacy of not having to share your phone number with the people you are messaging.

It should be noted, however, that unlike Telegram, Signal is designed such that its servers cannot see your social graph nor your profile. In that sense, it offers marginally more privacy than Telegram's secret chats. In terms of being awesome - TG is the winner, no doubts here. TG's good, really good - I use it everyday. 

But in terms of privacy - TG doesn't have a chance against Signal. Because secret chats are not enabled by default. Regular user might not even know that the normal chats are not encrypted (they're encrypted but not E2E). But when a user switches to Signal - he knows what he's getting. E2EE on all chats. 

Signal's encryption has been independently audited. I don't know if you know but that's a really good sign in terms of privacy : https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1013.pdf That's a foolish line of reasoning. Signal is fully open-source and independently audited. Like Telegram, you can compile your client from source so you know what code you are running.

You don't have to inherently trust Moxie to trust Signal's encryption practices. Thus, you not trusting Moxie doesn't mean Signal is bs. It's encryption is independently audited. IDK what you're going on about.

https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1013.pdf

Are you choosing to ignore stuff? I feel like you're saying TG's Homebrew Encryption is better than Signal's? There's no comparison between Signal and TG in terms of privacy. >Second, WhatsApp allows unencrypted backups to Google/Apple clouds which is unacceptable.  
>  
>Which is what Telegram does for default for all chats, just instead of having untrusted party that's Google, it's the untrusted party that's Telegram. If not because Telegram is selling that data in secret, because they obviously [can't keep it safe](https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/06/24/darknet-forum-leaks-telegram-database-with-millions-of-russian-users-information). This. When you sit in front of your computer, you don't want to whip out your phone three times a minute, unlock it and open telegram just to reply via secret  chat.

Also, group chats don't support E2EE on any client. It's not possible E2E is for only the content flowing in between two devices once delivered there won't be any further encryption from the service provider end. If Op want to put encryption on everything he better protect it by password. 
Second people think E2E as some kind of magic which can protect them from people snooping over their content which is completely false, Whatsapp is end to end encrypted and still your local policeman can print the entire chat history of literally any registered complaint. 
Telegram gives you that power that they don't store anything on their server from Secret Chat so there won't be anything to disclose. Yes how did you know? Thats super odd. I got the android app. Shows me just my contacts. Try sending a tweet their way. I doubt so. What is more dangerous?
1) Some unknown server in another country knows your phone number? 2) Some stalker in your local chat sees your phone number, because Signal allows him to see it? It's the million's time I read ""secret chats in Telegram are not enabled by default"". Please stop, that's just wrong. Open Telegram for Android, go to menu. What so you see? ""New group"", ""New secret chat"", ""New channel"". 
It's ONE tap from you. 

Yeah, I don't have to trust Moxie right now, but since such person ""leads"" Signal, this app is dangerous to use, any small change the in code and Signal becomes vulnerable for third party. TG's homebrew encryption is at least as strong as Signal's, maybe even better. If Tg's MTProto was bad, there would already have been public exploits and security researches. I'm sure Moxie or other people would gladly ""crack"" MTProto to get money and popularity. However, that's not the case for now. I know about that incident. It's bad, yeah, but it's something which already happened in 2015, because Telegram is about privacy, not anonymity.
If Alice gets her phone number leaked, no one would be able to see what she is messaging.

Telegram is not untrusted, WhatsApp is. It is possible. Riot/Matrix has E2EE and multiple device support. They sync your keys between your devices. iOS Signal group members (my colleagues) phone numbers [here](https://postimg.cc/D8pf1g9N) ready to be spammed!!!! It means that every group member has now my phone number Depends on your use case.

On Signal, if you are only talking to people you know, then your number won't be shared with anyone who doesn't have your number already UNLESS someone who has your number shares it. Then the second case is not an issue.

If you are engaging in large groups with people you may not know/trust, Telegram would probably be better for that.

However, for sensitive or truly private communication, the first case is a bigger issue. You have to be able to bindly trust the government of that country and the employees that have access to and maintain the server.

The great thing is, though, that these apps aren't mutually exclusive 🙂. Signal is getting usernames. Your argument is invalid. E2EE matters more than no E2EE, Telegram loses because Telegram isn't getting E2EE for groups. You're thick. On my Desktop Telegram for Linux right now, where's that secret chat button?

I'm trying to enable it for group chats on my Android client. Where's that secret group chat button? A few things to consider then:

Moxie talked of adding the Signal Protocol to WhatsApp. The Signal Protocol is a cryptographic protocol, meaning that things like backups are outside the scope of the protocol. I don't know what you mean by key change for offline messages, but I believe you are notified about key changes.

Moxie's operation has always been fully open source. He helped Facebook and Apple out of a desire to spread accessibility to E2EE to more people, not because he thought those services were a model of how private messaging should be run.

Small changes in code that introduce vulnerabilities is a risk for all messaging apps. All software really. And nothing you've said would suggest Moxie specifically would intentionally introduce security or privacy vulnerabilities to his own app.

If it's a matter of trust, with Signal, you can compile your own client so you have the peace of mind everything being sent out is encrypted the way you expect. With Telegram, for example, you have to trust closed-source server code to be secure and trust *everyone* who has elevated access to those servers, as those people can read your not-secret-chat messages and profiles. Lol, cracking contests tell absolutely nothing about the security of cryptography. This has been known for 22 years [https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1998/1215.html#contests](https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1998/1215.html#contests)

Telegram developers proved this by not being able to break their own challenge with completely broken and backdoored primitives: [https://hackerfall.com/story/a-crypto-challenge-for-the-telegram-developers-1](https://hackerfall.com/story/a-crypto-challenge-for-the-telegram-developers-1)

This proves the competition was rigged. Where does the 2015 come from?

Also anonymity is subset of privacy over metadata. It's OK to not be metadata-private, but privacy of content via E2EE matters **a lot.** 

>Telegram is not untrusted

The fact you have to trust Telegram not to read your group chats is a failure in security design. I believe that if you accept a chat with someone on Signal, your phone number and profile is shared with other participants.

I think that Signal implements group messaging in a way that if you send a message to the group, the message is encrypted and sent separately to each member. That's why it needs the contact information of each participant. The client apps than put it in the group chat window you see on your device. This allows E2EE in group chats, something I don't believe is available on Telegram. Desktops are insecure. Period. With Signal you only have one option: ""secret chats"". With Telegram, you have 2 options: ""Cloud chats"" with extra features and ""secret chats"" like Signal.

And yeah, I just don't trust Moxie completely. Do it yourself then. >Where does the 2015 come from?

I remember phone numbers leak as far as of 2015. Maybe even earlier (using Telegram since December 2013)

> The fact you have to trust Telegram not to read your group chats 

I'm completely ok with the fact that Telegram is reading my group chats while it's ONLY Telegram (their software, not their staff) who can do that. I personally trust Telegram in some cases and when I really need to tell something confidential (some medic or bank things), I use Secret Chats which cannot be read even by Telegram staff. Then why is Telegram offering secret chats on Mac desktops?

Also how are you quantifying that?

Smartphones are also insecure because of short vendor support [http://www.androidvulnerabilities.org/graph](http://www.androidvulnerabilities.org/graph)

And again, why don't non-super-groups have E2EE? It's up for the Durov bois to show their competition is valid, it's not my job lol. I can just declare them losers for trying something that was known to be bullshit 22 years ago. Unlike them, I do my best to read and follow best practices with my code. >while it's ONLY Telegram (their software, not their staff) who can do that.

So your security model is from this book [https://boyter.org/static/books/Cp03W2QWAAAMuMK.jpg](https://boyter.org/static/books/Cp03W2QWAAAMuMK.jpg)

Ok, just don't expect anyone else on Reddit to share your non-existent threat model of privileged person in a stable country.

>I use Secret Chats which cannot be read even by Telegram staff.

Can you see the problem with giving Telegram metadata about with whom you have secret conversations with? How much you have them? When you have them? How much secret data passes through it? Can you then see  the benefit in using E2EE for everything by default?

Also, how are you using Secret Chats on desktop?

How do you think e.g. activists or journalists can have private group chats if its not possible at all? Because macOS is more secure than Windows. And since TDesktop (cross-platform) uses the same code for all 3 platforms, it cannot have ""secure"" secret chats.

macOS version (the native one) is macOS-specific. > It's up for the Durov bois to show their competition is valid 

Feel free to study [protocol](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) and prove its failures. From Telegram clients source code you can prove that key generation and both client-client and client-server encryption is strong against MiTM. You can also check that Google Play / AppStore builds are built from exactly the same source code (reproducible builds).

> I can just declare them losers for trying something that was known to be bullshit 22 years ago 

Yeah, another hater. But macOS is proprietary, and Apple is an NSA PRISM partner. Surely you know this. You can't trust the OS just like you can't trust WhatsApp.

My point: You're contradicting your own threat model. I'm not really into people who can't keep their story straight, let's try to avoid each other from now on.

Also, there's nothing that prevents cross-platform app from using E2EE, that's just the question of cross platform libraries and implementation. >Feel free to study [protocol](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) and prove its failures.

No they set up the competition to prove their point, it's up to them to show it works, and clearly you're not someone reading the articles so you're either a shill or someone who'd rather have blind faith in a company than the entire academic cryptographic community. Telegram is a laughing stock among them, why do you think that's the case?

>From Telegram clients source code you can prove that key generation and  both client-client and client-server encryption is strong against MiTM.

Hehe. From MTPRoto 1.0 you can see Durov succumbed to nepotism and hired his brother (who's a not a cryptographer but a geometrician) to develop a home-brew stew of IND-CCA insecure AES-IGE, and expired primitives like SHA-1 which deviates from best practices to incredible extent. That alone showed they're not suited to rigorous academic effort like protocol design. They didn't even read the existing literature. Just like you; even when presented with an article that showed the cracking contests have been used as flawed demonstration of security for a generation, you still insist on your fanboyism. I understand the cognitive dissonance must be insane but if it helps at all, I also thought Telegram was a really secure app back in 2013 when it came out. Then as I learned more about crypto I started to realize how wrong I'd been. It's OK to be wrong, just learn from your mistakes.

The use of the cryptographic contest also proved Telegram didn't want to go the academic way (i.e. formal proofs of correctness of the protocol under the assumptions of security of primitives) like professional cryptographers, they went the snake oil way and said ""it's secure, prove us wrong"". Well, no academic can do that, but that doesn't mean the NSA can't. And it's not like the NSA's gonna pull out their dick and scream ""OI WE CAN DO IT SCREW YOU DUROV"", or what do you reckon? This is another proof that they don't know what the fuck they are doing.

Thirdly, it's this endless debate over whether or not MTProto 2.0 E2EE is secure or not. Sure, let's assume it is. You create a group conversation, is MTProto 2.0 E2EE used? No. It fucking isn't. Telegram is using MTProto 2.0 Cloud encryption for its group chats on every platform, and that can be verified from the source code also. The group chat's aren't using the great MITM-free encryption, therefore Telegram loses it's own crypto challenge:

1. Be server or hack it
2. Read group messages

Does the crypto challenge allow anyone to try to hack Telegram server? It fucking doesn't. So we can conclude it's rigged in that aspect too. So yeah, no.

&#x200B;

>Yeah, another hater.

Sure, I hate the fact people endanger the community by recommending insecure apps like Telegram. So yeah, I hate the lies you're spreading. I do not hate you however, unless you're doing it intentionally."

I mean... Snow bend the knee I love Telegram as a service, but it is not secure at all. It uses a proprietary encryption algorithm instead of Signal's (which is open source and the golden standard). And they store your messages on their server with the decryption key ""for convenience"", which is like locking the door to your house and keeping the key in the lock. 

If they switched to Signal's encryption (like Google Duo and WhatsApp) and stopped storing so much user data, I'd have an easier time trusting that they cannot hand my data over (because they literally would be unable to). Instead they promise they won't. They claim that you can't access your chats from multiple devices if they E2EE everything, but that's bullshit because Signal on my desktop works with my phone off. Lol ur cute, Pavel Durov constantly discusses vulnerabilities in WhatsApp. Expecting him to advocate for and implement something of WhatsApp’s, which he deems as wrong, is goofy sir, use another app if you don’t like telegram \_(0,0)_/. (I get that you may be forced to use this app tho and if so, sorry bud) It's difficult to claim that a mass-market message app is ""secure"". And more with the intended approach of Signal. 

Yes... Most probably messages are secure, but the idea behind is kind of weird. Why would the same government, trying to crack and put backdoors on apps, [support financially](https://www.opentech.fund/project/open-whisper-systems) something that basically will make such thing EVEN MORE difficult? 

It's like the Russian government gave to the people against them a tool to make their messages secure, so then they could prepare themselves against that government. Will you trust that? 

What would have sense is if the government took the technology and the make it only available for them to communicate securely and not being spied by other governments. 

But then they helped a project to make their fears bigger? Like literally impossible to get information. 

Knowing the niche nature of Signal, that means that a very few people will actually use it. And the government can't see your messages, but you have a phone number well known by them! So then you can be a target, you are basically setting an alarm that they should put more attention on you: what this guy's hiding? 

Matrix, Riot or Status which don't need a phone number to use can be considered more secure. 

So then all of this is all about TRUST. You have to TRUST Telegram that they're not sneaking intro your cloud messages. You have to TRUST Signal that they're not basically making a way to allow the government to set more attention on their users. 

Telegram is my main messaging app... But I know the things that could be going on. More than that fear of being spied is just HOW ACTUALLY useful it is compared to Signal which vision is not shared by the needs of most people, I mean, more than just ""privacy"". Telegram it's right now the best messaging app ever made to date. 

*And how could I trust founders who doesn't even show their identities?*

Durov said in an article that he and his brother really considered using Signal's protocol. But they had their  rights to doubt something like that ☝️🏻 (something promoted by the government). WhatsApp didn't great the Signal protocol. Signal did. It's used and vetted by Edward Snowden as well as several members of the cryptographic community. WhatsApp merely adopted it, by choice. 

Meanwhile, MTProto was written by Durov's brother, who is a mathematician and not a cryptographer. 

Telegram is great as an app, as I said. But it's not as secure as they pretend it is. It should not be relied on for sensitive conversations, especially when your messages are decrypted on their servers and stored there with the decryption key. I mean, how much more careless can you be with your security?

I don't understand why you trust Durov so much. The entire Signal protocol is open source, has been analyzed several times, and hasn't been found to contain any major flaws. Durov claims there are backdoors in the protocol, but has yet to list any (which doesn't even make sense when the protocol's code is entirely open and readable). I don't totally disagree with what you've said, but Signal's protocol is entirely open source (as well as the client and server). Telegram's server isn't, and the official client source code is only released way after the client is actually released. And at the end of the day, I would trust an actual, technical inability to read messages (end to end encryption by default) over a simple promise not to read unencrypted messages."

Good Job Durov ! go ahead on. I hope that doesn't mean Telegram ceded information to Russia... Durov is a modern hero! Telegram should be unblocked everywhere
and Telegram devs need to work on TelegramX too.
I see no updates from them so they finally got the keys I mean, it technically was blocked, but it worked just fine Brilliant I like it. Viva Russia!! Way to go Russia. its your turn maam I hope China will be the next. Such sad news. It seems that we (Russians) today have lost the last hope that Telegram will not leak our data to the investigative committee. Although it was somewhat naive to rely on this earlier, we had reason to believe in this beautiful fairy tale.   


>!Et tu, Pavel? Пожалуй это одна из самых печальных новостей о Телеге за последнее время.!< They probably thought: better to eavesdrop on the regular Telegram chats, maybe not the secure ones, than get nothing at all. 

   OR - they finally have their FSB/SVR Assets in place at Telegram and now wish everyone a happy time communicating 

  OR they just found another way to spy on t.communications.

  OR Telegram had a Security Audit by Eugene Kaspersky, Alumni of KGB School of Cryptography.
Kaspersky is one of the best really - if you don’t mind close ties to FSB and the Kreml. 

Either way. They figured its more to their advantage to let the bit flow ... I agree Yes if it is true then telegram users from russian region will access telegram more easily than before. I doubt it. Russian government has no leverage over Telegram. They were probably asked to stop trying to block it by other agencies that want to use it legally since they were unable to block it anyway for years and just disrupted other internet services. TelegramX is a different project not made by the main team [deleted] LOL. 
Don't think the rest got it Lol What are you basing this on? Talks of this happening started when it was revealed that Russian politicians were using Telegram and relied on its bots and groups to communicate. It'd be silly of them to keep the app blocked yet use it, no point in that.

There's no way a guy who was run out of the country is just going to turn around and go ""yeah, let's be friends instead"". It wasn't hard tho I can agree that it's happened here as a Russian user, but before it wasn't too difficult due to official proxy, though Main meme here is that some government structures were using it, had their channels and so on. Even when it was officially ""blocked"". Fucking shitshow. then who's the developer https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x yes i know not official app but it is part of telegram.   
it's more better than official client \> What are you basing this on?

Nothing. Telegram is widely used by government agencies and regional authorities in Russia. It is the go to messenger for Russian officials. Really there was no point to continue blocking it and it looked like a farce and a shit show, where an officially blocked messenger was officially used by the government to keep the population informed on COVID-19. This act just reflects reality on the ground. \> It'd be silly of them to keep the app blocked yet use it, no point in that.They used it when it was blocked. Do you think that they are so stupid that they can not get around the ""basic block by IP""? The legend that Durov was kicked out is beautiful (by the way no one drove him out, he left the country when he received a share from the sale of VK), but the truth is unknown to anyone. There is in the Russian community existing interesting version that it was initially a project of Russian special services... but I am very sceptical about this.

>Source: [Roskomnadzor](https://rkn.gov.ru/news/rsoc/news73050.htm)Готовы взаимодействовать со всеми интернет-компаниями, работающими на территории страны, для оперативного пресечения распространения террористической и экстремистской информации, детской порнографии, пропаганды суицида и наркотиков.

It's just that it very clearly shows the value of words - not a byte to third parties. Or does someone think that cooperation will occur without leaking personal data? I do not accept liberal values but regretfully agrees that in our country of extremism this is a great occasion to shut up anyone for anything. Hahah Yes I totally agree with you, that's why I love Telegram Excuse me, which ones are the official proxies? For the life of me, I'm unable to find them online... No. Telegram x was an esperimentato version of telegram but now telegram Is more efficent They used it because they found it convenient, unblocking makes it even more convenient to use, that's it. Spreading conspiracy theories as gospel and saying that ""guy leaves country after FSB asks for decryption keys"" is a legend is a bit mixed up. They sent us a message with a link. We all understand very well why they use it. The reason is the same as we use - it merely does not have alternatives in many aspects. Many of those who do not use VPN or proxies also did not encounter any problems accessing the service. Probably a ""more convenient use"" is not without meaning. This one is a feeble reason.  
\> Spreading conspiracy theories as gospel and saying that ...Common dude. Look at the dates. He left the country long before Telegram appeared in the public domain. Alright, maybe he left for other reasons. That doesn't reinforce the weird conspiracy theory that the app is a ""secret services"" project. The same could be said about any messaging app then and it's not a good road to go down. He left because of repressions due to him owning VK at that time. Afterwards he developed Telegram with the aim of guaranteeing a safe way of communication. So yes, the dates are no coincidence. Telegram was the result of be repressed. To be honest, I heard this in the circles of people who still use Jabber and Tox. :)    
But given how morally obsolete this is, the circles with the people are huge."

This tab will then appear on all your devices. Don't see the option to create it on the mobile client though. The main tab always has all chats, you could make a friends tab and have your friends chat in there. You can create a tab for chats with contacts only. This will filter all non-contacts (people that you found by @name), channels, groups, bots. true, this feature is useless if my main tab remains a mess Thank you! This is actually a thing! Archived chats are not shown in the tabs, only one you receive an update from them like a mention of reply. That's what I was missing indeed :D Thanks! Nope, they show up there normally. You have an option to filter archived or muted stuff, but by default archive doesn't affect tabs. just don't add archived chats to the excluded section of your folder settings I don't know precisely how it works maybe, but I archived some chats and channels. I don't see them in the main tab unless I receive a notification (if not muted), but I can find them all in their dedicated tab i.e. Archived and silenced channels in the channels tab

[Q]Anyone else having luck with reaching support?;19;haivgi;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/haivgi/qanyone_else_having_luck_with_reaching_support/;15;I have had a serious issue that i have reached out to all the support channels and even sent a couple of emails to TG to get help with, and it has been more than a month. Is anyone else finding that support has taken an extended vacation? I'd appreciate any advice anyone has to give please.;2020-06-17 06:11:08;"Try sending an email to qa@telegram.org
Found this in a reply by a developer to one of the review on app store. I’ve had volunteer support questions asked simce May 2019. Still not been answered. The in-app support is ""only"" volunteers. There is no email support (to my knowledge) and Twitter mostly replies to things they want to reply to.

If it's not a highly private issue, you can try asking here on Reddit, as the community often knows how to fix things out can generally aid you with tips. Once I faced serious issue in telegram. I contacted them on Twitter. Within 1 hour my issue was resolved. Twitter was the best route I personally found. I've asked four or five questions to volunteer support the last year and only got an answer the first time. An update:  
I started to have a conversation on twitter with their support, and then nothing. Still waiting. Volunteer here. We receive thousands of messages everyday so we usually answer the most recent ones. So we basically log in into system and we see the most recent questions. So volunteers go from the top to the bottom. Basically you’re getting response if there is volunteer online. Because if there is no one from TSF online your message will go to the bottom and it’s likely that no one will see it unless volunteer will crush it like for 3 hours answering all the tickets. So if you’re not getting response don’t get frustrated, just bug us again ;) I have tried twitter twice and gotten no response. And no they are not using the i/L thing.  If anyone else has had luck on twitter in the past, send me a DM and I'll link you to my account in the hopes you can help push it. Thanks! I will give this a try. What exactly is this address? I'm trying to make some noise about some pretty awful accessibility issues that are just being totally ignored. >Try sending an email to

Someone is impersonating me on telegram, and I have the logs etc. to prove it. Tried to set up social media accounts and went through the motions with username bot and a few others and have heard nothing. I guess quality assurance are they using the uppercase **i**, lowercase **L** loophole thing?"

Changed name;18;h9zju2;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/h9zju2/changed_name/;17;So I’ve blocked some people on my telegram account, however, im in a kind of situation which forces me to put my whole name on my account. Would these blocked people see that i’ve changed my name? Thank you!;2020-06-16 11:05:09;"Yes they can. You have a few choices I think

Make your name your initials, it's not quite your fullname, but it's close enough. 

Or make sure people have your phone number if you want them to have your real name as your display name, that way you can have your display name as whatever you want, and your contacts will only see the one they have set for you. I get blocked by so many people all the time. What is the motivation for people do it? What reason did you block ah communication with them? Thank you for your reply, so how can i prevent such occurrence? If someone blocks you, shrug and move on. There's nothing to be gained from thinking through it, trust me. I think the only thing you can do is to delete your chat with them, this way they can't see you in the chat tab, and hope they don't look for you. You might change the username as well, this way they can find you again only if they saved you in the contacts Actually you can't do anything. Only you can do is Create one more account and set your full name on that ID.

Lots of people stuck in that situation when your full name is mandatory  on Telegram account if you're using Telegram to receive updates from College, Company, Organization. In that case create saparate account is only good option. If you get blocked you can be limited for a week. It doesn’t do any good to block me if I don’t know what for. My bad, i havent read your reply. I guess we have the same thought What i was thinking was to delete both our chat history since telegram has this kind of feature (to delete chat both ways), which means it looked like we havent chatted at all, then change my username id. What do you think on this scenario? It depends on the context of your situation, i think, so we can never know why they block you It doesn't do /you/ any good, but no-one owes you an explanation. If they don't want to talk to you, well, you can't change their mind, and any attempt to do so is likely to further cement their decision. It sucks, but i've learned it over the years, it's the best attitude to have. Plenty more fish in the sea, etc, etc. 

if it keeps happening, i'd suggest asking your friends, and if they can't give you a good answer... Iunno, maybe a therapist? I was going to write the same thing but seen your comment and I think this is the best way to keep them away. But it doesn't stop that user to see what kinds of changes you did in your account name.  What it does it just delete chat from both side. But still that user can see your account.

If that user doesn't have your contact detail linked to your Telegram account all you can do is delete your Telegram account and create new account with that same contact number so he/she don't get notification that you joined Telegram ( if your contact  is not saved in his/her phone) But note that it will wipe out your all previous data Its like new crystal clear account. Thank you for elaborating it. I have few more questions though. I hope you wont mind.

How will he/she see my account if i’ve deleted our chat history and changed my username id? 

Furthermore, the blocked person doesnt have my contact number as far as i remember since i’ve set everything to private (i.e. only my known contacts will have my contact number synced to telegram) So anyone who ive chatted with that is out of the context of my contact number will only see my given name and username id. Im just looking for any holes for this scenario since my account already has much that it is a waste to delete and create a new one If they can't track you, then they won't see it. :)"

How do I do this?

Is there a way I could disable notification from all users and enable it just for a few of them?";2020-06-15 18:45:55;"You cannot set notifications for specific users in a group. Either all or nothing.

What you can do is enable notifications for pinned messages only. That way you get a ping when an admin pins a new message. A feature I like to see. Discord has something similar. This and if I remember correctly, you can also get a notification if you are mentioned or replied to Is there a bot to gather messages from specified users and gather them ? It would rock if I could set these messages to be sent to a channel in discord. If I remember correctly, when someone replies or mentions you the notification settings for that person apply, not the group It would have to be in the group and I doubt users would like to get their messages aggregated like that. It's doable. If you're not authorized to add a custom bot that has the ability to read messages, you can also pay someone to make a userbot with the same functionality that wouldn't require you to have a bot account (your own account would read the messages). What you're asking for is definitely feasible."

Only thing that sucks on telegram;645;h8ayb2;Telegram;https://i.redd.it/nxoxzcnaip451.jpg;56;;2020-06-13 19:45:41;"I actually like seeing that. When people finally realise that WhatsApp is terrible and join the Telegram master race it pleases me. You can disable it in the settings, whre you can chafe the messaging sound as a Telegram user in Norway, cannot relate lmao I disabled from settings but I still receive notifications Want to stop getting notifications of who joined telegram? Don't allow access to your contacts and telegram won't be able to tell ypu who joined. Why the hell does this have 500 upvotes? You can easily disable it. I have to delete 2-4 chats every single day of people joining. I mean, that's great... But it's annoying (I already disabled the notification, but the chats are opened anyway). what's the rational behind this? Try the one weird trick of changing the notification settings!  I turd this off a while ago and couldn't find where to turn it back on today The group notifications are even more annoying I wish I had that many people joining telegram so that this could be an issue lol! The stupidest thing is the FWD having your name on it.
And that's not even configurable Wait... you guys are getting notifications from that? I only have one contact here that uses TG.. the rest are fb messenger. It’s right there in the settings. I’m surprised someone would make such meme without checking first lol I swear! Where's the MVP who's gonna tell us how to disable this crap? One thing I like about the feature; 
Since telegram syncs contacts across devices... And kind of saves the contacts on a phone to their database, then when a very old contact from my way older phones {apparently lost or damaged} joins telegram, I can recover that contact and resave properly. I've been able to reconnect with some of my buddies that way. Furries' worst nightmare Yes, but a pop up message would suffice  No need to create a new and empty chat window.

Maybe a section ""contacts I have never chatted with"". That would tidy up the main chat overview. Same I like it because I'm like oh hey I can message this person now! The issue is even disabling the push notification, Telegram makes a new chat that you have to delete. Which introduces an awkward UX of ""If I delete this chat, are they going to get a notification that I deleted their conversation?"" So I just end up with a bunch of chats of people that I knew 10 years ago and will never message. I don't have much, but take this 🏅 They should just straight up remove the feature entirely Are you ok? Why not? What do they use the most over there? sms? iMessage? Ditto Exactly me You can't disable the new chat being created https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/h8ayb2/only_thing_that_sucks_on_telegram/fuq0fy3?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share That *you are not alone, a new user is here with you, though he's far away, if you send a sticker he'll be here to stay*, maybe? [deleted] Settings, notifications and sounds, last option Nothing worse than having a cropped gay yiff picture as your avatar and seeing that your dad is now using Telegram. Yeah, true! I guess for me it's never been an issue because I don't get the notification that often. And when I do it's almost like a little dopamine rush (depending on the person lol) Exactly, why the hell are those new chats created at all? They should modify this behaviour. Brb, off to write this in my review on Google Play, they need to be made aware. Yeah FB Messenger does the same thing. ""Say hello to your new friend!"" no fuck off I put them in the archives Facebook Messenger, sadly thanks but didn't occur to me that way lol No, it is not. Check the comments and everyone agrees without actually knowing there is section where you turn that feature off. You mean ""contact joined telegram""? I have it turned off and STILL get the stupid notifications. Oh you're one of those people that think the review section is where you submit bug reports.  Everyone point and laugh. Big ooof. I had to download whatsapp because my mates at the Uni won’t use or don’t know about Telegram. I feel like shite every time I use it. The good thing: I managed to convince one my professors to try it out and she actually loved it! Yeah, especially with the post's caption of ""Only thing that sucks on telegram"" You also need to Delete Synced Contacts or whatever that option is called, I think. Oh, and turn off Contact Sync. This is a flaw in the app, what’s wrong with highlighting it in a review? For new users who read the reviews before downloading, it’s certainly something worth knowing. I’d certainly appreciate the information. Lol I didn't realize it was wrong to do that Don’t give up bro, keep convincing people, I’ve made it with my bachelor friends, some of them are most of time on Telegram now ;) > The good thing: I managed to convince one my professors to try it out and she actually loved it!

my biggest argument is ""people can join without disclosure their phone number!"" [deleted] Yeah you're right, we need to disable contact sync option to get totally rid of it. But I don't want to disable contacts sync, as that has other consequences. How about you report it in the proper channels instead of doing the opposite of productive by leaving it in a buried review that won't be seen. The possibility of using Telegram as the main way of communicating next semester in all my university was discarded because a talented guy that knows a lot and works there, said that it’s not a good idea for security reasons: “not a good thing that students can see all their teacher phone numbers”. I hate him since that moment 😂 Agreed. Yes, the highlight-in-review should only be done in addition to feedback in the proper channels. I’m sure it has been reported many times. This behaviour has existed for so long without being addressed that I feel publicising it is the only avenue we have to gain their attention.

Telegram is a great app but this one obnoxious quirk is souring the experience. It is by far the most common complaint I’ve heard from my peers since forever. Most of them use WhatsApp primarily. You definitely make a valid point. In addition to my review, I'll also report it in the proper channel, thanks. ""I'm sure it has been reported many times"" he says as he improperly reports it/doesn't report it. Go yell at telegram on Twitter, you can actually gain traction there and that's where you're SUPPOSED to yell at them.  

Also, you when does telegram EVER notify the other person of a deletion in any context?  Never, it never does, so you can delete those chats without issue.  Then you remove the contacts permission from telegram, turn off contact sync, and clear what is synced (there's a button for this too). Someone had a bad day. Easy there bud."

Mark Zuckerberg and Pavel Durov were born within five months of each other, they very well could have gone to school together. Fake... We all know Zuckerberg looks like an Android I tried a reverse image search, but only found this: [https://twitter.com/dojjavu/status/1063960469772357632](https://twitter.com/dojjavu/status/1063960469772357632) You could ask him where he found it. Best I could find was @jyrkka I'm guessing the green guy is Whatsapp and blue is ofc Facebook I know i've seen it but i can't find it. I've searched in Durov's channel and in the 6 years blog post Can you cite where on the internet it was you found it? What's that Someone who has Instagram should ask [https://www.instagram.com/ohuenkoart/](https://www.instagram.com/ohuenkoart/) if he drew it.

Edit: he also has Telegram. I mean, they had ""animated stickers"" on Messenger first. But like... 2-3 frames long. 

This is the one that will most probably arrive on WhatsApp in 2 years at maximum. Not the 60 FPS by Telegram 🤭 Nah. Like always, like 3 years later and 6fps. There are already animated sticker on whatsapp, but only on desktop. Lol, I remember reading a security experts article that compared messaging apps in 2013, and I remember it made the point that Telegram had copied WhatsApp UI to extreme detail. Something people here would very much like to forget. Telegram is to WhatsApp to what VKontakte was to Facebook. A copy-cat. 5 months and 5 thousand miles apart 😄 > could have gone to school together

except that Pavel was born in the Soviet Union during the **cold war**, and grew up in Italy and post-soviet Russia Maybe he can ask him were did he found the image Tried even advanced Google Search but can't find anything I don't remember. I saved the picture from an article describing the reasons to switch to Telegram. 

But I know that design is from a Telegram Blog so I'm curious which one is. Seems fun to read. Thank you for this... It's literally the guy behind the artwork of Telegram. 😱 Happy Cake Day 😇 Useful I'm feeling like r/woooosh maybe just a fanart from the smae article editors mocking the style of telegram's blogs"

Looks like they ditched giphy after all.;54;h7u59w;Telegram;https://i.imgur.com/UAYVrYo.jpg;18;;2020-06-13 01:03:21;"I think this was mentioned on their Twitter but glad to see it enacted so fast. It's awful how many good services are being bought up by awful companies, limiting their usefulness for others. What is the next evolution of gifs? Like there has to be a more HD and smaller size format right? Why hasn't gif died out? Tenor is owned by Google, so I'm not really sure whether to feel good or not. GIFs are hot garbage since the last update. Some bargain bin quality shit. What happened? [deleted] Animated PNGs (apng) have been around for a while. It's not a widely supported format though, which is a shame since it supports better transparency and produces smaller file sizes. WebP is another format that's gaining in popularity especially on platforms such as Tumblr as an alternative to GIFs since they compress better. In a comparison made between GIF, APNG and WebP, it was shown, however, that APNG kept lower file size while keeping at least equal quality. In fact, GIFs in Telegram are just MP4s without sound. [https://telegram.org/blog/gif-revolution](https://telegram.org/blog/gif-revolution) (2016) Yup true that... 🤷🏻‍♂️ ...they removed Giphy. Its high quality is why they were bought. 100% agreed but I guess there’s no relevant alternative atm Smaller file sizes? That's funny, normally PNG tends to be one of the largest.

Hopefully it gets more support, the best formats are pretty much always the ones that aren't supported. whats the reason for the removal? After a bit of googling, it seems I misremembered - apngs do tend to be larger than their gif equivalent. They do support a wider range of colours and transparency though.

I may have been thinking of webp, which seems to produce smaller files. https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/01/animated-png-format-compare-animated-webp-gif/ has a handy comparison. Facebook acquired Giphy recently. Owing to privacy concerns over them tracking people's usage behavior through GIFs shared on the platform and Telegram being a direct competitor to FB owned Whatsapp Messenger, they decided to switch to a different provider. Hm, I guess aPNGs do have their place, but animated WebPs might be a better standard. wow that sucks thanks for the info Isn't Tenor owned by Google? I only hope that GIF searches are proxyed... Did Telegram publicly announce their switch to Tenor? Because Giphy is far superior and imo Tenor is shite. I don’t see how it’s better to switch to Tenor when they are owned by Google."

It means that the call request was successfully sent and the app is now waiting for any app on the other side to receive the ""update"" and confirm and allow the call reception. If there are multiple apps or devices, the server will wait for the first among them to do so. This will time out and fail if no apps confirm the call in 20 seconds.

Does Telegram is ok to use for kids and teenagers ? with all the NSFW there ?;0;h0ydli;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/h0ydli/does_telegram_is_ok_to_use_for_kids_and_teenagers/;97;[removed];2020-06-11 15:28:49;"unless they actually search and click on the link for those channels or groups,they wont be able to get in those groups or channels Yeah, WhatsApp don't have channels, but I already see announces of public groups that share inappropriate content.

There are NSFW content everywhere, if they search they I'll find.
Telegram at least don't need to share a phone number if the kids access any group or channel. I've been using Telegram every day since 2013 and have never come across inappropriate content. I don't even know how you find it. Searching for porn channels I guess? [deleted] I'd rather have my kid watch porn (which they'll do anyway) than have their data being stolen.

The internet is full of NSFW. Telegram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and WhatsApp too, if one knows, how to find it. If you're from the EU or UK you are not allowed to use Telegram if you're under the age of 16, as per the Terms of Service.

https://telegram.org/tos

Edit to add to this: As per the TOS it is also not allowed to publicly post illegal pornographic content.

> Post illegal pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels, bots, etc.

Also there will always be ways for kids/children to find pornographic content. If you fear your kids might find this kind of sensitive content, keep them off the internet. The public channels and groups are one problem, but since telegram announced location based groups and channels, you will get pornographic content in your face even without searching for it.
I think it's a problem. Okay, first of all, Facebook allows child porn. I’ve seen it up there, reported it, **and was told it didn’t violate their terms**. I escalated the report, saying the law superseded their terms, and they told me I was wrong and that was that. 

Facebook owns WhatsApp. 

Second of all, Apple isn’t blocking anything on Telegram. Telegram is doing that. I have an iPhone and no channels are blocked on my Telegram. You have to log in to the web app and disable sensitive content blocking. That option does not exist in the app on Windows, iOS, or Android. So you have to go through the web and disable it there. You’re welcome. ;)

Third, sex is a need like food, drink, and sleep past a certain age. Nobody’s dying without it, and yet still our brains compel us to go get some. Or watch people getting some. It’s natural, and teens start seeking it younger than you think. Girls, generally a few years before boys. 

You can’t teach a kid to not want sex as a teenager. The body doesn’t work that way. If you disagree, don’t have kids. Babies shit Abe that’s gross, and you gotta clean it up. Boys jack and girls rub and you’re gonna walk in on it sometimes, and that’s gross too, but it’s human nature. Can’t deal? Get a cat. But if you *can* deal, you gotta teach them right from wrong, in all things. Teach them about porn — and no, don’t *show* it to them — and why sex work exists and what sex trafficking is and why it’s bad and how with amateur porn, you really can’t be sure everyone is consenting and why that’s important. If all that sounds like too much work... get a cat. I wouldn't trust random third party apps - you don't know what they did to the original telegram code. Some third party apps are regarded as trustworthy and have a good reputation but I have also heard about shitty forks. Don't use telegram forks unless you trust the devs of it especially when it's for you children.

Telegram tries to ban porn groups, channels and bots but a lot of them are still accessible. However I would be surprised if the app you linked does a better job. Honestly I wouldn't even be worried about these things, you won't stumble across them if you don't search for them and blocking adult content usually doesn't work anyway. The only solution is talking about this stuff openly everything else will fail.

What I would be worried about on Telegram is spam and horny dudes messaging basically every female looking account they can find. Seriously, there are way too many on Telegram, generally on the internet but especially on Telegram. I wouldn’t worry about it man... I’ve used it for years and besides the hilariously inappropriate comments and images my mates share in a private group it’s all just good. Plus the stickers are just amazing.. Yes, perfectly safe. It is not that easy unless you are actively searching for porn. In which case, your kids will have access to porn anyways It is definitely common on many groups of WhatsApp. If your child is on internet you can't stop him forcefully from watching NSFW.

moral education plays the greatest here. Funny enough there are some sticker packs that are not intended for kids. Lol, did you come here to advertise for Teleteens? Dork. Theres ""1+"" download for that app. Is that you? The real question for you should be the next: Does Internet is ok to use for kids and teenagers? Hijacking top comment.

Look at his post history. The guy is a paid marketing shill promoting a ""safe for teens"" client of telegram called Teleteens.

He's not here for actual discussion, don't waste your time. well there is an app that prevents the ability to see channels and public groups at all, called Teleteens;

 [Teleteens - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ori.telegram.app&gl=IL) well, i can say the same thing about everything on the internet lol. that's not a valid argument, i think. 1. you have  seen announces of public groups that share inappropriate content ? on whatsapp ? it's not a problem, because: A. they are probably rare. B. there is an element of shame entering this groups and exposing phone number.
2. true, Telegram doesn't need you to share phone number, but that's the problem: people think nobody knows where they go in telegram, but actually this app isn't secrue as it show itself. so they are exposed anyway the search box at Telegram app itself allows you to search for keywords like model names, or slightly NSFW words (you can't search for ""sex"" but you can't search ""bikini"").

also, you can log into channels and public groups at websites that publish links to enter there. educate them to not watch porn, so genius. 

how i didn't thought about that earlier ? i don't remember  Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or WhatsApp blocked by apple due to child porn on their platform,

but Telegram **was** blocked for a short period of time at 2018.

&#x200B;

so here is the thing: at Facebook, snapchat and whatsapp you might see some bikini, some nudity ect, but no PORN, like it's a internet browser, for example: facebook hires people to filter facebook content around the clock. Telegram doesn't.

&#x200B;

at Telegram, **everything** is a fair game, only recently child porn was also found there... The 16 year age limit is for European law and as far as I can tell not enforced at all. Technically for the law it would be okay if you have your parents permissions so I doubt they would do anything if that's the case. i disagree.

first off, to enforce this rule would be hard to do. unless google play does it themselves. but i am not sure they do.

&#x200B;

 

> Also there will always be ways for kids/children to find pornographic content. If you fear your kids might find this kind of sensitive content, keep them off the internet. 

look, it's not black or white - how about a situation where kids need to have Telegram because all their mates are using this ? >  location based groups and channels 

what's that ? how does it work ? 1. sorry to hear this story, but you can't expect me to draw conclusions from 1 story, right ? i was probably a mistake, (not a feature, a bug).

>You have to log in to the web app and disable sensitive content blocking

2. i am not sure i understand, are you talking about screen time of apple ?

>It’s natural

3. porn is natural ? well, your opinion if porn of a woman getting gang banged by 3 people to be shown to a 11 years old kid is natural.

>You can’t teach a kid to not want sex as a teenager. The body doesn’t work that way. If you disagree, don’t have kids. Babies shit Abe that’s gross, and you gotta clean it up. Boys jack and girls rub and you’re gonna walk in on it sometimes

4. i guess that's what facebook told you when you complained about the child porn you have seen ? from all the third party Telegram apps in the world, THAT one you don't trust? lol.

i myself read the Teleteens app description and it's sound legit.
i downloaded it and actually, it does actually a great job, all possible ways to enter public places has been totally gone. lol, but you are not a kid probably.

&#x200B;

so there is a risk that a parent will give his kid a phone with telegram to chat with his friends, and won't understand that he just gave him all the porn content there is. dude...  i can say the same for pornhub... 
""pornhub is perfectly safe for kids, IF they don't actively search porn there"" not the groups i know of. why am i not surprised haha that's the biggest compliment anybody gave me over a decade. thanks. :)

i never knew i can code a 500 million user app by myself.

&#x200B;

its says 1+, that's because google doesn't say precise numbers. so +1 can mean 5 or 2 or 9.

&#x200B;

but i will be forever known among the first 10 who download this app. hooray ! Then hide them from the whole of internet. Looks like you cracked the code. We can all go home now, eh? You basically disqualify this question with that understanding. If you are actually concerned with what your kid is doing on the internet, you would be monitoring them and be taking an active role in their online presence. IE: Checking who they are messaging, what sites are they visiting, how long they are on the internet.

If you are doing these things then there should be no worry about what access the app provides, because you should know all of the groups they are in and be actively keeping track.

Its no different than allowing access to Google, if there's a will there is a way, and the only way to moderate that is to moderate your kids, and teach them about acceptable uses of the internet and your rules. > this app isn't secrue as it show itself

What do you base this claim on? Fair enough if you actively search for it. I mean you can get the same thing from Google. You can do pretty much the same on any social media/msg app They will watch porn anyway, you can't hide the internet from them.

Educate them why they shouldn't join random messenger groups and why it can be dangerous. And how to be safe in the internet, which works on non-porn sites too. As if Apple is a trustworthy element in this chain. Of course, they won't block Snapchat and Facebook — those are huge companies and business partners of Apple, whereas Telegram is, in comparison, a small, independent project.

Searching ""nude"", "" sex"", ""NSFW"" on Facebook reveals concerning photos and groups, some of which are encouraging the user to ""exchange nude pics in a private WhatsApp group"". Porn accounts on Snapchat are also popular. They don't post in Stories but add them a friend, and they'll send you very explicit snaps.

Porn is everywhere to find, even on YouTube. It should be the parents' responsibility to educate their children about the internet etiquette, NSFW content and the danger of paedophiles. And, as pointed out by one of the commenters, most companies' Terms of Service forbid the usage of the said services for children under 13, 16 and in some countries even 18 years old.

Want a secure solution for chats and no porn? Use Signal. > i disagree.

That's not an matter about opinion. Telegram forbids it, so it's not allowed. Since they are not actively on the lookout for new public channels that post it, they rely on reports from users to check and ban those channels.

> unless google play does it themselves.

Correct, Apple banned Telegram from the App Store because of reports from media outlets and users that there was pornographic content publicly available. Due to these reports Telegram banned the offending channels and groups, which got Telegram back onto the store again. It is literally impossible to moderate all content on Telegram. That's why Telegram relies on user reports to detect and ban the offending content and users.

> how about a situation where kids need to have Telegram because all their mates are using this ?

Literally my whole school class was using WhatsApp back in the day. I didn't like WhatsApp so I didn't use it. Saying ""all their mates are using this"" is not really much of a valid point.

As I've said before, if you fear your child might find inappropriate content on Telegram you have two options.

1. Shrug it off as they'll find it sooner or later anyway
2. Prevent them from finding it in the first place and being extremely cautious by watching everything they do in Telegram (or online in general)

Your call. In contacts section there's a option of find people nearby Okay I didn't know it disabled all public groups and channels.

But you might want to read my comment again, I don't trust any third party app unless it has a good reputation and I know who makes it.

Anyways without public groups at all I don't get why anyone would use Telegram, at this point I would just use Signal or Wire. > ​
> 
> 

a phone has all the porn content there is anyways If one kid sent an sms with the text http://pronhub.com he’s just sent all the porn there is. I understand your dilemma but I don’t think telegram groups are the problem. ;) np. Cherish it always. yes i did. because it's a foolish argument.

""drugs ? not dangerous to kids at all - if they don't buy them"" come on.... they don't even have to be in a NSFW channel in order to see it. 

that's naive to think that me ""checking"" them is going to solve anything.

&#x200B;

> if there's a will there is a way 

yeah ? can you search in the internet for, let's say, 10 NSFW Whatsapp groups ? and enter them without shame ?

in Telegram there are links to 1000 NSFW channels.

so it's not about will, it's about access and how an app is build. 1. whatsapp have end to end encription, telegram doesn't (only this secret chat thing is end to end).
2. we don't know what pavel is doing with the information running on telegram servers. you can choose to trust him, or don't. either way - you can't be sure. true, but there is a ton of filtering apps that prevent the search of keywords like this on google, there is nothing (i know of) that filters telegram.

&#x200B;

so let's assume you have a kid, that all his friend are in Telegram, so he really wants to use it, and if he won't he will be isolated. on the other hand he does use it he has access to all porn the world has to offer, it's hard for the parent to decide. are you sure ? see my respond to  [NickKaramoff](https://www.reddit.com/user/NickKaramoff/) Apple clearly disagree with you, same with steve jobs, who refused to allow porn apps into app store. thanks for the comment, interesting stuff.

but there is a major think you forget about all that: in facebook, snapchat and instegram, all the process you have described, is through some pathway of exposure, for example: joining whatsapp group (and exposing phone number). adding someone a friend (and thus he can see a lot of your info).

what's my point ? most people are too shy/shameful to take this extra step to reach explicit content.

&#x200B;

on Telegram, there is no such problem: you can join a group without them knowing your information. and without any announce of you joining and leaving.

&#x200B;

signal is great, but signal is not where the kids friends are staying. there is no app to prevent such content on Telegram ? none that you know of ? yeah i know this ""find people nearby"" thing. i though you  can find there only users, not groups or channels.

&#x200B;

so Telegram becomes even more nastier for kids lol looks like there is an app that removes the option to ""  find people nearby "", called Teleteens:

 [Teleteens - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ori.telegram.app&gl=IL) >Anyways without public groups at all I don't get why anyone would use Telegram, at this point I would just use Signal or Wire.

&#x200B;

there are 1,500,000,000 people who use Whatsapp without any public groups at all and they are quite happy with it. or so i have heard.

&#x200B;

about trust: so how did all the dozens of third party apps of Telegram get trust at the first place ? i think you are over suspicious. it's a vague saying.. Exactly. Now you’re starting to get it.

You should also add “use them”. You do realize they can get free drugs right? No, i can search google for porn. Which is actually easier than searching a group on any platform and joining it, and i will get far more results than porn on telegram. With explicit categories. And thousands of videos/pics on each category. And for aaaaall of that, you just, literally, type “porn” in the google search box.

Oh and wait until you hear about the recent news about hundreds of thousands of phone numbers leaked from whatsapp. You do realize that you can make a porn group and invite all those numbers that are now public right? 

Hell any of your childs friends can automatically add them to a porn group on whatsapp and now what? Boo hoo shame on you for having being invited without your permission.

It really sounds like you’re a karen. Are you going to be in every porn chat out there to be making sure they are not in them?

I could easily find hundreds of public porn chats on Whatsapp with a quick google search.

Here's how my process would work if I were a kid desperate to get porn only through whatsapp.

1. Find any number of publicly accessible invites to porn groups
2. Join the porn group when I want to jack off
3. Jack off
4. Leave the group
5. Maybe I'll keep the url in case I get a little frisky later


Nobody on these porn chats are there to snitch on their participants, they are there to jerk off. Nothing is stopping me from treating it as a temporary porn site. If it was e2e encrypted, how would backups work? Backups stored in your cloud are not stored in an encrypted way. That way Apple could just access your Cloud storage and read literally all your chats you wrote up to the point you backed up. The messages you send to the recipient are encrypted, but neither are the messages on your, nor their device.

The data on Telegram servers is encrypted with a key that's split up across multiple data centers, so no single jurisdiction has access to the data. Not even Telegram. [As they've stated in their FAQ](https://telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-process-data-requests), they have disclosed a total of `0 bytes` of data to any third parties.

I recommend you ask Telegram and WhatsApp over on Twitter on how their Security works. Or you read the very well documented implementation in Telegrams FAQs. And you know what is happening on WhatsApp servers? End-to-end encryption could be a total invention to make people feel safer. It’s just about trusting Zuckerberg or no, do you trust Zuckerberg? Have u read recent news and all the problems he has had for data leaks? I definitely don’t trust him.

PD: Have u read when you are going to backup that messages won’t be end-to-end encrypted? There is where your “great security” is gone and is available to FBI, NSA, etc If it was e2e encrypted, how would you expect telegram to be able to censor the sensitive content ? Wow... just... wow.

I won’t even try to explain. Which leads to a healthier kid, friends and porn, or no friends and no porn? It's fine jees. Just let him chat with his friends. Whatever chat app you use, there is porn, and his friends can send him porn. I am not talking about channels/groupchats exclusively. I am saying that one can access NSFW content on and/or via any social media app Well, cool, trust those guys, don't educate.

You don't really need any apps besides the default ones to find porn nowadays. What is to stop someone from creating an fake account with fake names on any other platforms?

You could just as easily sign in and sign out of the primary account for Facebook, Snap, twitter, etc...

I could make an account with the name John Smith, and no one would know how much gay furry anime porn I watch. You as an end user cannot prevent what gets posted in channels you're not admin in.

There is also no app that can control what gets posted. dude, where ever you live, i am feeling sorry you live there. please get out to a better place. there are dozens of filtering, monitering and checking apps to prevent porn on google.

Telegram ? not so much.

&#x200B;

about the numbers: i don't really understand your point... >Nobody on these porn chats are there to snitch on their participants, they are there to jerk off. 

oh thanks you, i feel so reassured now. i don't trust  Zuckerberg . i trust his greed.

i know for a fact that he is interested to keep all data secured, otherwise people like you will switch to other apps and lose him money.

i didn't knew about backup thing, thanks for telling me.

&#x200B;

but who is this pavel ? where the hell he got so much money to run servers for 500,000,000 people ? do you know how much it costs him ? and for ""free chat of the kindness of his heart"" ? come on,=... like whatsapp do: the ability to not see public groups and channels at all. like it doesn't exist.
they can make 2 apps: one with channels (and censored, and without e2e) and one without them (and not censored, and with e2e). good question here actually. time will tell. friend's messaging porn is something very limited compared to channel's porn or public group porn. not like Telegram.

for example, you can't see porn like Telegram has in their channel, in a place like facebook.

any way, i found an app to fix the problem called Teleteens. so i am cool.

 [Teleteens - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ori.telegram.app&gl=IL) i don't think apple encourage people not to educate their kids, all i am saying that some things must be kept away from young minds until they get older, like nudity, drugs and alcohol.

how young - good question that is debatable. but in general it's true.

&#x200B;

>You don't really need any apps besides the default ones to find porn nowadays.

&#x200B;

sure, in google chrome you can find all porn easy.

but google chrome has tons of filtering and blocking apps, Telegram doesn't. despite the fact it has porn the same level like the internet browser. good point.

but let me challenge you further: most likely, a user browsing through facebook is using his computer.
this browser can be filtered, monitered ect - by multiple apps existing on market today.

furthermore, at facebook there are parent control, which i assume, facebook engineers were smart enough to forbid the use of switching facebook accounts. and even if they did - facebook parent control will mmoniter what they did there.

so i am afraid that dear gay john smith is going to get into trouble. :)

Telegram on the other hand, doesn't have this kind of service. at all. there is an app that controls if you can see channels/public groups at all:

 [Teleteens - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ori.telegram.app&gl=IL) I live in a place called reality. My point is that whatsapp is not the secure heaven you think it is. 

Yeah there are filters, indeed. Judging by how you talk about these matters, i highly doubt you know how to actually use them.

If you want to check on them you gotta put parental control on their devices, not on their apps. But even then...

Oh i’m being monitored on google? Time to use duckduckgo! And let’s not talk about other stuff like vpn or vms.

Oh they’re monitoring my browser? Time to search for “the most private browser” on GOOGLE and install tor. Voila! No more monitoring! 

If you actually think that you can control what your kids do on the internet, you should start by learning how it works. ASAP. 

But lemme tell you what the conclusion will be after your little adventure on the internet:

The only way to know that they’re doing the right thing is to EDUCATE THEM. 

And don’t let your kids on reddit. Ever. Ever never ever ever. The point was to show you how easy it is to beat the system with persistence. Any platform can be exploited given enough effort. VK As far as what you do in the browser, I can't tell you how easy it is to bypass child restrictions on the internet. If your kids are dedicated enough to get around them they will. I know I did when I was young. While the internet was a wilder place, there are lots of guides and information, now more than ever before on how to defeat these kind of systems. All it takes is a little tech savy.


But even discounting whatever you can physically prevent your kid from accessing with firewalls and child apps, officially Facebook's stance is that you should focus on EDUCATING your kid about online safety.

> We encourage parents to exercise any discretion they can on their own computers and in overseeing their kids' internet use. Please talk to your kids, educate them about internet safety

[https://www.facebook.com/help/156236274442491/](https://www.facebook.com/help/156236274442491/) 


Also this doesn't cover whatsapp, where a person could just set up a google voice number or a skype number and create a new account as well. looks like there is an app that filters Telegram and it's ok for kids, it's called Teleteens:

 [Teleteens - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ori.telegram.app&gl=IL) >I can't tell you how easy it is to bypass child restrictions on the internet

i welcome you to find (for example) how to bypass screen time of the comapny apple. go ahead, do it. if you are so clever. :)

&#x200B;

> officially Facebook's stance is that you should focus on EDUCATING your kid about online safety. 

so why they put parent controls ? 

 

>Also this doesn't cover whatsapp, where a person could just set up a google voice number or a skype number and create a new account as well.

but it's a hassle - disconnecting from my account, entering a new one... switch number again and again. not fun at all. Then give it a shot. Maybe it’s helpful. 

But for real, is far more effective and efficient to just educate your kids about it and make them conscious about it so they themselves can avoid it. I personally do not have an apple device because I do not believe in their company philosophy regarding software/hardware, but what I do have is historic evidence that it has been bypassed very easily.

[https://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/09/26/bypass-screen-time/](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/09/26/bypass-screen-time/)

> When iOS 12 came out I limited my 7-year old son’s screen time through the family share. For a few days I felt like he was playing a bit more than he should, but I couldn’t figure out why.

A 7 year old kid bypassed screentime in a matter of days. To say that its impossible for even a fully grown adult like myself to beat it is kinda insulting ngl.

If I had an iPhone, you bet I would break it and report back.


EDIT: LOL if you think switching accounts is enough hassle to get in the way of horny kids, you have got to keep a better watch over your kids. They probably already are bypassing all of your measures already. you know what ? maybe we are both right: it's important to educate, and it's not bad to have this app (like Teleteens) 
to give to your kid if he find it hard to resist the urge or something. oh you are 1000% correct that at early days, screen time was easy to bypass like a walk in the park, not anymore.

that was iOs 12, now it's 13. 
it's true that at 12 there was an opening, not anymore.

my point is: air-tight block on content is possible.  looks like there is an app that blocks all use to channels and public groups , it's called Teleteens:

Notification sounds on Android have been changed to whatever the default sound is and won't change back to the way I had it.  Anyone else having this issue? I put Telegram's desktop one as notification sound on mobile too. I'd be up for this I'd be anyways for this. Oh so I’m not the only one with this issue! I’ve been messaging volunteer support and tweeting for info about that but nobody ever replied! 

It definitely sucks but at least I now know that I’m not the only one to have that issue! The one for Windows is pretty generic (not even sure if it’s one of Windows own built in system sound)
For macOS and iOS there’s only options for built in system’s sounds. 
For Android you could change to your own custom sound sure~

But there’s no 1 sound (or a few) to identify “ah, that’s from Telegram” across all platforms. 

It’s more of a brand identity kind of thing. Like I could instantly differentiate what messaging apps they’re using when I’m watching a show by their sounds eg. Facebook messenger’s “bubding~”, KakaoTalk’s “katok~”, LINE messenger’s “liiine~” and even Signal’s hard-to-describe one. I’d be side for this On the AppStore I saw Telegram replying to one of the review, so I posted one hoping an action would be taken but nothing. I do enjoy using Telegram for the fact that messaging is way more fun and call quality is great but it sucks when you lock screen for some reason just after sending a message and then receive a notification 2-5 minutes after other person sending a message. It happens for calls too sometimes. I'd be upside down for this"

There are no telegram specific ban commands, these come from bots and there are many different ones. Try to type /help in a private chat with the bot your group is using - should usually list all commands you can use

If you don't use a bot then just right click / long press a user and use the manage group settings and you have everything you need I moderated, along with others, at geektogo site. A good read of the site's guidelines, privacy statements, and common sense gave me very good information on what to look for. I could always refer problems I wasn't sure about to the site's admin.

&#x200B;

Moderating a group chat will more likely be a bit more difficult as chatting may involve a lot of those text abbreviations which may or not be subject to being banned. Look for the guidelines. The admin should have those up for all to see. Good luck and stay safe. Thank you so much!"

Is my phone number really hidden?;41;h0dg1d;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/h0dg1d/is_my_phone_number_really_hidden/;32;So I never wanted to make  telegram because I was scared of the whole phone number part. I finally decided to do it. I DONT sync my contacts. Sent phone number to nobody, etc and less than a minute after I get a group invite from a friend of mine? How did this happen? I didn’t sync anything? Who can see my number?;2020-06-10 18:41:18;"Check your settings -> privacy so it is hidden to people you chat with now.

You didn't sync your address book, but your friend did.
So I guess when Telegram discovered your number in his address book, they shot him a message saying ""xy just joined Telegram""

This doesn't mean your phone number is visible now to anyone, it's just that people that have your number will find you on Telegram after joining. Go to Settings -> Privacy -> Phone Number and set ""Who can find me by my number"" to ""My Contacts"". That way, even when one of your friends has your phone number, they won't find your Telegram account (unless *you* also have their phone number saved and sync that to Telegram). Of course your friend who already found you still knows your account, unless you delete it and create a new one.

You can also go to Privacy -> Data Settings -> Delete Synced Contacts to make sure you didn't accidentally sync any of your contacts to Telegram. Please check if your settings match [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/gyeool/what_information_is_disclosed_to_others_in/ftcghqf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). Afk everybody that has your number in their contacts will be able to text you in telegram, even if you dont see them in your telegram contact list. The privacy settings only blocks any new people that you message in telegram to see your number. If your friend had your phone number to begin with, then they would know you joined Telegram.

That’s only if your friend already had it in the first place, telegram didn’t reveal it to them. Can anyone see what groups I’m in? That’s stupid. Thank god I put myself a random name cause I was being overly cautious.... I JUST SAW THAT MY CONTACTS WERE SYNCED??? Even though I did NOT ALLOW IT TO ACCESS MY CONTACTS??? No, only the groups you have in common if you mean channel, then - no. only channel owners can see. if you're in a group chat, then only those who have your number on their addressbook will see your number. other group chat members will see your name and login. People who are in the same group as you can see what groups you both are in. Nobody gets a list of all groups you're in. I'm curious, why don't you want you friends to chat to you on telegram? So like I have had friend's past phone numbers join and it will give me ""*friend's name ^(as written in my contacts)* has joined Telegram"" but like for example my German friend's cell phone number has changed because she moved back to Germany and then back to Canada and her original number joined Telegram. But it's definitely not her, so it shows her name next to the photo of some big guy and his paintball buddies. I can't see the name that he has set for himself, only the @handle that he has set, if he set one If you didn't give the app permission to access your contacts (check the iOS/Abdroid settings for the permissions you granted to the app), it can't access your contacts even if the ""Sync Contacts"" setting in the app is enabled. You should still disable it anyways, otherwise the app will nag you that it doesn't have permissions to access your contacts.

The setting is enabled by default (although you should be able to disable it during account creation/login), so it's easy to miss. So say my friend has telegram with contacts synced, I don’t have them synced. That person won’t be able to see what channels or groups I’m in right? Because I use WhatsApp for friends Oh I see. So the reason my friend was able to message me was because he had his contacts synced? Doesn’t matter if I don’t? yes, you're right. they see nothing but your avatar, name, username, and the number(if they already have it). Hey, to clarify, nobody can see which channels you follow, only the admin of a channel who see who follows it. Same for groups, only other people in the group can see you're there, not anyone in your Contacts. I used to too, but now I use about half and half. Telegram is so much better than Whatsapp I wish all my friends were using it. He was able to message you because he has your number in his contacts. Telegram sends him a notification ""XYZ joined Telegram"" when you create an account with that number.

I'm pretty sure that happens even if you don't sync your contacts, although the ""Who can find me by my number"" setting should prevent it. But because you can only change that setting after you already created your account, I'm not sure if the friend already received that notification at that point. Well I downloaded it because supposedly it’s private and the first thing it does is tell everyone I know that I made an account It even told my fucking mom ffs That’s really stupid. If I don’t sync my contacts it’s for something telegram. Also you can’t even make it so that no one can find you by your number. Your contacts (who are probably the ones you specifically don’t want to be found by) can still do it... Your conversations are private, the fact that you're on Telegram isn't private. Same as Whatsapp - anyone with your number can message you on whatsapp. I don't see the problem, why don't you want your mum messaging you on Telegram? She probably won't. If you don't have any contacts synced, the ""My Contacts"" setting is effectively ""Nobody"". But yeah, Telegram really wants you to get all your friends to join, when you don't want to use it for your IRL friends it's best to register with one of those fake numbers (Google Voice, TextFree, etc.), but even that can be difficult because many of those numbers are blocked. But it doesn’t send them a notification saying I joined. They have to purposely search me. Yeah and I can’t do it from where I’m from. It sucks. I know, this is one of the ways Telegram increases activity. It gets annoying though so I turned off the notification. I got it to work using a VPN and many tries, but it's far from easy. You can make it so people who have you don’t get a notification? No but you can disable the notifications on your own phone. Use a temporary no. If you're that worried ffs"

Automatic chat backup;5;h08a0l;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/h08a0l/automatic_chat_backup/;12;"Hello all,

I'd like to automatically backup all of my chat history. I search around, but haven't found anything. So I'm asking:

* Does such a tool already exist?
* What would you use to do it? I see there are a few CLI clients, but are outdated and do not support it
* Do you know if the API supports it? I can write my own script for it (and share it on github of course) but if someone more comfortable with the API could point me to the right direction I'd appreciate it. I found \`getChatHistory() \` but only returns the messages, not the full content

&#x200B;

Any help is appreciated, thanks!";2020-06-10 13:35:38;"A huge part of Telegram is based on a cloud concept which aims to remove the need for backups.

They state this in their FAQ; why do you need to backup your chats?

One of the things I would try is check out the gdrp data extraction tool but I don't know if that contains full chat histories but certainly worth a try. I'm also interested in this.

**Reason:** I mainly use Telegram to chat with my wife. We switched to Telegram in march 2013 and since then, we got 2 children, etc. so many interesting messages, pictures and more are stored on Telegram's servers. Yes, the media is also backed up on my personal servers via Seafile, but we'd really like to keep our messages as well.

Let's say I'm going to die. My account will be automatically deleted after 1 year of inactivity. Is my chat with my wife gone as well? I don't know... Or what if Telegram doesn't exist any more in a couple years? We just don't want to lose it.

I'm currently planning to check out the API and see if there's a way to use the export function present in Telegram Desktop in a custom client made exactly for this. If its possible, I would write a tool that can be used in conjunction with a systemd service or a cronjob or something to export preconfigured data.

But being a developer, I currently have many projects going, so please don't expect anything too soon.

**Edit:** Alright, there's an API to work with GDPR exports, so automation shouldn't be a problem. I'm not that experienced outside of .NET and Java development, so I could maybe write something solid with C# or Java and have it run through mono or jre. But since this is only run every now and then, I don't think it would be that much of a problem, right? Hi, thanks for your reply!  


One reason to back up chats may be to run automatic statistics on my chats (something I do manually, me and friends even have little competitions for who writes what and how much and so on); 

Another could be because I have contacts that oftentimes delete their messages and media while I'd like to keep them, and I'm sure I can find more reasons.

by GDPR extraction tool you mean the desktop export feature? 

I'm not sure how to script the  extraction tool, that is exactly what I'm trying to find out Hi,

you mean if it could be a problem in terms of too many requests? I don't think so, if like me you plan to run it once a day or such.

&#x200B;

Could you share the API docs for this exports? If it's a couple of simple calls I can write an R or Python script for it Ah I see. Yes I mean the desktop export feature but I'm not sure how to automate it either but the desktop client code is open source so it might give you an idea how it works.

With tdlib you can access everything a normal client can do so it would be possible to use it for exports I'm just not sure how much work it would be https://core.telegram.org/methods

Look at ""Working with GDPR exports"". About the problem: There's no real problem besides me not being confident in anything else than .NET and Java. ^^ I'm using Linux full-time, though and you were talking about cron jobs, so I asked if it would be OK for you to run something through mono or jre on a cron job. No TDLib doesn't have that built in. I see, I could use the TakeoutSession and eventually filter what I need with the chat ID and work my way from there. I'll post the script once done, if I have the time Ah, sure, I can cron anything =D not built in but you can gather all the histories you need, I guess that's just what the desktop client does Oh I am pretty sure it uses a designated API but I never checked"

If I receive a notification and read it from there (not in the app) and then open the app to reply I still see the animation which is unnecessary. Hoping for reacts next. Slide up? Didn't they always slide up? I guess I don't quite understand. I have the latest telegram and am not sure how it was before. Anyone have a side by side comparison? Fucking love Telegram but in the new iOS version they add a lots of bugs actually... Best thing since round chat bubbles I don’t understand either and I have used both platforms :(
Give us more detail or screenshot, sounds kinda interesting anyways [deleted] In the latest update they supposedly introduced some videoplayer changes I really didn't notice on Android... But I did notice how bad is in the new option to paint something on a photo, ¿haven't anyone noticed hat when you paint in a picture the paint doesn't stay in place? Uh, actually after getting used to it, I much preferred that this was gone... I haven't seen it in Telegram yet but I absolutely hate this animation in FB messenger. Sometimes I have to wait ages for all the old messages to slide past. Put my phone down and come back and see if they're done animating yet. Slide up with animation making it smoother.whatsapp for Android is still an eg of not smooth chatting,but the iOS counterpart is smoother.when you chat it doesn't just push up the messages,it slowly slide up with animation.go compare it If you have the old telegram,try typing message to anyone.(the message doesn't slowly slide up instead it just appear without any animation)the latest version fixed it.they even mention it themselves.when you go to their change log at (improved interface)it says ""send,edit, delete message with new animations"".if you use it frequently to chat, you should have noticed this little change 6.2 Yea 6.2, enjoy smooth chatting You can just turn off animations.just go to chat setting and do so. How old is your phone if you have to wait that long? Ew. Do we get the option to turn them off? But then these are all animations and not only this new one, right? Nothing to do with my phone (it's a Galaxy S10), the FB messenger app animates each message as it comes in. If I get a hundred messages, but I read them on my desktop, then when I open the app I have to wait for 100 messages to slide past.

It doesn't happen all the time though. Something to do with the chat heads. Settings>Chat Settings> Enable Animations No.  It's subtle and doesn't impact anything when you're regularly using it.  It's just aesthetic. Just turn it off and check if you like it .if you don't, then turn it back.(it should be for all animations) Oh!  I see what you mean now.  Yes, that happens to me too.  They have weird sync issues it feels like, cause that's annoying as hell. Thank you! Damn it.

Thanks, I just like a simple bare bones schtick. I don't like superfluous animations. If I wanted to be using Messenger, I'd just use Messenger. Yes, personally I prefer it keep it turned off but I liked animation it has when switching accounts on android mobile."

From there you can “reset database”. If that doesn’t help you might’ve so many chats cached it slows down the app. Thanks for the advice about the debug menu. Didn’t know this trick!

Unfortunately it didn’t help. I also tried reinstalling the app. I only have 6 chats and have had like 4 other chats. So I don’t think those 10 chats are slowing down my app 😢 

Is there more I can do? I don’t think so. Setting up iOS as a new device might help or it simply became more slow because of the ton of features. Thanks. Will try this 😁"

Where is Signal? When something is that famous be ready to lose all our privacy And? Philippines Haha yeah. r/jailbreak made me download Discord! I reckon they still use sms, but I'm not sure. Same in the States, they don't know what whatsapp is (which is good) or what Telegram is about. As far as I know, they either use IG to chat or if they are iPhone users, they go for iMessage. Yes it is! What do you mean? Is it still because of the documentary that was being shared on Telegram? Or are people sticking around to use it? I meant where is Signal Messenger? Which documentary? Link please There was a surge of Telegram download in PH due to their current political climate(i.e. mass creation of fake Facebook accounts used to target and threaten individuals who are vocal about their opposition to the govt's anti-terror bill). Because of fake news circulating around mainly on Facebook, Telegram has 'Philippines Coronavirus Updates channel' with verified information only. I dunno, bruh. Not familiar with it. Sorry.

Only users in the same group can see that you are in that group. ""Common Groups"" is a list visible on the profile of a user that lists which groups you both are in.

People who were notified about you joining Telegram will not see which groups or channels you are in. They too only know what groups you are in, if you are in the same as them.

People who have you in their contacts list or who you have in your contacts list will not be able to see this either. They too have to be in the same chat to see these shared chats. You can avoid this, please read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/gyeool/what_information_is_disclosed_to_others_in/ftcghqf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). So you're saying that under no circumstances can the Telegram users check the chat rooms, channels, groups, etc. And the only list of my groups, channels, and chat rooms they can check is the list of the groups, channels, and chat rooms that I and they all have in common, right? In any situation, whether the settings change or not, isn't it impossible for all users of the Telegram, including the person in the contact of my Telegram account, my Telegram friend, the user who received my sign-up notice, and the person who saved me in their own Telegram contact, to see a list of groups, chat rooms, and channels I joined? Exactly that, yes. They cannot see the complete list, but just those shared groups and channels. However, they can add you to a group or channel."

What information is disclosed to others in Telegram?;25;gyeool;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/gyeool/what_information_is_disclosed_to_others_in/;19;[deleted];2020-06-07 18:45:58;"In the Telegram settings you can set who has access to your phone number, your last seen date, your profile photo and even who can call you using voice calls, who can add you to groups and channels and when forwarded messages should link to your profile.

So I suggest you go through there first and set it up how you like it.

There is one thing to keep in mind, though, if you want to hide your phone number: If you have one person in your contacts and they have your phone number in their contacts, your profile and phone number will be linked for them. Otherwise they will just see your name. In order to protect your identiy and personal information you can setup telegram as follow:

* Settings->Privacy and Security->Phone Number (Nobody), Last seen & online (My contacts), Forwarded messages (My contacts), Voice calls (My contacts), Groups (My contacts);
* Settings->Privacy and Security->Phone number->Who can see my phone number (My contacts), Who can find my phone number (My contacts);
* Settings->Privacy and Security->Last seen & online (Nobody);
* Settings->Privacy and Security->Forwarded messages (My contacts);
* Settings->Privacy and Security->Profile photo (My contacts);
* Settings->Privacy and Security->Voice calls (My contacts);
* Settings->Privacy and Security->Groups & channels (My contacts);
* Settings->Username (choose a username);
* Optional: Settings->Privacy and Security->Two-Step Verification->Set Additional Password.

Telegram allows you to decide whether to synchronize your address book with their servers. Also, if you have already did it, you can delete your contacts from their servers: Settings->Privacy and Security->Contacts->Delete Synced Contacts and Sync Contacts.

You can prevent users from contacting you if they have your phone number and you don't have their phone number as long as you configure it: Settings->Privacy and Security->Phone Number->Nobody and My Contacts. It works even if you have the user's number in your address book, but you avoid synchronizing it with telegram servers.

If you setup a username, anyone can find you via global search. However, telegram asks you if you want to block and delete the chat or going on. Moreover, a non contact user cannot see nothing if you follow the previous setup. In the case of profile picture, the default setting is all and the option to select is my contact. If I keep the default settings, will all Telegram users, including those who have been notified of my subscription, my friends, and users who have joined the same channel, chat room, and group, be able to see my changed profile picture? I'm terribly sorry, but could you answer this question?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/hfgfpy/what_is_the_default_value_for_past_telegram_phone/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share Thank you for all those informations very helpful, I had two other questions :   


What happens if someone has me in their contacts and we chat on telegram and I delete synced contacts will I appear with my own name that I choosed ?   


Last question what happens if I uncheck ""Suggest Frequent Contacts"" ?   
( Settings->Privacy and Security-> Data Settings-> Contacts) The item Group & Channel is not visible. What is the setting for? If I choose only my contact number, can only the users who have been notified of my subscription and my Telegram friends see the changed profile picture? First question: yes.

Second question: this is the list of frequently contacts. Your contacts are sorted by name or last seen time. Did you setup the other settings as described? For me is My contacts. If you choose ""all"", everybody can see your profile picture. If you choose ""contacts"" only the people YOU have in YOUR contacts can see your profile picture. When trying to uncheck it, it says the following ""This will delete all data about the people you message frequently as well as the inline bots you are likely to use.  


So it means it's going to delete all data about the people I communicate frequently thing I don't want, I just want to have my privacy and keep the data There is no item called Group & Channels in the path setting>Privacy and Security you mentioned. Are you talking about the group? When I have been saved in the other person's Telegram contact but no one is in my Telegram contact, the other person can see my profile picture if I choose everyone, but if I choose my contact, will the other person not be able to see my profile picture? Telegram allows you to select the level of privacy. It is up to you to select your best compromise between privacy and usability. The setting is on desktop application. On android is called Groups. No, they won't be able to see it. It all depends on your contacts, not someone else's. Thank you so much for your good reply! Are you saying that even if the other person is notified that I joined and has my account in their contacts, they can never see my profile picture if the other person is not in my contacts? Yes."

I mean, Russia def can do BGP poisoning or something, but both of the IP's are in Germany and belong to Vodafone (Vodafone Kabel Deutschland GmbH to be more specific) Thanks 🙏 Haha. You should try ProtonVPN over using proxies. Proxies tend to have stupid advertisement channels and you always have to keep searching for a new proxy each time. Not worth the hassle IMO Yes. Miami, Singapore and Amsterdam. Also, the DC it depending on where the account was registered. All work now I've been stuck to 13.3 for months😁 battery is amazing and telegram never had any problem, until this last 6.2 update. Excessive battery draing and heat have now occurred :( My point is mainly the endless defense of Telegram's cloud encryption security. Data can't be accessed because it's distributed in various locations etc etc. Well, one data center in Europe goes down and down goes the service for everyone from Finland to Ireland to Spain to UAE. That would mean all those messages sit on that single data center.

I suppose this is the kind of result when people wake up one morning with their cloud data being hacked.

2025: ""Are you really criticizing Telegram for its servers being hacked. Many companies are hacked every week. Nothing special, just a hack.""

And yeah to answer your question no I'm not criticizing the downtime, shit happens. It's the stuff they could address now to prevent the shit show of 2025 but that they won't, that scares the living shit out of me.

To add: Downvoting doesn't change the fact every company gets hacked at some point. The question is, what words of comfort do the fan boys have then?

Don't get me wrong, I want Telegram to be a good app, why shouldn't people be allowed to demand better security architecture, it's really an embarrassment when you can't recommend very usable app like Telegram when everyone an their mother will immediately raise legitimate privacy concerns. must be pretty *hot* there. Sekundiere das als Brunnen Yes, that’s the point. It stays in Germany and can’t reach Russia. Thank you! Illegal try

Anyway stupid situation :/ I'm pretty sure they only have something like four data centers anyway. Supposedly the encryption keys are distributed across them, but I'm not so sure about messages and media. Each account is also associated with a single data center that it always connects to.

https://core.telegram.org/api/datacenter Well, yeah, server outages hurt. Maybe it wasn't even one data center. Not really sure what the alternative would be for a huge messaging app. >	That would mean all those messages sit on that single data center.

No, it does not mean that. It’s possible, but an outage does not unambiguously reveal the specific architecture of Telegram’s services as you are suggesting. It is. (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ Der ist mal richtig gut! Did they still had servers in Russia? I mean, the service was banned/blocked there. Well it makes no sense to have key in multiple data centers in one piece.

>Supposedly the encryption keys are distributed across them

Let's say we're on Neatherlands server room. The server program receives the message from me, it then stores the message encrypted on the drive. Where is the encryption key located when the encryption function is called? Does the NL server contact server in US and Singapore to fetch parts of keys to encrypt that message before its stored on their server? Or does the key sit in NL server's RAM? I don't see how outage over multiple data centers is any better in this context. That would imply even greater weak point in the architecture handling availability. So why isn't Telegram's architecture public? That's why I'm saying supposedly. They've never explained exactly what they mean by that statement. I'm pretty skeptical of it myself. I'd hope there's *something* in place however, because sooner or later with their lack of cooperation with governments it's a possibility one of the datacenters will get raided, and at that point with physical access and state resources anything could happen even if they are encrypting data (eg cold boot attack or similar). What would be an alternative? Aren't data centers the only way these huge services can operate? I cannot answer that, but I can say that even if they shared more about their infrastructure, you’d still have to trust that it was implemented as described. I'm less concerned about any raid because full disk encryption prevents physical access to the drive content. Cold-boot attacks against server motherboards are insanely hard considering how hard it it to access two dozen RAM sticks in the motherboard, and dumping terabytes of RAM very fast isn't easy either: You have seconds after freezing the RAM, even less with modern low-voltage DDR4.

I'm more concerned about remote exploitation that takes over the machine. Privilege escalation exploits allows running code in privileged state, and when CPU is executing program in privileged state, it can access the entire RAM (computer organization and architecture 101), including the section that contains the database encryption key. After that, the database is open to read however the attacker likes.

But yeah, given the limitations of how encryption can be done on a computer, the statement definitely needs clarification. There is no distributed low-latency encryption. Also, there is no way to only keep key in split state in multiple data centers, if you need it as whole in one data center to encrypt a database entry. Just redundancy, multiple locations the client can connect when it doesn't reach the servers. Also, adding E2EE to protect against the hack doesn't require removing data centers. See e.g. Signal. Indeed, but at least that would show it's possible in theory to provide the advanced distributed encryption key storage technologies that require multiple warrants, that they claim to use.

So far there's nothing and I'm growing more and more concerned. You're right, and that's a good point about the amount and type of RAM in servers. There's lots of possible attack vectors they can pretty much nullify whatever encryption they have in place for at-rest data. Having physical access however opens up even more possible vectors beyond the public facing APIs and services, such as vulnerable on-board OOB management or vulnerable services running over a private network between servers. Having both state resources and physical access is highly likely to result in game over and access to data regardless of attempts at mitigation. Although yes, the possibility for a remote attack to expose data is also very real and a huge concern. There's a massive incentive given the amount of data accumulating. Ah, you mean having backup servers that people get rerouted to if the ""core"" ones are down? (Sorry if I'm saying this the wrong way, not too techy.) Yeah, that'd definitely help. OOB management is a great point, I'm not sure what the authorization mechanisms are but I'd imagine Telegram is renting their infrastructure and not maintaining their own infra, meaning the ultimate control is with the IaaS provider and not them. These of course have their own vulnerabilities, not sure if they're connected to the Internet but I wouldn't find it hard to believe.

There's also the possibility there's a middle-box that might be compromised to scan messages before they hit the persistence. Yeah, but these issues are usually resolved really quickly, [https://outage.report/telegram](https://outage.report/telegram) shows issues with availability are almost resolved. My issue is more with the encryption, it's an accident waiting to happen, and it's becoming more dangerous by a minute because the servers are just accumulating that user data. Probably close to a 10 million messages were stored there while you read this message. I'm just really, really scared for everyone."

Who gets notified when I join telegram?;31;gxrhht;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/gxrhht/who_gets_notified_when_i_join_telegram/;34;[deleted];2020-06-06 16:59:46;"Whoever has you number in their contacts >And is the notification sent unconditionally regardless of my will?

Yes. They really need to get rid of this feature. I know this might be annoying, but your contacts could always see that you are on telegram by going to their contacts in telegram. It is the same in whatsapp. This is good. Now you're reachable by this medium and people know that now Should be removed due to privacy. As a special case, I recently received ""You joined Telegram!"" notification.

It turned out someone got my retired/recycled number and joined Telegram. The number was long gone but still in my contacts under my name. If we already had telegram on phone and we join on desktop with the same number will they get notified back ? [deleted] Even if I don't have the other person's phone number, does the other person get a notification if he or she has my phone number? My wife gets notifications for my contacts that join. We have no idea why. I know that the sign-up notification is sent when you allow the contact authority, but is it sent as soon as you sign up regardless of the permission? They never will, because it's the feature that allows Telegram to grow. I'm also of this opinion, but there are people who don't like to be reachable, or rather, they only want to be reachable by a restricted number of people. In this case you just have no choice but to use a different phone number (maybe buy another SIM card, or use a VoIP number if it's still allowed) No. No. This won't get **you** notified of your contacts when **they** join Telegram. Not vice versa Yes, it does notify the other person.

I was notified for one of my contact who didn't had my number, and was also notified for a person who had my number but I didn't. Probably same email or you have synchronized contacts. If you go to the settings (on Android at least), tap many times on a version number, it will enable debug menu. Make a long tap after it and click ""Reset Imported Contacts"". Probably she once logged into Telegram from a device of yours and your contacts got syncronized. If she goes to menu>contacts she can see all their Telegram contacts and she can delete your contacts. Or, for an automatic setting, there should be an option in the privacy settings to delete all syncronized contacts, and if she does so while leaving the toggle for ""sync contacts"" on, all the contacts she has on their phone will stay on Telegram. Yes, it has nothing to do with permissions *you* give. People that have your number in *their* Telegram contacts will get a notification no matter what. It's Telegram informing them that one of their contacts joined Telegram. Basically nothing you can do about it, other than sign up with a phone number that you never gave to anyone. Is the chat room where the subscription notification arrives the same as the chat room where the phone number authentication code arrives when I leave the Telegram? Not the same email, my email is not on her device. Those contacts are not in her device (if you go to phone/contacts they are not there) Both on iOS, but thank you! We will check it out. Thanks! I'm really sorry, but could you tell me the details of the notification? I'm sorry to bother you... It says ""X joined Telegram!"" (where X is replaced by the name they have for you in their contacts), and a chat with you is automatically created (but again, you won't notice unless they actually message you in that chat). What happens to the notification if I delete the Telegram account? The notification is not something that can be changed, the phone can't make people unlearn you joined Telegram. The only thing that happens is that people won't see your profile picture anymore, your name will become ""Deleted Account"" in any chat with you, and obviously people won't be able to message you. You mean my account disappears (delete) from the other person's friend list. And the name of the chat room (in many messengers, the name of the 1:1 chat room is determined by the name of the other person. I don't know about Telegram...), the caller name of all the chat I sent will be changed to the deleted account? I'm really sorry, but does ""the phone can't make people unlearn you Joined Telegram"" mean that I can't hide my subscription to Telegram if I'm already notified to other people because I can never delete or change the subscription notification already sent to the other person? Yes. What does that even mean? I don't understand what's your issue.

You join Telegram. People who have your phone number in their contacts will see that your phone number joined Telegram. That's it. Simple as that.

If you change your phone number and you tell Telegram, it will trasfer all the chats to the new phone number. If you delete your account people won't be able to see you anymore (but will retain a copy of your messages if you don't explicitly remove them; and obviously you won't be able to use Telegram in any way).

In any case, if people get the notification ""John joined Telegram"", it's done, you can't remove this information from their minds. If you want to hide from people, your only hope is using a phone number you never gave anyone. Thank you very much for your answer. Recently, there was a personal problem with using Telegram...I am using a translator because it is not an English speaking country. Can someone else or someone who has been notified of my subscription check the chat room, group etc. that I am subscribed to or active?"

Well... what if someone reports me again in my group? 3rd report and my account is restricted forever right? I have not been doing anything different to what I have been doing the last 2 years. Someone is ill intended and wants to hurt the group. One of our admins is restricted as well. It is a targetted attack. if you can't appeal, then you aren't restricted. so nothing to sorry about. the moderators will review the report and restrict your account based on the messages that were reported.  Not really , I am restricted. I can not pm people who are not in my contacts. Can I be reported for spam on a group where I am the owner? if you’re restricted you can appeal it via the bot. sure. and that goes for anyone in the group. 

but if you don’t send spam messages, then you won’t have an issue. I tried. I do not have any appeal option there unless I am missing something.Happy to provide screenshots with what I am seeing. There is no appeal option We are a crypto group. I post articles and tweets everyday for educational purposes and I have been doing that for the last 2 years. Someone found the opportunity to mark that as spam to hurt the group basically and Telegram approved it. This is my “spam”. if you weren’t spamming, then why were you restricted 🤔 moderators review all reports before making a decision I guess it depends on everyone's definition on spam. Would posting tweets or articles be considered spam ? how exactly does telegram define spam within groups ? Plus, they did that to the other admins of the group as well."

 The admin group has access to your id, so he always recognizes you They likely have your phone number saved and see that it's you by just looking at the number.

Next time try setting the number visibility to nobody in the privacy settings. Not necessarily. The id is not supposed to be public knowledge. It's an identifier, but users are not supposed to have access to it. With a userbot or custom clients you can of course find it out and use it. Even when I delete my account and reset it?

honest question: what are the facts that are base for people arguing that Signal is better than Telegram?;57;gx51c0;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/gx51c0/honest_question_what_are_the_facts_that_are_base/;97;I am honestly trying to understand the motivations for that claim. Is Telegram less secure than Signal?;2020-06-05 16:56:32;"1-to-1 chat encryption by default. Otherwise Signal is not as feature-rich as Telegram. [deleted] Telegram is not less secure, at least there's no solid evidence to say it is.

Telegram offers secure end-to-end encryption, but only in secret chats. Regular chats aren't encrypted. There's nothing really to say that they are encrypted. With Signal, the encryption is on by default.

Also, with Signal, both the client and server code is open source. Telegram's clients (iOS, Windows, Android) are open source, but their server code is not.

Telegram has been tested by Iran, China, the US, and Russia. Each of them have asked Telegram to expose the chats of their members (you and me) to their oversight, and they were all told to go pound sand. It's why the Russian developer fled Russia. He's now operating out of Dubai. The UAE isn't much better than those four, and he'll probably have to leave the UAE sooner than later.

Signal really hasn't been tested like that; however, a lot of people are saying to use it. Privacy experts, governments in more privacy-respecting countries, and recently the CEO of Twitter.

Honestly, I'd say just install both of them. That's what I've done. Also, this is /r/Telegram. Ask over in /r/Privacy for a more objective answer. Also why doesn't telegram just invite top crypto companies to examine their code and sign NDAs. Have them take a look at it before making it public. Hell have another company or two do the same thing. [deleted] Both solutions have their pros and cons. Over the years I have spent using both I have learn to trust and use both! Personally I use Signal as my default SMS texting app and Telegram for all other messaging needs. I have found that it is a little easier to convince people to download and use Telegram. Below is a list of personal pros and cons for both solutions.  


Signal Pros:

* Supported on iOS, Android, and PC
* Uses open source encryption algorithms
* Supported by Edward Snowden the defacto American privacy and security advocate
* End to end encryption by default when both users have Signal
* Uses a security pin to stay active and is required to continue use and/or register your phone number (new feature)

Signal Cons:

* Unable to make default texting app in iOS
* In theory the security that Signal offers is compromised if other signal users you text are saved in your contacts
* Messages sent to people who do not have signal are not encrypted (technically there is no way to encrypt because there is no way to exchange keys)
* Depends on a good data connection when on mobile
* Poor quality phone calls and/or text messages on mobile when data connection is weak
* If your contacts have signal they will receive a notification when you install the app

Telegram Pros:

* Supported on iOS, Android, and PC
* They offer a bug bounty
* End to end encryption is offered only on mobile via Secret Chat
* Telegram has a dead man's switch built into the settings which has configurable time lengths
* Configurable user names that can be used to keep your phone number private and can be used to contact you instead of your phone number

Telegram Cons:

* End to end encryption is only supported on mobile
* In theory the security that Telegram offers is compromised if you use your real name 
* Chats that do not use end to end encryption (secret chat) are stored on Telegram servers
* Telegram does save regular messages that do not use end to end encryption on their servers (this is used to sync across devices)
* If all devices lose access to Telegram then you will not be able to receive your ""secret code""  because it is sent to you via Telegram
* If you do not turn off contact sharing then Telegram will automatically share your phone number and save contacts of people who have telegram and and your phone number saved in their phone

&#x200B;

Ultimately I do my best to promote the use of both apps because encryption is important. As some redditor already said once... *""Signal users are the vegans of the messaging world.""* ""Better"" is very open-ended. What's better for me, might not be better for you, and definitely not better for e.g. Snowden.

Signal is more private than Telegram, because all chats are end-to-end-encrypted by default. There is no non-E2EE option. This also works across multiple devices. Telegram's default chats are not E2EE. While this may not be an issue for the majority of people, if your life depends on the server (and those who have access to it) not having access to the plain text messages, then that is an issue. Telegram has 'secret' chats but functionality is crippled if you use those - no multiple devices, no backups.

Telegram is certainly more feature-rich than Signal. Very customisable, scheduled send, proxied link previews that work for all sites, instant view on many links (but then of course the Telegram server knows about every link you visit), they all make for a beautiful user experience. If the features it offers are more important than privacy, then Telegram is a better one for you. Signal uses a well known, tested and trusted encryption algorithm whereas Telegram devs just felt like making their own which is kida strange To everyone that answered so far: thanks!!! Your are being very helpful! -	Default 1vs1 encryption, so you know every conversation is encrypted in Signal, no matter what.
-	Encrypted GROUPS. Telegram dont have it.
-	No-metadata policy. Signal doesnt store almost anything about you (only acc date creation and last connected date is stored) or who you contact. This is HUGE.


https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-as-the-world-moves-forward/ both use a phone number for authorization - there is no security Try Signal, compare and tell us. Thanks! So... If we choose to use ""private/secret chats"" in Telegram we are as protected as we would be using Signal, right? Thanks! >1-to-1 chat encryption by default

Not quite. *Everything* in Telegram is encrypted by default. That is, nothing is transmitted in clear text. The difference between Signal and Telegram is that to get *end-to-end encryption* in Telegram, you need to start a secret chat. Everything else is still encrypted. Thanks for being so helpful. What I understood is that they can be as safe as the other (since we are talking about one to one secret chats). In groups that are no guarantees that data is protected the same way. > No need of a phone to use Tg on a PC. 

Are you implying that there is a way to create a TG account without having to use a phone number or do you mean that you can create an account using ""throw away"" phone number from some web service to activate an account? Everyone hates on Telegram for their proprietary encryption but I've yet to hear about it being breached. Also the Hong Kong protesters were using it to communicate and organize with other protesters.  Seems pretty secure to me if Russia and China can't even gain access to the messages on it. regular chats are also encrypted, just not end-to-end, I thought? Very complete and strong answer! Thanks! I am an avid telegram user but every time i find myself in the position to explain to friends that Telegram is better and safer than WhatsApp. Now they are arguing that if I really care about security I should be using signal because that is what is really safe...

The answers here will help me to explain better and also to learn more about the matter. Dumb question but doesn't telegram keeping their source code private mean it can't be reverse engineered and cracked? Doesn't open source give hackers a blueprint?

Plus there's all this talk about sinking and what can and cannot be synced. Which I don't get. Telegram says it can't sync everything yet signal and iMessage do and their end-to-end encrypted. Probably being pedantic here, but the server code shouldn't matter. If the conversation is E2E, the server is just acting as a relay, so the code shouldn't matter. Also, you have no way of checking which code the server is running.

About the clients being open source, yes true, but telegram sometimes lacks on this aspect, at least for the android app. > Honestly, I'd say just install both of them. That's what I've done.

I've also done that. [deleted] That would be an interesting solution to end with the criticism... Thanks! Excellent reply. Thank you. Personally I am not bothered by the fact that I can not set on app as default text messaging, but I get it. 

The security part is very clear for me. GreatQ >Chats that do not use end to end encryption (secret chat) are stored on Telegram servers

Which is catastrophic if the server-side data is ever compromised. Oh wait, too late [https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/06/24/darknet-forum-leaks-telegram-database-with-millions-of-russian-users-information](https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/06/24/darknet-forum-leaks-telegram-database-with-millions-of-russian-users-information) Nice comparison! A couple of corrections:

>Telegram Cons:

>* Chats that do not use end to end encryption (secret chat) are stored on Telegram servers
>* Telegram does save regular messages that do not use end to end encryption on their servers (this is used to sync across devices)

You're listing the same thing twice

>* If all devices lose access to Telegram then you will not be able to receive your ""secret code""  because it is sent to you via Telegram

It's also sent via SMS. I believe you can even get it by phone call. Hahaha! Haven’t heard this before. Seems appropriate. Hmmm I see. I thought every messaging app should develop its own. Maybe this is the reason people do not trust Telegram as being so secure as the other. Because that way you can be sure-ish that there are no planted vulnerabilities in it. You can still put 2FA, so you get simplicity and extra security. Since using an email is broken as well. Just put 2 FA and voilà. What would you recommend? Why are you being downvoted? Even with 2FA sim swap attacks make breaking an account trivial, almost. I am not able to compare. I am just an user. I have no specific technical skills for this. The problem here is that defaults matter. Yes it is convenient to have synced chats on all my devices, but it's not very secure, as you are relying on a third party server to hold a copy of all your messages.

This is a though sub to ask this question has you have a lot of users that have a fanboy mentality. I am a user myself, would recommend Telegram, but I am aware of the potential security/privacy issues around it. yep, basically. Telegram uses its own encryption method tho. They said it couldn't be broken. We have no proof but we have no doubt either. yes. From that point of view, even Facebook is private. I'd like to know the answer to this too. If you can just use some website to create the account with a fake number No, you have to use your number to register, but you can use username and avoid to upload your contacts to telegram servers. [deleted] The point is that we don't know. Hackers and states sit on 0-days for years. Once you've used it, you've burned it. The fact that it hasn't been hacked yet doesn't mean jack shit about how secure it is. Yes.  The man is wrong saying that regular chats are not encrypted. Right, regular chats are encrypted but not end to end is the exact controversy that is caused in the security community. The algorithm that Telegram uses is proprietary and therefore the source code can't be scrutinized by the security community to officially say it is secure. Also the problem with not having end to end encryption is that if Telegram's servers are ever compromised a lot of chats and information could be leaked. Between China, Russia, and USA its probably not a question of ""if"" but ""when"" it happens anyone that thinks they are protected is screwed. >regular chats are also encrypted, just not end-to-end, I thought?

When the server has the key for the encrypted messages, we can assume they are not encrypted... Telegram is absolutely better than WhatsApp. I would say that WhatsApp is owned by Facebook and that's why I'm not using it (that's why *I'm* not using it, anyway) but that I can be reached on either Telegram or Signal. That is to say, if I am in your contacts, either app you install, I will appear in as I have it installed, so the choice is yours which you use to communicate with me.

FWIW, I proposed this before leaving Facebook and not a single person took me up on it. I had to come to terms with the fact that none of my ""Facebook friends"" respected my privacy. And that nothing of true value was lost on that day. When comparing Telegram to WhatsApp, WhatsApp isn’t that secure. The moment you backup your chat history to iCloud or Google drive, you lose that encryption. There are disadvantages to open source and that may be one of them. There are valid arguments for each.

The technical questions about syncing would have to be answered by someone else. I only have a basic understanding of encryption and such. I know for encrypted communication to work, there have to be keys, and I'm **guessing** that syncing with desktop means the desktop has to have the keys and that makes it less secure, whereas pure phone to phone means the keys are harder for bad actors (hackers etc) to get. But I could be wrong. Hopefully you get a better answer.

At the level of privacy I need, Telegram is fine.

One thing I would suggest doing if you really want Telegram to be more secure, is get a phone number not tied to you. Find a place selling a burner phone where your face will not be on camera. Pay cash for it. Use it (it has to be able to text) to activate the number on Telegram. Or use one of those free texting services, make sure it can't be connected to you, and use that. Then get a Telegram username that is somewhat random, and give that out. My Telegram is tied to my phone number and uses my real name, but it's only for family and friends. I'm not doing any shady shit, it's just conversation we'd prefer to keep away from the ears of Facebook and Google. * The server side code is closed source. So both your replies don't work.

Sign NDA, show them the code (not public), audit it, fix what needs to be fixed, then release that code to the public. (Since they keep saying they are gonna make it public ""eventually"") For me personally it is about organization then again I rarely use Apple products. I don't like the limitations that put on their device if you don't void the warranty. I'd want to add two more cons against Signal:

- No third party clients
- Need to link a phone number
- Depends on Google Play Services No. By making your own algorithm you're creating suspicions that there may be planted vulnerabilities in it. The point of using a well known and widely used algorithm is to use one that many security experts have analyzed already my friends using telegram, but nobody care about secret chats... IDK. Here in Russia, privacy is rather arbitrary.  Under torture, people themselves will sign whatever they ask. I see. Security is always dependable on us users too right? The way you dismiss convenience in favour of security bothers me. Having all my chats synced across my devices and a permanent ""forever history"" is far more important to me than knowing my chats with my friends and family are end-to-end encrypted.

When did end-to-end encryption became this elusive and must-have feature that everyone suddenly has to have in their instant messenger for it to be acceptable?! Are these people really as cautious about all their other online activity (emails, browsing etc)? I highly doubt it. 

I'll take the option to have a ""secret chat"" if I need to (can't imagine when that might be tbh) over a forced default that severely limits the usefulness and enjoyment of the software. Nobody has a problem with FB Messenger or Google Hangouts storing messages in the cloud though.

Edit: I mean this cynically. Correction - telegram stores incomplete chunks of your data across multiple servers in multiple countries, including your encryption keys. 

This is colossally different to what all other services do. The ramifications of this should be self evident but are detailed in the faq. Signal does use its own encryption though, which is the part I never got. Both apps use their own encryption but only one gets criticized? And the encryption method in Signal is in any way better than Telegram's? I suppose no one can prove this, right? [deleted] Telegram created the protocol which is the very definition of what proprietary is. 

 [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18558947#:\~:text=protocol%20developed%20for%20the%20Telegram,Mobile%20Transport%20Protocol](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18558947#:~:text=protocol%20developed%20for%20the%20Telegram,Mobile%20Transport%20Protocol) 

&#x200B;

If its been made open source for the security community to scrutinize more then that is news to me. Do you have a link to where the source code is posted? the communication between device and server is encrypted. precisely! I am not using WA just because it is owned by FB and, therefore, not trustable. Period. [deleted] Didn’t know about the google services... I would disagree with you. Third party clients by nature can compromise the security that is offered. Take Telegram for example, there are 3rd party clients that are offered but because of the way software works this means that your messages are being passed through their software which could have other servers before it hits Telegram servers.   


You also need a phone number to create a telegram account. I don't consider this to be a con because phone numbers can be easily spoofed and/or created for anonymity purposes.  


Signal does not depend on Google Play Services and is a misconception of how the app works. You are actually able to use the app without Google Play services just fine -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/wiki/faq#wiki\_signal\_android](https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/wiki/faq#wiki_signal_android)   


In addition to all that if you truly want to keep your identity anonymous on a throw away phone that uses Android and do not want to sign in you can always download the APK from Signal at  [https://signal.org/android/apk/](https://signal.org/android/apk/)  and install the app manually. Security is dependable on good software too, but yes, some of it depends on us as users. You are wording it the wrong way my friend. Different people have different needs, and as I told before, defaults matter.

Yes, you have nothing to hide I see, so may I ask for your passwords and banking details? May I ask for a copy of all your messages? No? Why?

End-to-end encryption is a must have nowadays. As more and more data is being generated and stored(this is key) forever, we don't know when, or by who it may be used, or even if it may be used against yourself. Being cautious about what you do and share online is key on this day and age.

About your last part you are missing the point. There are implementations that could have the same features and still be end-to-end encrypted, and this is what we are asking, or at least, some of us are. I do, and that's part of why I switched to telegram no one is saying those apps are touting themselves as a privacy and security-first messenger I do, so? I pretty much do, thats why i use telegram and signal When I say Telegram stores the messages and the keys on their end, I am not worried about state actors, as so far, Telegram has been pretty resilient about those.

However, bad actors can hack servers and have access to it all. YES! This is one of the reasons I asked the question. It doesn’t. Without diving to deep, both apps use their own protocols. In cryptography, there are primitives, basically the building blocks of encryption, and protocols, the plan on how to combine the building blocks.

Signal uses well established primitives in its encryption protocol. Telegram on the other hand uses at least one self-made primitive (the key derivation function or KDF), which in cryptography is a big no no. Signal's protocol is considered the gold standard and is fully open source (which means that all of the code is free to look at). It's been analyzed and reviewed several times by experts and no major flaws have been found. Even Facebook uses it for Whatsapp.

Telegram's is proprietary and written by a mathematician, not a cryptographer. Additionally, the Telegram server software is not open source, so you can't really analyze how it functions.

This is all besides the fact that Telegram claims that they can't do end-to-end encryption for group chats, yet Whatsapp end-to-end encrypts everything and their groups can have up to 256 people (nobody needs a 200,000-person group chat). Signal doesn't have a group limit, though message delivery time is affected by large numbers of group members (which they improve with each update).

Telegram also claims that if they end-to-end encrypt everything, your phone needs to be on and connected to the internet in order to chat from your computer (like Whatsapp does). But that's not true; I use Signal in addition to Whatsapp, and Signal doesn't need your phone to be on after you register your computer. The only limitation is that previous messages are not synced over to the newly-added device. [You can see how that works here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/diyncu/how_does_signal_implement_multidevice_e2e/f409my4/)

So my opinion, as someone who uses Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp:

- **Signal is the safest, but least convenient (private):** Relatively few ""normal"" people use it (but more are now, at least in the US, due to ongoing protests). It's trying to become more user-friendly by letting you to react to things (like FB Messenger) using any emoji. It also has GIF search and sticker support, and also supports disappearing messages (which guarantee they disappear on all devices in the chat). They also collect the least metadata on you; basically they only store what is necessary in order to provide you with service. They don't store your messages at all; you're in charge of maintaining/backing them up. You can see what information they were able to turn over when they received a subpoena in 2016 [here](https://signal.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/) (first PDF). It was the user's registration date and the last time they were online. That's it. No chats. No record of who they spoke to. No record of what they said. Nothing.

-----------

- **Whatsapp is the second safest, and the most convenient (balanced):** Pretty much everyone uses this. I'm in the US, where it's considered to be ""not that popular"", yet the majority of my chats are done using it. I don't really need to explain the features, since pretty much everyone knows them. But I will say that despite being owned by Facebook, it uses Signal's open-source End to End encryption. Just like with Signal, you can verify who you're talking to by comparing keys or scanning QR codes. And it also tells you when someone's encryption code (identity) changed, meaning they're using a new device. Again, yes, it is owned by Facebook, but they have no idea what you're saying because *everything* is end to end encrypted. Even Signal has defended it: *[""We believe that WhatsApp remains a great choice for users concerned with the privacy of their message content.""](https://signal.org/blog/there-is-no-whatsapp-backdoor/)*. If you really care your privacy while using Whatsapp, you should disable cloud backups and use iTunes encrypted backups (for iPhones) or encrypt the backup file yourself (Android). 

-----------

- **Telegram is the least safe, and is convenient as a Whatsapp alternative (the most features):** Again, I don't really need to spell out the feature set, but I will say that to me it looks better than both Signal and Whatsapp. And although it doesn't have video chat (yet), it somewhat makes up for it with things like Channels and a 1.5GB file transfer limit. Obviously the hallmark feature is ""Cloud Chats"" and the ability to have truly independent multi-device synchronization/communication (which is convenient, but not safe). I find it fine for everyday conversations, but I don't trust it for private conversations. I don't care that it's not US-based. I don't care that the founder was exiled from Russia (though he has kind of a shady past). The fact of the matter is that your chats are stored in a closed-source server that no one can verify is safe. That wouldn't be a big deal if your chats were end-to-end encrypted using a known, vetted protocol (like how Whatsapp uses Signal's E2EE protocol). But the decryption keys are stored **on their servers**, which is like locking your front door and then keeping the key in the lock. In contrast, yeah, Facebook (Whatsapp) know who I'm talking to and when, but they have absolutely no idea what I'm saying. If someone were to hack Telegram's servers, or if Telegram decided to cooperate with a third party (regardless of what they promise), your messages are totally readable.

My suggestion is, use Whatsapp or Telegram for your normal everyday conversations, fine. But have Signal installed just in case and use it for private stuff (protests, discussing potentially illegal things, criticizing the government, etc). Even with Secret Chats, I don't trust Telegram because of all the stuff I mentioned above. If they switched to Signal's protocol and end to end encrypted everything, I'd be all over it. If they at least switched to it for Secret Chats (and added group support), I think it could easily beat out both Whatsapp and even Signal at its own game. They could absolutely do Secret Group Chats, if they limited the number of people who could be in it. Again, nobody *needs* 200,000-user support for Group Chats. The reason is that one is open source the other isnt that is whats beeing criticised. yeah, until someone actually breaks the thing FAQ

They aren't claiming it cannot be broken, but this is almost like that [deleted] Which is true for any messaging app on  Android and iOS these days. Used to be different, but now it is nothing special or unique

See here: https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/previewing-android-p.html?m=1 You sound confused. Please read thru some of these comments and you'll find your answer. Ta >I would disagree with you. Third party clients by nature can compromise the security that is offered.

It's bot good for security, but I absolutely consider it a pro to have third party clients available, and to be able to make my own. Sure thing! I meant that given that the software part is not an issue (is already been taken care of), the human part is very important. Also, on the point about wanting my banking password....  This is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. In my experience, the people demanding e2ee are the ones that think that without it, their internet banking password is in jeopardy. We're talking about security in an instant messenger; not security in general. Keep your passwords secure; never transmit them over IM.  Or if you must, just use a secret chat! That's what it is there for.  No one is saying that people should be careless with security but these are not concerns the average user needs to have in terms of IM security and this is why Telegram has chosen functionality over limitation. ""different people have different needs"".  This is basically my point. You might prioritize e2e and you may have your reasons, but not everyone shares your views. However, with Telegram, people like you and I can both have our cake and eat it. 

Unfortunately, if Telegram ""defaulted"" e2e, then by default we give up other creature comforts that are important to other people (you seem to think this isn't the case and I'd be interested to hear about these other implementations you mentioned). 

This has nothing to do with defaults and everything to do with options. Ah, okay, they both use own protocols but only one uses its own primitives. This clears it up, thanks. Is it bad to use your own self-made primitive simply because it's untested? How do new standards (would that be the right word?) for primitives come to pass? [deleted] *Editing to better reflect your edits...*  


Proprietary in my mind is not defined by someone that made something.  In my mind proprietary has always been the creation of something that is kept, maintained, and owned by an individual and/or company. Typically the methods of how to produce this product is kept secret.  I admit that this is not the exact definition but this is how I have always understood the meaning of the word.

Am I missing something that you see? Because when I look through all I see repositories for the clients, I don't see any libraries for implementing MTProto. All I see are detailed explanations of how MTProto functions and how to call out to the API so you can use MTProto. Here's my dissection about the problems [https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cxqf9b/messaging\_app\_telegram\_moves\_to\_protect\_identity/eyn5ptw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cxqf9b/messaging_app_telegram_moves_to_protect_identity/eyn5ptw/) No, honestly I am mostly worried about security, probably not my own, but future generations.

I have been careless stupid and young, I have shared things over the internet, being it views, being it photos. On the day and age where, again, storage is cheap and things are being stored forever, why should we compromise future generations security when we have the technology to protect them? Wire, Signal, Whatsapp, this are defaults that have multiple device support with e2e.

I would agree with you if it was a call about features vs encryption, but it is not. And if it is not, why keep pushing cloud chats instead of implementing e2e for multiple devices? Yes, designing cryptographic primitives is a field that is very hard to get right, even tiny mistakes can render your whole encryption scheme vulnerable and, hence, useless. Testing is extremely important, which is why people usually opt for established and well tested primitives that have been used out in the wild for a while.

New standards are sometimes submitted as part of a competition, such as AES. They will get reviewed by experts, people at the NIST, etc. This is not correct. Telegram tries to be transparent about the use of MTProto but the source code as far as I know is not available anywhere to be scrutinized. Only the source code to the clients are available on Github, that is a huge difference. 

Please provide a link to the source code of MTProto that shows that the security community can scrutinize and contribute to it. The Telegram Apps are open source but the Server Software isnt. They even say in their FAQ that they are not fully open source. [deleted] This gives the impression that telegrams protocols haven't been scrutinized or tested - this is incorrect. Many have raised concerns since its inception, rightly so, but only one (that I've come across) independent audit supposedly found any flaws - it was later redacted (with an apology, from memory).

But certainly their protocols haven't seen the same volume of use and testing and reviews as the more established ones, I just wanted to give your otherwise accurate explanation a more rounded perspective.

But in addition, given the creator's history, motivation behind the app, and the regions where it is most popular, it most certainly has a lot of interested and powerful parties doing everything they can to break the protocols. Yet so far (as we know) that hasn't happened. Cool, thank you for a detailed reply! I saw a lot of stuff about encryption being talked about in threads about these apps but your answers are the first time I think I actually see the difference and what people criticize. [deleted] No apology needed! I took your comments as a being part of a constructive and healthy conversation. I appreciate how you called me out for my improper use of certain words.

I stand corrected that their code is open source but during my research I am finding some additional information that is making me re-think their security. Will I stop using Telegram? Probably not, I don't really have anything that I need to truly keep secure. Thank for making that important distinction, its one that I missed.

I will have to take a closer look at their app. Last I looked all I could see was how to call out to the API."

>Video calls in 2020 are much like messaging in 2013. There are apps that are either secure or usable, but not both. We'd like to fix that, and we will focus on bringing you secure group video calls in 2020. ... or that it can also send in-app recorded videos. In the mean time, audio calls seem completely broken here. Incoming calls now only ring on my phone, not my laptops, and fail to connect. And outgoing calls fail similarly according to feedback from pals. This is since the recent rounds of updates. Calls.... but they said to me that it will be no bullshit messaging and they will never change it. And what we have now is everything what I personally did not like five years ago in other messaging services. Yes, I'm aware of this. FaceTime, WhatsApp, and even VK have end-to-end encrypted video calls. What’s not so secure about a video call? It seems like a trivial thing to do. I thought the same thing but isn't *WebRTC* a protocol about real-time communication? (The RtcConnection.h file and the TgVoipWebrtcCustom directory)

Please, correct me if I'm wrong and I'll just delete this. What do you mean? You don't need to use the feature if you don't want to, and I imagine video calling will be under the chat menu the same way normal calls are, or as something that can be optionally turned on in a call already in progress. It is not an invasive feature or one which fundamentally changes how the app works. I can maybe understand resistance to features like stories, but video calling for an app focused on communication does not seem like a bullshit feature. [deleted] Yes, you are correct. The fact that this is in a directory named `TgVoipWebrtcCustom` strongly suggests that this is indeed related to video calls, and not an existing video-related functionality in the app. Mainly with this pandemic stuff, video calls are really needed stuff, my mother as a music teacher uses Whatsapp's video call quite often when her student does not have Skype.

Video Editor, Animated Photos, Better GIFs and More;127;gwlwvo;Telegram;https://telegram.org/blog/video-editor-gifs;22;;2020-06-04 20:27:33;">And that's it for today. Enjoy making post-ironic memes with the new  tools while we go back to the dungeons and continue working on  you-know-what (and not only that). The new send animation on Android is so subtly eye pleasing. How many people do you think got excited seeing ""Video"" at the start of the title only to then see it followed with ""Editor""? Not complaining, though, I'm amazed that people on Twitter expected video calls to come this month, they were only announced at the end of April, lol. I was hoping for a feature to add animated stickers to images, just a few days ago. Cool they added that. Very welcome update. Did they change gif search engine? The new animations on Android are pretty slick. So much better than WhatsApp ☺️🤪 We wish if telegram add video call support I switched to this from telegram X to check out the new animations and they are great but... Am I going crazy or does it force apple emoji style on Android and you can't change it? If so that **blows**. I think vidéo call it's for next update July one's I want to change the color of text but keep black borders. Hopefully soon. *You-know-what* 😏 No they didn't They will very soon They will. Tomorrow What could it be? Strange. I'm getting GIFs from Tenor after the latest update. Seems they're now sourcing them from multiple places, the same way Twitter does. Whether GIPHY is included in that list, I'm not sure. Video calls. I hope so, can't wait for it It is. I think video calls will arrive in **September**, at the latest. Source?"

I totally be down for a complete revamp Telegram X on Android kinda has something like that for channels (I don't remember if it's on by default or not). It's UI is so much better in many ways that it's kinda sad that it often falls behind in features Is your mockup basically reddit? That’s how it looks more-less like already, minus title at the top. For instant view the link is usually displayed, but a custom button can be added by a bot without any problems I enjoy channels as a text-focus format. IMO cover image puts more distructiion. That's basically just telegra.ph the mockup is for the look. The functionalities can be improved, and every post can be exported as a telegra.ph post to make it easier to read and interact with for ""non-telegramers"". And to make it easy for sharing across the internet. I always thought that having channels just be formatted like ""one-way messages"" was a bit odd. Having them be their own layout could be nice, but it'd still have to support every feature that text chat does.

Hm. I don't have solutions, but the above mockup isn't what I'd want. This no, a suggested improved look for telegram's channels they'll stay text focused format, but with a better look. The admin can chose to use images or not."

Most groups related to crypto are already being tracked by spammers and scammers galore, in an attempt to harvest off of the legitimate communities (Spam adding to other groups, spamming with ads (and spam in general)).

If you want to get into crypto trading, I believe you're better off on sites like `binance.com` or `blockchain.info` (I'm not hotlinking deliberately).

Think twice about ALL decisions you make with crypto, once you confirm and send any crypto currency, it's gone and you have to trust the other side to fulfill their part. Do NOT trust ANYONE that promises they can double your bet/deposit or whatever. What about those bots that claim too “mine”? Are those even worth a try or do they just spam ads with nothing in return? ~~Bots that claim to be yours? What do you mean by that?~~

Nevermind that, you meant bots that mine coins or whatever? Utter bullshit and literally useless. You have better chances with `freebitco.in` lol. There you get something for literally pressing a button once an hour xD

Edit to clarify: I don't want this to sound like a pitch or something, but with freebitco.in you can just leave the page open in the background, press a button and do a captcha every hour and get up to 200 USD in BTC. For being free that isn't that bad tbh. Chances are really fucking low, so I wouldn't really bother. I’ll go try that then XD thx for the help lol I had huge suspicions about the investing already cause they where like asking for a minimum of 300$ which is total wack Oh I see lol sorry I responded before edit, that sounds like it might be slow considering Bitcoin ain’t the fastest You don't have to mine yourself, it's just once an hour you can press it. Yes, you can use multiple Accounts \*wink*

Regarding your other reply: There are a ton of CS:GO skin ""drop"" sites where you get a cool $200 refer code but then you have to deposit $50 to withdraw the skins. Sure sounds about right. Fuck'ed outta there lol Lmao might try that I got a pc and a phone  XD

Anyone else on Android 10 (stock android) facing the same issues? When I try to drag around the cursor I have to do it with caution because I can active the back gesture.

I always accidentally drag the back.. I always use my s pen in this situation..

But, yes.. this has happened. Yep. The Telegram MUST add support to the gestures to fix that...

The Samsung Gallery, for example, it doesn't happen because the gallery tells the system where the gesture can't work. There's countless apps that aren't optimised for all the different swipe gestures cause I can already think of 3 different ones are the top of my head. when I drag up the mic for handsfree recording it brings up my Google assistant... if you want to scroll inside, instead of dragging your finger in, drag it up then inside... it may help It's not issue it's this is a conflict between the system and the application. I'm not sure if it was just a coincidence but try double-tapping on the marker before dragging it Can relate (android 10 stock) It's not much, but hope it helps:

In ""System Navigation"" screen where you select the navigation mode there is a button to adjust the sensitivity of back gestures I'm on Android 10 with my Huawei P20 and I don't use gestures. It's annoying even to me xD

Luckily I don't have to send videos or adjust that box that often haha Yo por eso desactive los gestos Ohhhh. Same. That definitely helps to handle the problem. But it's already at the lowest sensitivity. 

:(

I mean I love that back gesture, definitely. But I get it,  the app is not adapted to gestures. It's now patched! If you want something more complex look for fluid N. G. on the app store, it implements gestures and let's you set dead zones and other way to prevent those. Problems"

I've texted with some of these people and none of them knew me.

How can something like this happen and how do I stop it?

You can see this setting in Settings > Privacy and security > Phone Number.

So this is not a data leak. This is just a setting in the service. This notification is only given if you have their number saved. There is no other way of getting this notification. If you want these notifications to stop, you can either remove all unrecognized phone numbers from you phonebook or disable the notifications in the settings (either privacy, or notification settings). Same here. I'll share my experience with you, in case it helps you figure out anything:

One day I needed to log in to telegram from my dad's phone, and I guess telegram automatically imported his contacts? Since then I've been getting these notifications whenever they join telegram. I've checked every place in my phone to find these contacts but they're nowhere I can access. Multiple factory resets also changed nothing. And I was only logged on to dad's phone for maybe 10mins, and I immediately logged off. I have no clue why this is still happening or how to change it Same thing here. Just a few minutes ago, Telegram alerted me about ""Edgardo has joined Telegram"". I've looked at the telephone and is a complete strange. I don't have this telephone in my contacts at all.

Even I've searched in the local guide and this telephone is from a city that I was never, nor do I have any acquaintances. I.e, a comlete strange. 

Very weird Similar post here

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ajkrm6/random\_person\_joined\_telegram/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/ajkrm6/random_person_joined_telegram/) I wonder if anybody that has this issue had logged in (maybe not by your consent) on another device which then synced those contacts. Have you checked your active sessions?

Settings > Privacy and Security > Active Sessions

 

What you could try is clearing your contacts from Telegram, it should pull it then fresh from your address book.

Settings > Privacy and Security > Delete Synced Contacts Telegram need an option to change uID.

Becuse telegram didnt had an option to hide a phone number this is Telegram's fault that millions of 'uID-phone' leaked. Because of that the only way to resolve this problem is to make an option in telegram ""change my uID' once in a year, or just once,  or just for users which uID-phone was leaked. You get notifications when numbers in the contact list of your close associates join is my theory.
I get work contacts of my dad for example, even though i've never logged in on his devices / he never on mine. You don't understand; Telegram is only supposed to notify you that a contact already saved in your phone has joined. OP is saying that Telegram is showing him totally random people he has never heard of. That, coupled with the default privacy settings means that he has their contact info despite not knowing them at all. If I change the setting you mention, then TG fires a broadcast to all people in the globe alerting that XXYYZZ person joined telegram? I do not think so. I definitely do not have those phone numbers in my address book. Neither do the persons that randomly spawn in my inbox. Why didn't you use Telegram web instead of use your dad's phone?. Anyway this is not my case and today I had ""one <strange> joined telegram"" issue. Hm. Yeah. You're right. Strange. Wait... what?! Telegram's contact list is weird. Contacts remain there forever, even if you remove them from your main contact list. The most probable reason of this is that at some point you added them, remove them and forgot about it.

Also if some old contact changed numbers and it was reassigned. Same thing happens to me! Try removing all contacts from telegram and re-sync then afterwards. Hmm, maybe you logged in to someone else's device with your Telegram account and his phone book contacts have been synced with your Telegram contacts? I‘ve checked every time and I have never had any of these numbers added to my address book. I now went and removed my phone contacts from the telegram servers (Privacy -> Data Settings -> Delete Synced contacts).
Let’s see if that helps"

They were implementing them in the clients but then evidently they changed their mind.

messages.sendReaction#25690ce4 flags:# peer:InputPeer msg_id:int reaction:flags.0?string = Updates;
``` Hmm. I'm not sure about this honestly but if it is true... 

Please, 2 things: 

1. **Only available for groups**: But if most people would like to have that in a 1-1 conversation (because I personally don't see the point of that feature in 1-1 chats) the second must definitely be. 

2. **To make a reaction people must ""tap and react"" rather than ""hold and react""**: like that shitty mechanism on Messenger (when I was using that trash of app I accidentally reacted to messages when I was just scrolling through the conversation).

Please. 😣 Oh nice. I hope they bring thumbs Up and down too.  Thumbs up is really handy for group planning and stuff I'm excited, more features the better! I really hope this is true. I would love it. Gimme videocalls instead. Signal seems to be doing this, too. Why does everyone have to do what iPhone does? why are resources being spent to add more bloat instead of  important features like encryption for group chats and video calls? You got it wrong. I meant to say 'reaction' is stupid and Telegram doesn't need it. Where did you find this? I thought the server side isn't publicly accessed unlike the client side No. please I'd love this feature in groups especially. (But seriously they could be useful everywhere. Even channels!)

It's such a quick way of expressing how u feel about a piece of content etc. Nothing else can compensate for it.

They could have 2 modes. React identifiable/React anonymously. As for 1-1 chat, I can see this being useful if you want to let the other person know you read the message without having to respond. I frequently respond with 👌or 👍for that reason, so I personally wouldn't see a reason *not* to include reactions in private chats.

As for tap-to-react, how exactly do wish the workflow to be? (assuming there are like 4-5 emojis to react with on a message) Why would you ditch it from 1-on-1 conversations? Doesn’t make any sense

I wish message pins were brought there too honestly Disagree with both your points. I pretty much only use reactions in 1-1 chats on messenger. It makes conversations much more personal because the reactions take the place of having to type out lol or yeah/no. I really like them and can't wait for telegram to have them, too. 

Also hold and react is much easier and faster than tap and react. Why would telegram gimp a feature and make conversing slower? While I do want this feature I'd like to argue that caution has to be used too. More feature also means more code and more code means more bugs and higher latency (possibly). I already find the voice calls unreliable as is. I don't think just because Apple does something that it is therefore off limits. That's a ridiculously dumb ideology. I think it’s more in response to Slack and Teams where reactions are immensely used. why is everybody using a smartphone just because apple launched one? Telegram needs to decide what's more important for them. I guess they want to get more users and these features are a good way to reach that. 

My personal experience is: I could only get people to Telegram by showing some gorgeous animated stickers. they need kids as users :-) Indeed. I feel reaction are some kind of stupid preteen shit. They belong to Instagram, messenger and the likes. They were in the Android (5.11), in beta versions As for the workflow I imagined something like: 

You tap a message, the little menu will appear (where are options like ""reply, copy, forward, delete"") and a you'll see a new option called ""React"" or something like that, then you select your reaction and it's done. 

Hold and react (hold the message and select your reaction) is easier, I know, but it's kind of annoying if you're scrolling through the conversation because you can activate that by accident. 

While I was writing this... *Wouldn't be cool if you could customize the emojis for reactions?* Just saying. Because when I'm chatting with my friends I just answer to their messages with emojis, ""laughing"" or things like that (if they said something funny, lovely, etc) and then we keep on with the conversation. *To me*, reactions there, are similar to the action of giving a like to a post someone made. Chats 1-1 are more active/alive and not like a post that someone made which you'll need to quickly react to. 

Groups not so much because you can loose the interest in the conversation (because it's constantly changing, so you see that it behaves like an Instagram Feed) quickly so you'll need something ""Quick"" for that reason, which are reactions. 

I didn't see the point of this at all but then I realized that it is very useful for groups or even channels. There is where it has more sense. If someone says something funny, people could just react to it instead of sending 50 times the same ""hahaha"". Counterpoint: Telegram has a lot more features than Whatsapp and still runs smoother. Apple didn't launch it first.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone#Forerunner

Apple just makes what everyone else did long before, with a better marketing. Those sticker sure are good! They’re kinda useful sometimes though. If you switch from other platforms, you do feel the lack of them.

For example imagine some planning on a group, people can throw ideas, and others could seamlessly react with thumbs up and down to vote Isn't holding the message activating the menu of options already? (at least on iPhone)

I'm also a little confused how a simple tap is not more error prone when scrolling through the messages than holding a message - or did you mean that simply holding a message already causes a reaction without the other menu items on display?

Definitely advocating for custom reactions! Love that idea Yeah Signal and Discord already have custom reactions, and I think it's absolutely great tbh. A welcome addition to telegram I would say I see. Though in my conversations I tend to mention many topics at once, so if someone says one thing and you carry on another topic, it’s easier to just react with laugh or thumb up or heart to show that you did acknowledge that message. I think it feels pretty natural, just like in irl conversations, where we physically react to things people say. Some say non-verbal communication is far more important than verbal. Of course we could swipe on a message and send an emoji as a response to it, but I don’t know, sometimes that feels like too bold, if that makes any sense. Though that’s what I’m usually doing anyways.

I think the real question would be, what approach should they take with those reactions? Should it be a small predefined list? Any emoji? Or maybe even custom ones like on Discord? There are custom sticker packs, masks, themes, one might think emoji packs are a logical continuation of that. And all these ideas push the reactions further from being put to life xd Because would the always-innovative Telegram want to just copy what everyone else has 1:1 like others do copy from it the other side? That other code might be worse doesn't negate my points. All I am saying is: be careful what you wish for. often times straight up stealing, just like xerox I guess that is what polls are for I'm sorry if I wasn't clear enough. 

I don't know about the iPhone but in android you tap a message and you'll see like a panel to make quick actions. In reality, it wouldn't be ""tap and react"" and more like ""tap-tap-tap and react"" because when you *tap* in the imaginary option *""React""* you'll now get the reactions panel. So it's like 3 steps: 

1. Tap to make the quick panel appear. 
2. Tap the ""react"" option (that will then show you the reactions available).
3. Tap in the reaction that you want. 

In hold to react it's more like: 

1. Hold and scroll your finger to select your reaction (that's how it works in Messenger). 

So you see that the first one has 2 more steps. That would make it less likely to do by accident. Yes, but they’re not as seamless, you need to press a button, add options, and since the beginning assume that it’s something people are gonna vote on. Not denying polls are a very useful tool, but that’s a bit different use case I believe"

Deleting for everyone;23;gv0fvd;Telegram;https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/gv0fvd/deleting_for_everyone/;23;If a message gets deleted for everyone will they get a notification or any indication that i deleted that message for everyone or does it just go unseen?;2020-06-02 07:26:21;"It simply disappear from both devices, not notification nor trace about the deletion. It may still persist on thier notification bar. If you send message and deleted it in group, administration of group can still see it in recent activity. Remember OP, if you're on a group chat :""clear chat history"" will only work on your screen, everyone else will still see the message, you got to long press the message, select it, then delete it using the garbage can icon Sometimes the notification will be there but no link will be available. 
If it's an old post they won't unless they go and look for it. Only exception being admins who can see the message through the ""Recent Actions"" for the next 48 hours. I learned the hard way after years of using telegram that this is NOT the case on whatsapp. Very embarrassing. 

(Just another reason whatsapp sucks) No it will be deleted. Yes, it will depend on how the operating system manages the notifications. The major recent OS will clear it, but there's some that still keep it in the notification bar or screen, also for the smartwatches that receive notifications. Will the admin see a notification on their phone or any indication that the message was deleted unless they look for it? I didn’t get what you meant but we all know how much WhatsApp sucks haha 👍 That's not *always* the case. They have to manually open the admin panel and open the recent actions to see what had happened in the group. There is no update notifying them about a message being deleted.

This would be kinda technical and too in-depth, but they could set up a custom client that runs on a server that fetches a raw update that tells clients that this specific message was deleted. This update only includes the ID of the message, not it's content, but that way you could set up a notification about messages being deleted. When you delete a message on WA it says *message deleted* which can be pretty awkward And even if it disappears, phones have a log backup of all notifications even after they disappear. I always use it to know what was deleted. What happens if we kick members will they be able to still see the group and it's content or will it dissapear ? (the group is in private)  


I'd like that they cannot find me anymore nor the groupe And if I just delete my groupe (private one) what will happen, they will not be able to find the group right? If you save all messages you can find the deleted message with ease Yeah, so damn disgusting. Sometimes it’s really necessary to delete messages and not be asked “what did u delete? No, tell me tell me”. 🙄😂 You cannot find deleted groups. They are deleted, after all..... This would require saving all messages, and I doubt anyone would go through the effort of saving all messages just in case something gets deleted. It only says delete and leave, I'm scared it leaves me from the group and the other members will have controll of it"
